AB  - In 2025, 300 million people require humanitarian assistance, with sexual and reproductive health (SRH) crises driving 60% of preventable maternal deaths in conflict-affected countries. Despite the proven life-saving impact of the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for SRH in Crisis Situations, official development assistance for SRH declined by 27% between 2022 and 2023, threatening implementation in fragile settings. Analysis of MISP Readiness Assessments across 64 countries (2021–2024) reveals critical gaps: while 95% have national emergency policies, only 40% of these integrate essential MISP services. With four in five countries at risk of missing 2030 maternal mortality targets, urgent action is imperative. Countries must anchor MISP into national disaster frameworks, establish dedicated SRH emergency funding, mandate MISP training for frontline providers, and integrate preparedness into health system strengthening. Reaffirming political and financial commitment to MISP is imperative to prevent preventable deaths and safeguard SRH as a core component of humanitarian and health system resilience. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect. Environmental risk factors, including air pollution, are increasingly identified as contributors to the risk profile of CHD. We sought to investigate the temporal association between frequency and severity of fetal CHD with air quality in the D.C. metropolitan region. Methods: We queried all fetal diagnoses of CHD at a tertiary care center over a 5-year period, inclusive of a wildfire smoke event. We categorized each case as critical or non-critical CHD and assigned the case to the estimated month of delivery. We used descriptive statistics to show temporal trends in fetal CHD and the relationship with publicly available air quality data. Results: Of the 685 CHD cases, approximately 60% were considered critical CHD. The highest number of cases occurred in March 2024 (coincident with a periconception period in June 2023 during peak wildfire smoke exposure). An additional peak in CHD cases in February 2023 also coincided with a worse air quality peak during the cardiac embryonic period. However, there was no change in the percentage of critical CHD during these peaks. Conclusion: Our work highlights the possibility of environmental pollution, specifically wildfire smoke exposure, as a risk factor for fetal CHD. © 2026 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Background: – Breastfeeding mothers and their infants face unique risks during climate-related disasters, including disrupted access to protective factors such as healthcare, communication, and social support systems. Although breastfeeding provides critical immunological and nutritional benefits, early weaning often occurs due to stress, inadequate preparedness, poorly coordinated relief efforts, operational barriers, dislocation, and prolonged adversity. Purpose: – This paper proposes a structured approach to enhance neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) preparedness for, and breastfeeding support during, climate-related disasters by integrating Kumpfer’s Resilience Framework with the Communication, Maintaining Health, Independence, Safety, Support, and Self-determination, and Transportation (CMIST) Framework. Results: – Kumpfer’s Resilience Framework illustrates how mothers adapt their breastfeeding goals during climate-related disasters, shaped by responses to the surrounding environment and internal resiliency factors. The CMIST Framework guides NICU nurses in assessing disaster-related needs and functional considerations for mothers and infants. Integrating these frameworks enables NICU nurses to identify preparedness gaps, assess available resources, and implement contextually tailored interventions. This approach promotes critical thinking within disaster contexts and supports individualized adaptation of breastfeeding goals by addressing disaster-related needs. Implications for Practice and Research: – The combined use of Kumpfer’s Resilience Framework and CMIST offers a nonprescriptive, adaptable guide for NICU nurses to enhance climate-related disaster response strategies that support breastfeeding mothers. NICU nurses can contribute to disaster planning within hospitals, governmental agencies, and nongovernmental organizations to address the needs of breastfeeding mothers and infants. Future research should examine which NICU-specific climate-related disaster preparedness efforts strengthen and optimize maternal resilience and breastfeeding outcomes across diverse settings. © 2026

AB  - The risks and attributable burden of adverse birth outcomes from flooding remain unclear. Here, we analyzed a nationwide cohort of over 4.4 million mother-infant pairs in China, matching a spatiotemporal flood database with multiple buffer zones centered on maternal delivery hospitals to assess the health risks of multi-window flood exposure before and during pregnancy. We found that flood exposure during the three months preconception and the first trimester significantly increased the risks of preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA), and term low birth weight (TLBW). Based on exposure assessment within a 3000-meter buffer, we estimate that between 2013 and 2019, first-trimester flood exposure accounted for 925,717 attributable cases of PTB (95% Uncertainty Interval [UI]: 814,446–1,035,426), with an attributable fraction (AF) of 13.56%; 418,333 cases of LBW (95% UI: 359,916–475,711; AF, 13.47%); 263,977 cases of SGA (95% UI: 101,700–424,152; AF, 2.81%); and 591,283 cases of TLBW (95% UI: 364,246–810,774; AF, 9.23%). This study quantifies a major perinatal health burden from flooding and identifies critical windows for intervention before and during early pregnancy. © © 2026. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: The state of pediatric disaster readiness of United States emergency departments is largely unknown. Using the questions from the National Pediatric Readiness Project (NPRP) 2021 assessment, we sought to define the domains important for a hospital's disaster response for children, develop a consensus-based pediatric weighted disaster readiness score (WDRS), measure the state of pediatric disaster readiness, and identify gaps in disaster planning. Methods: The 2021 NPRP assessment identified 8 domains of disaster readiness. Using an iterative consensus-based approach, we determined weighting for each of these disaster domains. We calculated a normalized pediatric WDRS for all hospitals that participated in the NPRP assessment (range, 0-100 points). Results: Of 5150 hospitals surveyed in the 2021 NPRP assessment, 3647 responded, and 3458 (94.8%) of these had complete data. Median WDRS was 52.0 (IQR, 36.0, 75.0). Higher WDRS was associated with the presence of a pediatric emergency care coordinator, a comprehensive quality improvement plan for children, staffing with board-certified emergency physicians, and trauma center designation with adult and pediatric capabilities. The WDRS was highly correlated with the NPRP's day-to-day readiness score (r = 0.88). Common missing elements in disaster plans included the lack of pediatric patients in disaster drills and plans for children with behavioral health conditions and special health care needs. Conclusion: Overall, pediatric disaster readiness in the United States is low with high variability across hospitals. Disaster readiness is linked with day-to-day pediatric readiness of emergency departments to care for children. © 2025

AB  - Background: The association between wildfire smoke (WFS) exposure and pregnancy loss has been understudied. Here, we examined the association between prenatal wildfire-specific particulate matter ≤2.5µm (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) exposure and pregnancy loss in Colorado, USA. Methods: We retrieved all birth records from the 17 ‘Front Range’ counties (just east of the Rocky Mountains) of Colorado from 2007 to 2018 (n=614 321). We considered two PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposures—wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> from a novel machine learning model and non-wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> constructed using the Community Multiscale Air Quality model. We fitted quasi-Poisson distributed lag models to estimate the associations between the two weekly-resolved PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposures during pregnancy and live birth-identified conceptions (LBICs) in each county. That is, we used the predicted change in the LBICs to directly infer the change in the number of pregnancy losses due to the exposure. Results: Average weekly non-wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> was 6.2µg/m3 (SD 2.3). In weeks with non-zero WFS (27% of all county-weeks), the average wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> was 0.92µg/m3 (SD: 1.55). Wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> appeared important in gestational weeks 6–13—a 1-µg/m3 higher exposure sustained in these gestational weeks was associated with 20 [95% confidence interval (CI): 4–34] losses/year. In contrast, the cumulative association with non-wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> was stronger—a 1-µg/m3 higher exposure sustained in every week of pregnancy was associated with 84 (95% CI: 46–129) losses/year. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that both wildfire-specific and non-wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposures were associated with more pregnancy loss and add to the growing literature on the harmful effects of wildfires and, more broadly, air pollution. © The Author(s) 2026.

AB  - Extreme climate events have increased the frequency and intensity of environmental extremes, impacting children, particularly infants. To systematically investigate how infant mortality is temporally related to extreme climate events, we created a mathematical model to demonstrate the transitory nature of the relationships in India over the period 1990–2022, using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method as an econometric approach with time series mathematical modeling. This method enables to estimate variables dynamic relationships in both the long and short run, and is ideal for addressing the complexity of extreme climatic event interactions. The empirical findings indicate that particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>), and increased frequency of natural disaster events have a significant positive relationship with higher infant mortality rates in both long and short-run, as 1 % rise in disasters and PM<inf>2.5</inf> levels results in 0.05 % and 0.12 % rise in infant mortality rates respectively in the long run. The increased occurrence of vector-borne diseases has revealed mixed results as rise in malaria by 1 % leads to rise in infant mortality rates by 0.21 % in the long-run, while dengue has a negative association in the long-run. The rise in temperature and carbon emissions demonstrated a negative link with the infant mortality rate in both long and short-run. This study highlights the need for climate-resilient health systems and the need for early warning systems to protect infant health amid increasing climate extremes. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objectives This study aims to investigate the relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and sleep quality among pregnant earthquake survivors. Method A cross-sectional study was designed. The sample consisted of 272 pregnant earthquake survivors who were admitted to a hospital in southern Türkiye. Data were collected using The Personal Information Disclosure Form, The Impact of Event Scale (IES), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression. Results The mean IES total score was 41.37±19.73. The mean scores for the IES subscales were: Intrusion 15.17±8.19, Avoidance 15.25±6.74, and Hyperarousal 10.95±6.40. Considering the diagnostic cut-off value of 33 for PTSD on the IES, the mean IES score among the pregnant women in this study (41.37±19.73) indicates that their PTSD levels were above average and they were found to be at risk for PTSD. In general, positive, significant, but weak correlations were observed between the scale scores. A non-significant, positive, and very weak correlation was found between the IES and PSQI total scores (p>0.05). Conclusion Pregnant earthquake survivors exhibited elevated PTSD levels and poor sleep quality. Although the association between PTSD and sleep quality was weak, the findings highlight the need for psychological screening and supportive interventions in antenatal care following disasters. © 2026 Georg Thieme Verlag.

AB  - The increase in the frequency, duration, and intensity of wildland fires is a significant source of air pollution that can impact perinatal outcomes. This study assessed associations between wildfire fine particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and adverse birth weight outcomes among singleton term births in California for 2007–2018. Exposure was assessed using bias-corrected Community Multiscale Air Quality Model, linked to residence at delivery. Logistic and linear regression models estimated associations between average daily wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> and birth weight outcomes, adjusting for individual-level sociodemographic covariates and seasonality. We conducted race/ethnicity-stratified analyses to assess whether the influence of wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> differed among racially marginalized populations. In a sample of 4,537,418 term births, a 1 μg/m3 increase in wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of large for gestational age and an increase in birth weight, as well as moderately decreased odds of low birth weight and small for gestational age. These associations were more pronounced among Hispanic individuals and those in the Other race category.

AB  - This study investigates the spatiotemporal trends of drought and its impact on child health in South Africa, focusing on low birth weight (LBW) and severe acute malnutrition in children under five. We collected data on child health indicators (LBW and malnutrition) and social determinants, including orphan status, child food poverty, proximity to clinics, water access, and sanitation access, from the Children's Institute at the University of Cape Town. Environmental data, comprising the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and maximum temperatures, were retrieved from MODIS, Global SPEI, and TerraClimate datasets, covering 2002 to 2022. We then fitted a series of linear regressions and combined them into a structural equation model to explore relationships between socio-environmental factors and child health outcomes. Results indicate that the Northern Cape, Western Cape, and Free State are highly vulnerable to agricultural drought, with NDVI showing a strong negative association with LBW and malnutrition. Orphan status emerged as a stronger predictor of malnutrition than drought. The impact of orphan status on malnutrition level is mediated by limited access to basic services such as water and sanitation. Proximity to clinics significantly influenced access to basic services, highlighting a double burden of healthcare and environmental deprivations. These findings expose the need for targeted interventions to enhance food security, water, and sanitation access, particularly for orphaned children, and to integrate drought mitigation into child health policies in South Africa. © 2026.

AB  - The international development of post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) began in the 1990s and is now common practice in many countries. It is a complementary technique to other forensic investigations, with its utility well demonstrated in the literature. PMCT has shown greater sensitivity than autopsy in detecting foreign bodies, fractures—particularly facial and spinal—and gas collections. It has multiple applications, including cases of violent death (such as polytrauma, gunshot wounds, stab wounds and mass disasters), severely degraded bodies (either decomposed or charred), foetal death and sudden infant death. The semiology of PMCT differs from that of ante-mortem CT, and its interpretation should be carried out in close collaboration with the institute of forensic medicine by trained and experienced personnel. © 2025 SERAM.

AB  - Disaster-related prenatal maternal stress, whether due to natural or human-made crises, can have profound effects on offspring health and development. This narrative review synthesizes research findings on the epigenetic mechanisms through which prenatal maternal stress influences long-term offspring health outcomes. Focusing primarily on DNA methylation, we examine how exposure to stress during gestation alters the epigenetic profile and may contribute to mental, cognitive, and physical health vulnerabilities. Studies were categorized based on disaster type, including time-limited events such as hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes, and stressors like the COVID-19 pandemic and famine. Key findings highlight the timing of exposure, sex-specific epigenetic effects, and the potential for epigenetic markers to mediate stress-induced health outcomes. While considerable progress has been made, our review emphasizes the need for further research on how epigenetics may mediate mental health outcomes and the development of interventions that target these molecular mechanisms. © © 2026 President and Fellows of Harvard College.

AB  - Climate change has resulted in increased extreme weather events, including prolonged heat waves, extended wildfire regions and seasons, and more frequent hurricanes and flooding. These events create problems with access to health services, shelter, potable water, diminished air quality, and increased incidence of vector-borne disease that affect the health of pregnant women and families. Nurses caring for pregnant women must have the knowledge to identify and respond to climate change–related health risks. Nursing care related to heat, wildfires and wildfire smoke, hurricanes, and flooding must include accurate assessments and discharge planning that addresses women's health conditions within the context of environmental risks. The purpose of this article is to raise awareness of the clinical nursing care of pregnant women related to heat, wildfires, hurricanes, and flooding in the era of climate change. © 2026 Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses

AB  - Objective: To examine associations between prenatal wildfire smoke exposure and neonatal outcomes. Design: Population-based retrospective analysis. Setting: Washington State. Participants: Data from 526,649 live births between 2010 and 2018. Methods: We used pooled cross-sectional birth records data with computed number of wildfire smoke days to examine effects of prenatal exposure on gestational age at birth, birth weight, Apgar scores, and NICU admissions using regression analysis. Results: We found small increases in gestational age with wildfire smoke exposure in trimester 1 (B = 0.003, 95% CI [.003, .004], p < .001), trimester 3 (B = 0.011, 95% CI [.011, .012], p < .001), and across pregnancy (B = 0.003, 95% CI [.003, .004], p < .001), and a small decrease in trimester 2 (B = –0.002, 95% CI [–.002, .002], p < .001). We observed small increases in birth weight with exposure in trimester 2 (B = 0.303, 95% CI [.201, .405], p < .001) and across pregnancy (B = 0.148, 95% CI = [.086, .210], p < .001). No differences were found for Apgar scores. Finally, we found a 0.003% increase in NICU admissions with exposure in trimesters 1 and 2 (OR = 1.00, 95% CI [1.002, 1.004], [1.001,1.004], respectively) and a 0.002% increase with exposure across pregnancy (OR = 1.002, 95% CI [1.001, 1.003]). Conclusion: Prenatal exposure to wildfire smoke had limited effects on neonatal outcomes. Although associations with gestational age and birth weight aligned with prior studies, our findings were not clinically meaningful. © 2026

AB  - The complexity of monsoonal systems in Indonesia, driven by large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions and local climate variability, requires the practical use of models for accurate rainfall prediction. This study presents an enhanced forecasting model for the Indonesian Monsoon Index (IMI) that integrates the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodologies. We utilized ERA5, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts v.5 global reanalysis, zonal wind data at 850 and 200 hPa, and 30 years of precipitation data validated against in situ observations. This data was used to develop a modified IMI and assess its applicability in two selected regions: the North Coast of Java and East Kalimantan Province. Seasonal ARIMA modeling indicates robust short-term predictive capabilities (R² = 0.90) for five-month forecasts despite diminished performance in the presence of non-linear patterns or sudden climatic transitions. To address these limitations, a hybrid ANN-ARIMA model was adopted, which improved forecast accuracy by up to 8 months while increasing correlation (R² = 0.91) and reducing the risk of overfitting. This hybrid model effectively captures irregular seasonal variations, outperforming the conventional ARIMA, and provides more advanced tools for long-term forecasting under variable climatic conditions. In addition, the analysis revealed a notable connection between rainfall anomalies on the North Coast of Java and specific phases of the monsoon index, highlighting a significant influence of monsoons on local weather patterns. The improved predictive capabilities of the hybrid model is valuable for planning and decision-making in agriculture, water management, and disaster preparedness. © (2025), (Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos).

AB  - Purpose of Review: Pregnant women across the globe, in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), face various dietary obstacles during their pregnancy. In this region, characterized by diverse cultural preferences and traditions, emergencies such as conflicts, natural disasters, epidemics, and displacement continue to exist. This influences food insecurity in the region, particularly among pregnant women. This review aims to enhance maternal and fetal health by analyzing these nutritional challenges and assessing women's nutrient consumption in accordance with the USDA's 2020–2025 Nutritional Guidelines for Pregnant Women, with particular attention to significant nutrient deficiencies. It provides a comprehensive examination of the existing literature and data regarding maternal nutrition in the EMR, highlights deficiencies in data collection and analysis, calls for national surveys, and emphasizes the necessity of raising awareness about the adequate nutrition to improve health outcomes for mothers and their infants in the region. The USDA guidelines were selected for comparisons as they are internationally recognized standards. To enhance the analysis, WHO regional standards were also used, offering context-specific insights that complement the USDA framework. Recent Findings: Pregnant women in the EMR commonly experience nutrient inadequacies, particularly in carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables. A healthy nutritious diet during pregnancy contributes to optimal fetal growth and increases the potential for long-term health for mothers and their offspring. Many antioxidants (vitamin A, C, and E, carotenoids and flavonoids) are derived from the inclusion of vegetables and fruits in pregnant women’s diets. Additionally, they also provide folates, potassium and fiber. Starchy carbohydrates and fiber containing whole grain cereals and vegetables are the fundamentals of a healthy diet allowing for good body’s functioning and providing energy as a primary source. Whole grain cereal products are particularly rich in minerals, vitamins, and dietary fibers. The study highlights lack of intake in milk and dairy products, sources of iodine, essential for cognitive fetal growth, in addition to an insufficient amount of vitamin D, which is protective against gestational diabetes, as well as vitamin C, essential for immunity and antioxidant properties. The findings emphasize the importance of conducting national surveys among pregnant women in the EMR Region countries to gain a clearer understanding of their food intake and inform the development of targeted interventions. Summary: The study focuses on significant nutrient deficiencies and dietary challenges faced by pregnant women in EMR, emphasizing the need for targeted surveys and educational initiatives. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Increasing evidence links exposure to extreme weather events in utero with adverse health outcomes at birth, including lower birth weight. This research, however, often faces data limitations because natural disasters may be localized, often affecting some neighborhoods but not others, whereas outcome data are often available only at higher geographic levels, such as counties. In this article, we introduce a novel strategy for estimating the effects of geographically bounded disasters when localized outcome data are unavailable. We employ this strategy to estimate the effect of exposure to severe tornadoes on infant birth weight in the United States from 1991 to 2017. We merge county-month data on singleton births with block-group-level monthly data on the paths of severe tornadoes and block-group data on the distribution of the population at risk of a birth. We then estimate difference-in-differences models in which the treatment variable is equal to the percentage of the population at risk of a birth affected by the tornado. This strategy results in an estimand that is both more interpretable and more policy-relevant than estimands from traditional models. Our findings demonstrate that exposure to a tornado during pregnancy reduced birth weight for Black mothers. © © 2025 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to PM2·5 from wildfire smoke during pregnancy has been implicated as a risk factor for preterm birth. We investigated this association in the prospective nationwide US Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Cohort, focusing on prenatal wildfire PM2·5 exposure intensity, duration, and timing. METHODS: In this cohort analysis, we included live singleton births recorded in the ECHO Cohort with available data on gestational age at birth and birthweight and dates of conception between Jan 1, 2006, and March 20, 2020. Census tract-level estimates of daily mean wildfire-derived PM2·5 for the years 2006-20 from a previous machine learning model were linked to residential address history. We calculated the mean concentration of daily wildfire PM2·5, days with wildfire PM2·5 (>0, ≥2·5, ≥5·0, and ≥10·0 μg/m3; termed smoke days) and consecutive smoke days (2, 3, or ≥4 days; termed smoke waves) above the prespecified concentration thresholds across pregnancy. Associations of cumlative pregnancy wildfire PM2·5 exposure with preterm birth (delivery before 37 weeks of gestation) were analysed by adjusted pooled logistic regression in the nationwide ECHO sample and in the US West census region. Associations between smoke days in gestational weeks 0-35 and preterm birth were evaluated by logistic regression in the national sample. FINDINGS: We included 20 034 births from 30 ECHO Cohort study sites, with residences during pregnancy in all 48 contiguous US states and the District of Columbia. 1687 (8·4%) of the 20 034 infants were preterm. The mean daily wildfire PM2·5 concentration during pregnancy was 0·36 μg/m3 (SD 0·46), with exposure to a mean of 22·2 smoke days (SD 16·6) of any wildfire PM2·5 concentration (>0 μg/m3). Estimates of association between wildfire PM2·5 exposure metrics and preterm birth included the null in nationwide analyses; whereas, in the US West sample (N=5807), we estimated increased odds of preterm birth associated with mean daily wildfire PM2·5 (odds ratio [OR] 1·139 per 1-μg/m3 increase [95% CI 1·001-1·296]), exposure to smoke days with a wildfire PM2·5 concentration of 5·0 μg/m3 or greater (OR 1·018 per additional smoke day [1·003-1·032]) and 10·0 μg/m3 or greater (OR 1·030 [1·006-1·054]), and exposure to ≥4-day smoke waves of 5·0 μg/m3 or greater (OR 1·185 per additional smoke wave [1·044-1·347]) and 10·0 μg/m3 or greater (OR 1·232 [1·029-1·475]). At the national level, by week of gestation, associations with preterm birth were observed in mid-pregnancy for smoke days with wildfire PM2·5 concentrations above 0 μg/m3, of 2·5 μg/m3 or greater, and of 5·0 μg/m3 or greater, and in late pregnancy for smoke days of 10·0 μg/m3 or greater. INTERPRETATION: In a prospective cohort, we observed increased odds of preterm birth associated with wildfire PM2·5 exposure in the western USA, with findings suggesting an exposure-response relationship for increasing exposure intensity and duration. Preterm birth was also associated with exposure to smoke days in mid-to-late pregnancy at the national level. For practice and policy, these findings support the need for public health interventions aimed at reducing exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy.

AB  - The famine in Gaza represents a case of deliberate and technologically enabled starvation resulting from sustained military actions that have destroyed food systems, obstructed aid, and targeted civilians seeking nourishment. Unlike natural disasters, this crisis demonstrates how digital and military technologies can be weaponized to enforce deprivation. Drawing on recent analyses of famine and mass starvation, including frameworks developed by the World Peace Foundation, this commentary conceptualizes Gaza’s famine as an instance of “engineered starvation,” in which artificial intelligence (AI), precision drones, and biometric surveillance are deployed to dismantle food, water, and energy systems. The resulting collapse has precipitated acute malnutrition, disease outbreaks, and long-term developmental harm, particularly among children and pregnant women. Beyond its immediate toll, this case signals a new paradigm in warfare—the algorithmic management of starvation—as a public health weapon. This analysis underscores the urgent need for global accountability mechanisms, protection of humanitarian infrastructure, regulation of military technologies in conflict zones, and the coordinated rebuilding of essential systems to prevent the normalization of famine as an instrument of war. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Climate change is a major threat to the world's population and is due to global warming from human activities that increase atmospheric greenhouse gas levels—burning fossil fuels, industry emissions, vehicular exhaust, and aerosol chlorofluorocarbons—that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and adversely impact air quality. Resulting higher global temperatures, extreme weather events, and rising sea levels lead to greater frequency of wildfires and floods, which, in turn, result in population displacements and threaten air and water quality, food and water security, economic and public health infrastructures, and societal safety. Climate change has direct and indirect impacts on human health and well-being across the globe, with disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations including women, pregnant persons, the developing fetus, children, older adults, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, preexisting and/or chronic medical conditions, and low income and communities of color. As consequences of climate change, global mortality and noncommunicable diseases are mounting because of lack of progress to reverse current trends. Climate change effects on reproductive processes and outcomes have received less attention globally, despite huge consequences for human development, fertility, and pregnancy outcomes. This review provides evidence for direct and indirect effects of climate change on human health with a focus on reproductive processes and outcomes based on experimental models and epidemiologic data, and strategies to mitigate harms. The goal is to increase awareness about climate effects on reproductive health among clinicians, researchers, the public, and policymakers, and to engage all stakeholders to change the current trajectory of harm. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Extreme weather variations, chronic food insecurity, and lack of coping mechanisms place South Asian children at a high risk of climate-related disasters. This paper estimates the effect of climate anomalies on birth and early childhood health parameters by combining high-resolution climate data with child anthropometry and demographic data from four South Asian countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal). We find temperature and precipitation anomalies to be strong negative predictors of child health outcomes with effects observed both during the in-utero period and extending into the first two years of life. A one standard deviation increase in temperature during the first year of life decreases the weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) by 0.2 standard deviations, while the effect on weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) is about 75% larger in magnitude, decreasing WHZ by 0.35 standard deviations. Similarly, a one standard deviation increase in prenatal precipitation is associated with a decrease of 83 g in birth weight. We further expand on our findings by looking at how these effects differ for groups varying in economic, gender, and social vulnerabilities and uncover stark differences. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.

AB  - Background: Climate change is a growing threat to human health, particularly in regions facing overlapping environmental hazards and social inequities. Puerto Rico—a U.S. territory with a colonial history—offers a unique case for examining how multiple disasters, including Hurricane Maria, ongoing earthquakes, and the COVID-19 pandemic, interact with structural vulnerabilities to affect maternal and child health. Despite increasing attention to climate-related health outcomes, little is known about the reproductive health impacts of cumulative disaster exposure in colonial contexts. Methods: We used U.S. National Vital Statistics System data (2017–2021) to assess associations between disaster exposure and six maternal and newborn outcomes: preterm birth, low birthweight, term low birthweight, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, and excessive weight gain. Disaster exposure was defined based on the timing of hurricanes and the pandemic, using a three-month lag period. We analyzed data from Puerto Rico and used Florida and Texas as comparison sites. Multivariable log-binomial regression models estimated adjusted prevalence ratios. Effect modification was tested for (1) region within Puerto Rico and (2) colonial status, comparing Puerto Rico (territory) to Florida and Texas (states). Simulations were conducted to account for potential live-birth bias. Results: Across 104,560 births in Puerto Rico, disaster periods were consistently associated with worse maternal health outcomes. For example, during the late post-hurricane period, gestational diabetes increased (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31), while term low birthweight surprisingly appeared to decline (RR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.98). Associations with newborn health were mixed and may have been underestimated due to sharp declines in live births after disasters. Simulations suggested stronger disaster-related risks than observed in primary analyses. Effect modification by region and colonial status showed inconsistent but notable differences, particularly elevated maternal health risks in certain regions of Puerto Rico and compared to U.S. states. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that multiple disasters negatively affect reproductive health in Puerto Rico and that structural factors, including colonialism, may exacerbate these impacts. Public health responses must account for cumulative disaster exposure and systemic inequities to better support maternal and child health in marginalized settings, especially as climate change continues to intensify. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Pregnant women are at high risk of developing adverse mental health outcomes, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), following climate-related disasters. Childhood maltreatment (CM) may be a pre-existing risk factor that increases vulnerability to PTSD in women exposed to flood-related consequences. Objective: To examine the associations between CM and PTSD symptoms, residential displacement due to flooding and PTSD symptoms, and to test whether these exposures interact to increase the risk for PTSD symptoms. Participants and setting: This cross-sectional included 259 women who gave birth within one year after the unprecedented 2024 flood-related climate disaster in Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. Participants were recruited during the puerperium from two tertiary hospitals in the state capital. Methods: PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PCL-5, and childhood abuse and neglect were assessed using the CTQ. Results: Both severe CM (B = 13.1, p = 0.01) and residential displacement (B = 17.0, p = 0.01) were associated with greater PTSD symptom severity. Concurrent exposure significantly amplified symptom severity, resulting in an additional increase of approximately 11.5 points in PCL-5 scores beyond the sum of their individual effects (p = 0.04). Among the CM subtypes, emotional abuse (r = 0.25, p = 0.01) was the form most significantly associated with increased vulnerability to PTSD later in life. Conclusion: These findings underscore the long-term mental health consequences of cumulative traumatic exposures from childhood to adulthood in shaping the risk of PTSD, extending to the context of climate-related disasters. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Research question: Does an association exist between assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycle outcomes and residential proximity to bushfires in Victoria, Australia? Design: Retrospective cohort study of participants undergoing oocyte retrieval at Victoria Monash IVF clinics up to 6 months before or after bushfire events (n = 2001 cycles, July 2019 to June 2020). Data were stratified by cycle date (pre- or post-fires) and by residential postcode (proximal or non-proximal to fires). The proximal regions had active fire within that post code. Analysis of variance (or Kruskal–Wallis test) and Fisher's exact test were used for continuous and categorical data, respectively. Generalized estimating equations and binary logistic regressions were also used, with adjustments for cofactors. Regression was used to access the correlation between time after fires and ART outcomes. Results: Numbers of oocytes retrieved and fertilized, number of embryos used, rates of fertilization, utilization, clinical pregnancy and live birth were similar between proximal and non-proximal groups after the fires. Furthermore, numbers and rates were similar between proximal groups before and after fires, and non-proximal groups before and after fires (P > 0.1). Correlation analyses revealed the strongest trend was in embryo utilization rates over time after fires in the proximal versus non-proximal group in either IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) (R2 = 0.08, P = 0.057) or ICSI only cycles (R2 = 0.09, P = 0.071). The correlation, however, was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Residential proximity to major bushfire events was not associated with any significant alterations to ART outcomes between time- and clinic-matched cycles. As global fire events continue to rise in incidence and severity, associations between bushfire exposure and long-term reproductive outcomes are important factors to consider in future research. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Floods displace an average of 12 million people every year, and are responsible for 54% of all disaster-induced displacements. Displacement risk scales with the vulnerability of exposed populations, but this vulnerability is poorly understood at a global scale. Here we show that measures of human development and rural areas explain more of the variance of displacement vulnerability than income levels measured by gross domestic product. We combine global flood and displacement data to estimate vulnerability, as the ratio of displacement to exposure, for over 300 historical flood events. We find that this vulnerability varies by several orders of magnitude both between and within countries. A random forest regression shows that infant mortality rate and population density are among the most important predictors of displacement vulnerability at national level and within countries, respectively, highlighting the vulnerability of low-income and marginalized populations and of rural communities. Our results indicate that, rather than relying on overall economic development alone, targeted investments are needed to improve living conditions and coping capacities for the most vulnerable groups, particularly outside of large cities, and to prepare for increasing flood hazards due to climate change. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - The paper explores the short-term impact of recovery in the aftermath of a natural disaster on a set of child health outcomes. We analyze the impacts of a major earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 that occurred on the coast of Ecuador on April 16, 2016. As damage was geographically concentrated, affected infrastructure and individuals could be readily identified. We implement a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference (DiD) strategy with geo-referenced data to compare affected and non-affected children, which is complemented by the event study approach, inverse probability weighting, placebo tests, and a synthetic DiD, which together provide a robust empirical framework identifying that the quick and large response of the government compensated for the earthquake-induced destruction. Affected children aged 0–5 years show similar levels of nutrition (weight-, height-, and BMI-for-age) and anemia as non-affected children. There is even some indication from the heterogeneity analyses (birth cohorts) that weight-for-age might have improved after the disaster and in response to the concerted reconstruction. We present exploratory evidence suggesting that the reconstruction activities led to infrastructure improvements, that nutritional programs continued their operations, and mothers in affected areas engaged more in breastfeeding. All three channels are likely to contribute to the stable child health environment in earthquake-affected areas relative to the non-affected areas, suggesting that mitigation of negative health consequences for the weakest members of society, i.e., the children, is possible in the aftermath of a natural disaster if appropriate activities and policies are put in place. © 2025

AB  - Background: Continuing health services after disasters and ensuring that pregnant women receive antenatal care are important to protect the health of mothers and babies.This study aims to investigates the experiences of pregnant women living in temporary shelters cities post-earthquake. Method: A qualitative approach was employed to explore pregnant women experiences during the earthquake, that hit the Pazarcık district of central Kahramanmaraş, Turkey, on February 6, 2023. Sixteen pregnant women participated to study who met the inclusion criteria. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview form and analyzed using MAXQDA qualitative software, following Colaizzi’s seven-stage method. Results: The age range of the pregnant women was 18–36. In line with the data obtained from interviews with these women, four main themes were identified: difficulties in meeting basic life needs (sub-themes of heating, clothing, food/nutrition, drinking water/sanitation/hygiene, and economic needs); difficulties in maintaining pregnancy and protecting health (sub-themes of changes in fetal movements, labor/bleeding, vomiting/weakness, and infection); (1) difficulty receiving antenatal care (sub-themes: inability to have antenatal follow-ups or tests, inability to listen to fetal heart sounds, lack of an ideal birth environment, fear of preterm birth, and lack of weight monitoring); (2) emotional difficulty (sub-themes: fear of preterm birth or not finding an ideal birth environment, crying, helplessness, stress, and shock/panic). Conclusion: During emergencies and disasters, it is crucial to provide necessary pregnancy monitoring, information, and psychosocial support by experienced healthcare professionals. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Anxiety disorders is one of the most prevalent mental diseases globally, with cases rising by over 55% from 1990 to 2019. Recent research suggests anxiety can be contagious and may affect daily routines and parenting practices. In North African and Middle Eastern countries, where people face unique challenges such as natural disasters, war, and economic instability, the impact of anxiety on parenting is not well studied. This study aims to explore how general anxiety disorder (GAD) affects parenting styles and to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of GAD among Libyan parents, which are comparable to parents in the MENA region. Methods: Cross-sectional study was conducted in Libya, a MENA country, the sample included 233 parents aged 18–73 years who were assessed for anxiety and their parenting style by answering a self-administered online survey during the study period (1st May–18th October 2023), using (GAD-7) & (APQ) validated tools. Results: A total of 233 responses were analyzed. It was identified that anxious parents, in contrast to non-anxious parents adopted more poor supervision [β 0.62, 95% CI (0.06–1.19)], corporal punishment [β 0.86, 95% CI (0.18–1.55)] and less parental involvement practices [β −0.8, 95% CI (−1.43 to −0.17)] after adjusting for age, sex, marital status, education, employment, family income, experiencing miscarriage, the number and sex of their children, and having a child with special needs. Additionally, the prevalence of GAD among Libyan parents was (48.93%). Sex [AOR 3.84, 95% CI (1.57–9.39)], family income [AOR 2.05, 95% CI (1.09–3.84)], and the number of children [AOR 3.23, CI (1.09–9.57)] were all significant predictors for anxiety. Conclusion: This study highlights the significant impact of parental GAD on parenting, showing trends like increased corporal punishment, poor supervision, and reduced involvement. These findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions to support anxious parents. Addressing parental mental health can improve family dynamics and break negative intergenerational cycles. Stakeholders and policymakers should prioritize mental health resources to foster positive parenting and mitigate the long-term effects of anxiety on children's development. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Natural disasters can lead to more adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO). It is unclear if the extended COVID-19 pandemic has impacted APOs and pre-existing conditions among perinatal populations with increased risk of severe maternal morbidity and mortality. A retrospective chart review was conducted of hospital records and birth certificates in the largest birth hospital in Louisiana from 2017 to 2022. Amongst 27,877 births (50.9% White, 38.3% Black, 28.9 ± 5.6 years), gestational diabetes (GDM) was lowest in pre-pandemic conceptions (11.0%, June 2017-May 2019) and rose to 16.4% early pandemic (October 2019-February 2020) but leveled off at 12.2% in peak (March 2020-February 2021) and late pandemic (March 2021-September 2021). Individuals who conceived in early and peak pandemic were 47% (95% CI 33, 63) and 11% (95% CI 2, 20) more likely to develop GDM respectively, compared to pre-pandemic conceptions. Individuals who delivered during early (aRR: 1.54, 95% CI 1.33–1.78), peak (aRR: 1.48, 95% CI 1.32–1.65), and late (aRR: 1.62, 95% CI 1.41, 1.85) pandemic were more likely to develop preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome compared to pre-pandemic conceptions. Individuals were also 17% (95% CI 5, 32) more likely to enter pregnancy with chronic hypertension in peak pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. In paired analysis (n = 3390), individuals with a pandemic conception that occurred early pandemic had a higher risk of developing GDM compared to their pre-pandemic pregnancy (aOR 3.26, 95% CI 1.52, 6.97). Supporting birthing individuals amongst significant stressful events, especially in early gestation, is critical for preventing APOs and severe maternal morbidity and mortality. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Wildfire activity is intensifying in Latin America due to climate and land-use changes, but the health impacts of wildfire-derived PM2.5 in urban areas remain poorly quantified and recognized. OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence on wildfire-related PM2.5 and its association with mortality and morbidity in Latin American cities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines, using data from PubMed, Scopus, and Bireme. One reviewer independently screened 163 articles and extracted data from 14 eligible studies. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Most studies were conducted in Brazil (n = 12) and used time-series or modelling designs to estimate health risks. Wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure was associated with allcause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Reported effect estimates ranged from 1.7 to 7.7% increases in risk per 10 μg/m³ of exposure. Other studies assessed preterm birth, COVID-19 outcomes, and site-specific cancers. While two studies provided harmonized RR estimates for all-cause mortality, high heterogeneity and methodological differences prevented formal meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: Wildfire smoke contributes measurably to premature mortality in Latin America, but current evidence is unevenly distributed across regions, time periods, and population subgroups. Studies rarely capture the disproportionate risks faced by indigenous and rural communities or the intraurban disparities linked to poverty and geography. Future research should focus on the health burden of morbidity linked to wildfire PM2.5.

AB  - Background Several independent reviews in the UK have recently investigated sustained, systemic failings by statutory services and government departments. These reviews document severe psychological impacts on people affected by these scandals, which have been exacerbated by miscarriages of justice, denials of accountability and lack of formal support. There is evidence that impacted people have significant, unmet mental health needs. Aims To explore the psychological support needs of people infected and affected by the infected blood scandal in England, their experiences of seeking support and how insights from this research could inform responses to people affected by similar failings, including the Hillsborough Disaster, Windrush Scandal and Post Office Horizon IT Scandal. Method We used a qualitative design involving semi-structured interviews with infected and affected people in England and with mental health practitioners to explore experiences, psychological impacts and perspectives on existing support services. Our analysis was thematic, adopting an empathetic interpretive orientation toward participants’ experiences. Results We identified significant unmet mental health needs among infected and affected people, including those who had been in contact with NHS or private psychological support services. Historically, infected and affected people have rarely accessed effective mental health support. Conclusions Insights from the Infected Blood Inquiry and the subsequent development of a bespoke psychological support service could inform the setting up of skilled, tailored psychological support for people affected by other severe, systemic state failings. This response could address complex, unmet mental health needs and increase understanding of the psychological impacts of scandals resulting from systemic, statutory failings. © The Author(s), 2025.

AB  - Background Climate change is one of the most complex and important health threats of the 21st century. The knowledge of the impact of climate change on health is expanding rapidly. However, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the impact of climate change on the interlinked pregnancy, perinatal and infant periods. Hence, the objective of this study was to provide an overview of the effects of changing weather and climate hazards on maternal and infant health during pregnancy, the perinatal period and infancy. Methods We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed original articles and reviews found in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, Global Health and WHO regional databases on the subject between January 2000 and May 2025. The included articles were in the English language, detailed exposure to climate change hazards during pregnancy, the perinatal period and up to 1 year of age in the child, with an outcome related to health. Results In total, 596 reviews and original articles were included in the analysis. Our findings demonstrate large differences in the number and types of studies for each climate-related hazard. Direct health effects from rising temperatures and extreme weather events, as well as indirect health effects such as infectious diseases, food insecurity, forced migration and socioeconomic changes due to climate change, have clear negative consequences for pregnant women and infants. Conclusions There is a large evidence base showcasing the harmful impact of climate change on pregnant women and infants through a variety of pathways. Action is urgently needed at all levels to address climate change and there is a need to implement large-scale mitigation and adaptation efforts that protect the health and well-being of pregnant women and infants everywhere. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

Our objective was to characterize neonatal readiness at all Maine birthing hospitals and to identify barriers to and resources for improving care.We used a descriptive survey in which hospital leaders completed a 226-question survey followed by a virtual site meeting for data quality assurance. The survey we developed assessed hospital demographics and services, personnel, training, leadership, quality improvement, policies, transport/disaster preparedness, equipment, and barriers to and resources for improving neonatal care. The survey was adapted from existing assessments used for leveling of care and pediatric readiness. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, stratified by state-designated level of care I-IV. From May 2022 to September 2023, all hospitals (N = 23) completed the survey and interview: 18 level I, 3 level II, 1 level III, and 1 level IV. Only 4 hospitals (17%) have on-site pediatricians and 3 (13%) have on-site obstetricians. All level I/II hospitals have access to specialists via phone consultation, whereas only 30% have telemedicine access to neonatology. A total of 87%, 74%, 61%, and 22% require Neonatal Resuscitation Program certification for physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and advanced practice clinicians who staff deliveries, respectively. Site-level qualitative data emphasized the need for additional resources and protected time to plan and implement training.Level I/II hospitals need support in accessing critical resources, both physical resources and pathways for accessing neonatal specialists, including appropriate equipment and increasing the availability of teleconsultations. Educational and clinical support is needed to improve neonatal readiness, which may help retain skilled clinicians and ensure quality of care at hospitals open for deliveries. © 2025 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - We study the long-term effects of early-life exposure to low-dose radiation from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster on adult health and fertility outcomes. Exploiting exogenous variation in radioactive fallout across Italian municipalities, we construct a radiation exposure index and link it to administrative data on hospitalizations (2004–2016) and delivery certificates (2002–2019) for 18 birth cohorts (1976–1993). Women exposed in utero or during early childhood exhibit elevated rates of thyroid disorders, cancer, spontaneous abortions, and stillbirths in adulthood. These effects are not observed among those exposed later in childhood, pointing to heightened biological vulnerability during critical developmental windows. Comparable effects for men are found only for cancer, consistent with women's greater susceptibility to thyroid dysfunction and higher diagnosis rates. We also uncover behavioral heterogeneity in realized exposure: municipalities with higher private avoidance costs and lower socioeconomic status suffered more severe health impacts. In contrast, political alignment with the national government did not predict compliance with safety advisories. Overall, our findings highlight the enduring health consequences of early-life environmental shocks and the role of behavioral frictions in amplifying biological risks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Nurses working in intensive care units (ICUs) engage in an intense and demanding struggle to ensure the survival of newborns, who are among the most vulnerable populations during disasters. It is known that physical, logistical and technical resources are heavily utilised in the treatment and care processes within ICUs. However, our knowledge of how these resources are managed during and after disasters remains limited. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences, challenges and decision-making mechanisms of nurses working in neonatal ICUs (NICUs) during an earthquake. Study Design: This study employed a qualitative exploratory research design with a phenomenological approach. In-depth individual interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide between January and April 2025. A total of 18 nurses who worked in the NICUs of two different hospitals during and after the 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes in Turkey were included in the study using criterion sampling. Data were analysed using inductive content analysis methods. The Max Qualitative Data Analysis (2020) software was used for data coding. Results: As a result of the data analysis, three main themes and 13 sub-themes were identified. The themes were as follows: ‘Emergency Response and Implementation Challenges’, ‘Strategies Developed for the Safety of Newborns’ and ‘Psychological and Emotional Burdens of Nurses’. In addition, the topics ‘Insufficiency in Material Supply’, ‘Problems Arising from Inadequate Staffing’ and ‘Experience of Loss and Grief’ were found to be mentioned more frequently than other codes. Conclusions: The findings showed that nurses faced challenges stemming from multiple professional, organisational, environmental and educational factors during the early phase of the disaster. Participants' perspectives revealed a strong relationship between professional competence in first response, disaster preparedness, traumatic burden and burnout. Relevance to Clinical Practice: Identifying the challenges experienced by vulnerable populations during disasters, integrating these groups into disaster management plans, developing guidelines, promoting professional knowledge exchange and regularly conducting hands-on disaster training are of great importance. © 2025 British Association of Critical Care Nurses.

AB  - In climate change-affected coastal areas, sea level rise, storm surges, droughts and altered rainfalls are significantly increasing salinity levels in drinking water sources. This is a major public health problem that affects many millions of people. We systematically reviewed and assessed the strength and quality of the evidence on the relationship between drinking water with high sodium levels (> 200 mgNa/l) and adverse cardiovascular, renal, and pregnancy-related health outcomes, following the PRISMA guidelines, the ROBINS-E Cochrane tool and the Navigation Guide. From five bibliographic databases, we identified 22 relevant studies, some of which assessed more than one health domain. The evidence was of moderate quality and strength. 14 analyses from eight studies at low risk of bias and four studies at moderate risk of bias, linked drinking high-salinity water to adverse health outcomes including hypertension and cardiovascular disease, impaired renal function, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, and higher infant mortality. Eight studies were inconclusive. Three analyses, of which two at low risk of bias, associated drinking high-salinity water to improved health outcomes. Overall, our findings suggest that salinisation of drinking water sources is likely to increase adverse cardiovascular, renal, and pregnancy-related health outcomes. This conclusion highlights the importance of effective and timely adaptation at scale, and calls for a revision of the WHO guidelines for the intake of salt from water. The latest WHO guidelines (2022) do not set any health-based standard for sodium levels in drinking water, a problem that affects millions of people and will worsen with climate change. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Introduction: Maternal stress during pregnancy has been increasingly recognized as a significant factor influencing fetal development, with potential long-term effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring. Understanding the mechanisms and implications of prenatal stress exposure is crucial for informing preventative and interventional strategies in perinatal care. Content: This narrative review synthesizes findings from epidemiological, neurobiological, and clinical research on the long-term consequences of prenatal maternal stress. It explores a broad spectrum of stressors – including psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and acute traumatic events such as natural disasters – and their associations with cognitive, behavioral, and emotional outcomes in offspring from infancy through adolescence. Key biological mechanisms are discussed, including alterations in the maternal-placental-fetal axis, HPA axis dysregulation, placental gene expression changes, epigenetic modifications, and neuroinflammatory responses. Neuroimaging and biomarker studies are highlighted to provide evidence for stress-related changes in brain structure and function. Summary: Current literature supports a robust association between maternal stress during pregnancy and a heightened risk of neurodevelopmental challenges in children. These include deficits in executive function, increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, emotional dysregulation, and susceptibility to psychiatric disorders. The effects appear to be moderated by timing of exposure, genetic predispositions, and the postnatal environment. Outlook: While the evidence base is growing, methodological limitations such as variability in stress assessment and inconsistent follow-up durations persist. Future research should emphasize longitudinal, biomarker-informed designs and evaluate interventions aimed at reducing prenatal stress. Integrating maternal mental health support into routine prenatal care may offer a promising pathway to improving both maternal and child outcomes. © 2025 the author(s),

AB  - Background: Prior studies show emergency departments (EDs) with high pediatric readiness, measured by the weighted pediatric readiness score (WPRS), are associated with lower pediatric mortality from critical illness and injury. However, associations between hospital inpatient pediatric capabilities and ED pediatric readiness have not been studied. Objective: Our aim was to examine the relationship between inpatient pediatric capabilities and ED WPRS. Methods: Retrospective cross-sectional study with secondary analysis of the 2021 National Pediatric Readiness Project (NPRP) assessment results. Hospital inpatient capabilities were analyzed in combinations of pediatric inpatient units (inpatient, nursery, pediatric intensive care unit, neonatal intensive care unit, adult unit admitting children) and WPRS. Univariable regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between WPRS and volume, ED type, and inpatient capability. Results: 3495 assessments with complete inpatient and scored data were analyzed. Hospitals reporting all pediatric inpatient capability and containing a separate pediatric ED had the highest WPRS (n = 205, median 96.0, [interquartile range (IQR) 87.0, 98.5]). Hospitals with adult units that could admit children had a median WPRS of 61.0 (N = 546, [IQR 53.4, 75.5]). The largest hospital grouping, non-children's hospitals without a separate pediatric ED and no pediatric inpatient capability (N = 804), had a median WPRS of 67.2 [IQR 58.4, 79.8]. Higher inpatient capability showed an overall trend in increased median WPRS with addition of each inpatient unit type. Conclusions: The presence of both a pediatric ED space and all hospital inpatient pediatric capabilities is associated with the highest WPRS. Having pediatric ED space is associated with higher WPRS than any specific pediatric inpatient unit. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A perennial crisis gripping the 21st century has manifested through climate change, with children exposed to the dangers of natural disasters and resource scarcity, thereby leading to psychiatric distress, malnutrition, and escalating mortality rates. This study evaluates how climate change influences infant and under-five mortality rates in advanced and emerging market economies during the 2000–2022 period, employing Kernel Density Estimation procedures alongside Method of Moments Quantile Regression methodologies. The study also incorporates the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change framework and the Socio-Ecological Model to develop a comprehensive understanding of how various social, ecological, and climatic factors are interconnected, resulting in increased child vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. The findings demonstrate connections between CO<inf>2</inf> levels, healthcare expenditure, natural disasters, and per capita income in emerging and advanced economies. However, the differences in PM<inf>2.5</inf> and annual temperature across both economies contradict the prior studies, as a 1 percent rise in PM<inf>2.5</inf> is linked to a 1.96 percent reduction in infant mortality rates in emerging economies. The findings point to the challenges of child vulnerability to climate change, thereby aiding in developing more effective strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on child health. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Exposure to prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) in utero has been associated with several adverse perinatal outcomes, such as pre-term birth and perturbed cognitive development. As the interface between the fetal and maternal compartments during pregnancy, the placenta has been postulated to play a role in this process. We hypothesized that placental DNA methylation (DNAme) may be altered in association with natural disaster-mediated PNMS. Methods: Pooled placental samples from the Queensland Flood Study, or QF2011, cohort (n = 105) were processed for assessment of DNAme using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Results: Overall, we did not find significant associations between placental DNAme and several stress measurements using linear modelling (FDR<0.05 and Δβ>0.03). While we found that XX placentas had slightly higher predicted cytotrophoblast to syncytiotrophoblast cell ratios than XY placentas (p = 0.01), this difference in cell ratio was not associated with PNMS exposure. However, we did observe associations between placental epigenetic age acceleration and all three types of PNMS investigated (objective hardship (QFOSS) (p = 0.03), subjective distress (COSMOSS) (p = 0.03), and maternal cognitive appraisal (CONSEQ) (p = 0.0005) scores). Conclusion: The lack of large global impacts of PNMS on placental DNAme possibly indicates that the placenta can buffer moderate levels of maternal stress during pregnancy. It remains unclear what the impact of increased placental epigenetic age acceleration is on fetal development or perinatal outcomes and will require further investigation. © 2025

AB  - Climate change presents a significant threat to global health, with both immediate and long-term consequences, especially in low-income countries with limited adaptive capacity. Pregnant women, developing fetuses, and youth are among the most vulnerable populations, yet the specific risks they face remain underexplored. This literature review examines the impact of climate change on maternal mortality, focusing on both direct and indirect pathways. We analyzed peer-reviewed studies that address how climate-related events, such as severe droughts, water scarcity, wildfires, rising sea levels, frequent floods, melting polar ice caps, catastrophic storms, and biodiversity loss contribute to complications during pregnancy and childbirth. The evidence suggests that climate change can indirectly increase maternal health risks and mortality through social, economic, and psychological pathways, including inadequate sanitation, population shifts, disrupted healthcare access, malnutrition, and disease transmission. Our findings reveal a consistent pattern of heightened risk for maternal complications and mortality linked to climate-related events. We recommend conducting more country-specific and comprehensive studies to better understand these relationships and inform effective interventions. Policymakers should prioritize efforts to reduce maternal mortality and improve the health of expectant mothers and their newborns in the context of a changing climate. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities contribute to global warming. Despite global efforts to limit temperature rise, recent data show temperature targets continue to be exceeded. Furthermore, human activities have substantially increased the number of chemicals in our environment. These chemicals can both exacerbate global warming, and their toxicity can be impacted by a warming climate. This paper explores how rising temperatures and increased exposure to chemical pollutants interact to amplify adverse health outcomes. We examine the synergistic effects of environmental stressors, focusing on air pollution and extreme weather events. Additionally, we highlight how these environmental threats disproportionately affect socially and economically disadvantaged communities, exacerbating existing health disparities. By integrating insights on climate change, pollution, and social inequities, we aim to underscore the importance of understanding the compounding effects of climate change on human health. This understanding will facilitate a holistic approach essential for creating informed policies and interventions that protect both the environment and human health. © 2025

AB  - Traditionally, to promote an optimal pregnancy trajectory and child development, encompassing both physical and mental health, a preventative focus is crucial and - ideally - exposure to negative influences is supposed to be limited. However, when prevention is not feasible, early identification of developmental impairments is paramount to address potential risk factors for future development. Specifically, one source of developmental impairment is prenatal maternal stress. This umbrella review integrates and summarizes current research on the diverse developmental consequences of prenatal maternal stress caused by natural disasters. The cumulative evidence strongly suggests that the effect of maternal stress during pregnancy does not end after pregnancy but can lead to a wide range of detrimental effects on a child's development throughout the whole lifespan. By synthesizing previous empirical findings, the current review provides an overview about potential congenital developmental difficulties as well as the interdependence of these negative effects. The depicted results highlight a risk of overarching negative effects of prenatal stress for the child. It is stated that in order to prevent possible long-lasting effects this risk has to be effectively taken into account. Possible recommendations for prevention interventions are discussed. © 2025 The Author(s). Stress and Health published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Natural disasters present significant challenges for maternal mental health, particularly among the perinatal population. The increasing frequency of these disasters often exacerbates the emotional, financial, and physical strain on affected individuals. Women in the perinatal period face unique stressors, including hormonal changes, role transitions, and the potential overwhelming responsibility of caring for their newborns, which can intensify the mental health effects of these traumatic events. Natural disasters, such as the Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025, have shown how these stressors can exacerbate anxiety and depression in this population. In this commentary, we underscore the importance of incorporating maternal mental health considerations into disaster preparedness frameworks to ensure that this population receives the support it needs to navigate the challenges posed by natural disasters and mitigate long-term mental health risks. © 2025 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses

AB  - OBJECTIVE: – To determine the cost effectiveness of a policy change making a progestin-only contraceptive pill available over-the-counter (OTC).METHODS: – We created a decision analytic model to determine the cost effectiveness of making an OTC progestin-only contraceptive pill available in the United States in two distinct policy environments: one in which abortion is legal and available and one in which abortion is restricted. Our theoretical population included 1, 000, 000 women at risk of unintended pregnancy over 1 year. We adopted the societal and payer perspective and obtained probabilities, utilities, and costs from the literature. We set the cost-effectiveness threshold at a standard $100, 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Our primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.RESULTS: – In a theoretical cohort of 1, 000, 000 women at risk of unintended pregnancy, having an oral contraceptive pill available OTC was a dominant strategy in both settings; it reduced costs and improved QALYs. In settings in which abortion was available, having an OTC progestin-only contraceptive pill was associated with a $976-million reduction in costs and an increase of 14, 153 QALYs. An OTC progestin-only contraceptive pill strategy would no longer be cost effective if more than 70% of OTC progestin-only contraceptive pill users discontinued usage; OTC progestin-only contraceptive pills would be cost effective for insurers to cover until the monthly cost exceeds $250 per pill pack in an abortion-protective setting.CONCLUSION: – The availability of an OTC progestin-only contraceptive pill is a cost-effective strategy in abortion-protective and abortion-restrictive settings. © 2025

AB  - On 23 October 2015, operators at the Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage field in Northern Los Angeles reported an uncontrolled natural gas leak. The blowout persisted for 112 days, releasing ~109,000 metric tons of methane into the atmosphere. Elevated air toxics and fine particle pollutant levels were also measured in nearby communities. We used California’s birth records and a quasiexperimental design to assess whether pregnant women living in affected communities during the disaster experienced more adverse birth outcomes than expected. Overall, the prevalence of low birthweight and term low birthweight were 45 to 100% higher than expected among women living in the affected communities whose late pregnancy overlapped with the blowout. The strongest effects were observed among women living directly south and southwest of the facility. Furthermore, we observed a dose-response effect, where the odds of low birthweight were highest among women living closest to the well and attenuated out. © 2025 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

AB  - According to the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis, low-birthweight (LBW) infants are programmed to seek additional resources as compensation for early deprivation. However, no study has yet explored this in the context of delay discounting (DD), which refers to the tendency to prefer smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed ones. Both prenatal factors, such as LBW, and postnatal factors, including adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and exposure to natural disasters, may influence DD. To investigate whether LBW children seek larger future rewards, we analyzed LBW's effect on DD, accounting for ACEs and natural disaster exposure. This prospective cohort study involved 167 children from areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE), with a mean age of 8.3 years at the time of the DD experiment. LBW was assessed in the 2012 baseline questionnaire using the Mother-Child Handbook, along with ACEs prior to the GEJE and traumatic earthquake experiences. In 2014, DD was assessed through a token-based experiment where children allocated tokens for either immediate rewards (one candy per token for now) or delayed rewards (two candies per token for one month later). Our results showed that children with LBW and three or more ACEs exhibited lower DD, while traumatic earthquake experiences were not associated with DD. These findings suggest that children with LBW and multiple ACEs may develop adaptive strategies to seek more resources, indicating a responsive reward system to childhood adversity, even after exposure to a severe natural disaster. © The Author(s), 2025.

AB  - Background Climate change has exacerbated the frequency, intensity, and impacts of extreme weather events (EWEs), such as tropical cyclones. However, the increasing impact of tropical cyclones on child mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), remains understudied. Methods and findings Utilizing individual-level data from the Demographic and Health Surveys, we conducted a sibling-matched case-control study to assess the impact of cyclone exposure over the past 3 months on under-five mortality. The study included 100,798 under-five deaths and 247,445 controls across 34 LMICs from 1993 to 2021. After adjusting for key meteorological and temporal confounders and maternal age, significant positive associations were observed between under-five deaths and cyclone exposure over the past 3 months before death (odds ratio [OR]: 1.038, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.002, 1.075; p=0.041). Specifically, the strongest effects were observed in the first month before death (OR: 1.101, 95% CI: 1.039, 1.166; p<0.001), diminishing in the second and third months before death. We estimated that cyclone exposure 0–30 days before death may have caused 0.85 million under-five deaths (95% CI: 0.35 million, 1.32 million) in countries exposed to cyclones from 2000 to 2020. As an observational study, its use of self-reported data and dichotomous exposure assessment may introduce recall bias and exposure misclassification, limiting accuracy and representativeness. Conclusions This global analysis demonstrates the substantial under-five mortality risk from cyclones, emphasizing the importance of targeted strategies to enhance community resilience against the growing threat of EWEs on children, such as improving access to water sources and sanitation facilities. © 2025 Guo et al.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the 6 February 2023 Kahramanmaraş-centered earthquakes on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by analyzing pre–post changes in HbA1c and fasting glucose. In addition, it sought to identify key clinical and biochemical predictors of glycemic worsening in the post-disaster period using routinely available laboratory data. Materials and Methods: This retrospective pre–post observational cohort study included 550 adult patients with established T2DM who received care at two centers in Gaziantep, Türkiye. Laboratory data—including HbA1c, fasting glucose, triglycerides, HDL, and albumin—were compared between two periods: three months before and three to five months after the earthquake. Paired samples t-tests, Spearman’s correlation, multiple linear regression, and ROC analysis were used to evaluate changes in glycemic control and its predictors. Results: The mean age of the participants was 56.2 ± 11.0 years; 43.3% were male and 56.7% female. Post-earthquake, HbA1c (p = 0.012) and fasting glucose (p < 0.001) increased significantly, indicating deterioration in metabolic control. White blood cell (p = 0.003) and platelet counts (p < 0.001) rose, while HDL (p < 0.001), ALT (p = 0.002), and triglycerides (p = 0.010) decreased. ΔHbA1c correlated positively with ΔGlucose (r = 0.362, p < 0.001), ΔTriglyceride (r = 0.323, p < 0.001), LDL (r = 0.173, p < 0.001), and total cholesterol (r = 0.107, p = 0.032), and negatively with ΔAlbumin (r = −0.332, p = 0.029), ΔHDL (r = −0.175, p < 0.001), and WBC (r = −0.112, p = 0.009). In the fully adjusted multivariable model (age, sex, BMI, diabetes duration, insulin use), independent predictors of ΔHbA1c included ΔGlucose (β = 0.007, p < 0.001), ΔTriglyceride (β = 0.004, p = 0.001), ΔHDL (β = −0.010, p = 0.011), ΔAlbumin (β = −0.016, p = 0.007), and ΔWBC (β = −0.009, p = 0.022). Clinical predictors were BMI (β = 0.006, p = 0.045), diabetes duration >10 years (β = 0.094, p = 0.009), and insulin use (β = 0.121, p = 0.003) (Adjusted R2 = 0.319). ROC analysis confirmed ΔGlucose as the strongest predictor of worsening glycemic control (AUC = 0.81; sensitivity 82.1%, specificity 73.4%). Additional predictors included insulin use (AUC = 0.66, p < 0.001), ΔTriglyceride (AUC = 0.65, p < 0.001), BMI (AUC = 0.63, p = 0.002), diabetes duration >10 years (AUC = 0.62, p = 0.004), and ΔHDL (AUC = 0.61, p = 0.016), each providing more modest predictive value. Conclusions: Glycemic control became significantly worse in adults with T2DM after the February 2023 earthquake, as reflected by increases in HbA1c and fasting glucose. Both biochemical parameters (Glucose, Triglyceride, HDL, Albumin, WBC) and clinical characteristics (BMI, diabetes duration >10 years, insulin use) were independently associated with glycemic deterioration. Among these, glucose remained the strongest predictor (AUC = 0.81), while BMI, insulin therapy, and longer diabetes duration provided additional predictive value. These findings suggest that routinely available clinical and laboratory data can be used to identify patients at highest risk of metabolic decompensation in disaster settings. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Natural disasters have generally been associated with an increase in adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth (PTB) and low birthweight (LBW) – two key markers of infant health that are predictive of infant mortality and life-long medical disabilities. However, there is considerable inconsistency between studies which makes it difficult to inform policy on pregnancy during and after natural disasters. In this study, we identify risk factors for pregnant women by undertaking the first meta-analysis on this topic, synthesising data from 42 studies with over 24 million participants. We also perform sub-group analysis on disaster type, a country's economic development, and trimester of exposure, addressing associations that can often not be examined in single studies. We found natural disasters to be associated with increased odds of both LBW (OR = 1.063) and PTB (OR = 1.075), with the largest effects seen from exposure in low Human Development Index countries (LBW: OR = 1.130; PTB: OR = 1.315), in first trimester (LBW: OR = 1.079; PTB: OR = 1.153), and following earthquake exposure for PTB (OR = 1.154). Our findings highlight the importance of directing disaster recovery efforts towards these vulnerable groups, to minimise the impacts on infant health following natural disasters. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Algal blooms have been linked to adverse human health, but little is known about early life exposures. This ecologic study leveraged the 2016–2018 ‘red tide’ blooms to investigate effects on birth outcomes among Florida Gulf coast residents. We estimated K. brevis concentrations and prevailing wind directions from June through October annually. We spatiotemporally linked these data with monthly counts of preterm, term low birthweight, and total live births to residents of coastal census tracts. Tract residents were considered ‘exposed’ when K. brevis in local waters exceeded various thresholds and winds blew onshore. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design, we compared preterm birth and term low birthweight birth rates pre- and post-exposure under different latency scenarios. Among 200 coastal tracts, 85 % neighbored waters where K. brevis exceeded 10,000 cells/L. Elevated K. brevis with onshore winds was associated with a concurrent decrease of 9.52 (95 % CI: 14.70, −4.70) preterm births per 100 live births, though lagged associations were statistically insignificant. Models of term low birthweight, which generally showed null associations for K. brevis elevations, had parallel trends violations, such that the results should be interpreted with caution. Since red tides occur in the warm season and high temperatures can increase the risk of preterm birth, it is possible that bloom-related odors and respiratory irritation prompted pregnant residents to stay indoors, avoiding the heat and potentially explaining the observed protective effect. However, the lack of individual-level, spatiotemporally-refined exposure measurements likely introduced misclassification. Future work should focus on improving exposure assessment methods and controlling for confounding by weather to clarify health risks from red tide exposures during pregnancy. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - The Fréchet distribution is a fundamental tool in extreme value theory, with applications spanning various fields such as life testing, modeling extreme health-related events (such as infant birth weight extremes or rare disease outbreaks), natural disasters, and environmental sciences. Despite its widespread use, existing parameter estimation methods for the Fréchet distribution face significant limitations, including computational inefficiency, instability with large datasets, and restrictions on the parameter space. To address these challenges, we propose an asymptotically efficient, closed-form estimator for the Fréchet distribution. Our estimator overcomes the limitations of existing methods, providing computational speed, stability, and high estimation quality across both small and large samples. Simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to alternative approaches. Its practical utility is illustrated through its application to the National Center for Health Statistics birth dataset. To further support its adoption, an R package has been developed to enable seamless integration of the method into diverse research applications. © Korean Statistical Society 2025.

AB  - Background: Universal prenatal screening for cytomegalovirus is not currently recommended in the United States, as no effective interventions have previously been available. With growing evidence that treating maternal first trimester primary cytomegalovirus infections with valacyclovir reduces vertical transmission, universal screening may become an important tool in congenital cytomegalovirus prevention. Objective: This study examined the cost-effectiveness of a universal screening approach for maternal cytomegalovirus in the first trimester of pregnancy followed by valacyclovir treatment in positive cases for prevention of the sequelae of congenital cytomegalovirus. Study Design: A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare outcomes of universal screening and subsequent valacyclovir treatment in a theoretical cohort of 2,869,141 individuals, the estimated number of pregnant people in the United States who receive prenatal care by the first trimester. Individuals found to be immunoglobulin G positive, immunoglobulin M positive, and to have low immunoglobulin G avidity were considered to have primary cytomegalovirus infection and received valacyclovir. Outcomes included cases of vertical cytomegalovirus transmission, abortions, stillbirths, neonatal deaths, cases of hearing loss, cases of neurodevelopmental disabilities, costs, and quality-adjusted life years. Model inputs were derived from literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed via tornado analysis, univariable sensitivity analysis, and multivariable sensitivity analysis with Monte Carlo simulation. Results: In our study, universal screening in the first trimester for primary cytomegalovirus and subsequent treatment with valacyclovir in positive cases decreased adverse outcomes by preventing 2898 vertical transmissions, 94 abortions, 19 stillbirths, 11 neonatal deaths, 460 cases of hearing loss, and 263 cases of neurodevelopmental disability. Universal screening and subsequent treatment was the dominant strategy as it saved 242.2 million dollars and led to 3437 additional quality-adjusted life years. Tornado analysis demonstrated that there were no threshold values which would change the model results, when all variables were varied across a predetermined range. Univariable sensitivity analyses demonstrated that even with decreasing specificity of screening tests, decreasing maternal utility of neonatal hearing loss, and increasing the price of screening up to 17 times the current cost, universal screening remained the cost-effective strategy. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrated that the screening strategy remained cost-saving in 100% of trials. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that screening for first trimester primary cytomegalovirus may be a cost-saving intervention, as identification of cases allows for the provision of treatment, which in turn reduces vertical cytomegalovirus transmission and costly sequelae. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Many women are occupationally active during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between exposure to chemicals during pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes or preeclampsia. The cohort included singleton births in Sweden between 1994 and 2014. The cohort was limited to low-educated mothers to reduce potential confounding from unidentified life-style associated factors. Information on occupation (full-time employed) at beginning of pregnancy, demographic data, education, personal risk factors and medical diagnoses were obtained from national records. Occupational exposure to 20 chemicals/particles was assessed by a time-specific job exposure matrix (SweJEM). Relative risks (RR) were adjusted for birth year of the child and mother's age, parity, country of birth, smoking, BMI, and occupational exposure to physical strain, low decision authority, noise, and whole-body vibrations. There were 307,985 births in the cohort. The risk of preeclampsia was elevated after exposure to diesel engine exhaust (RR 1.19; 95 % CI 1.03–1.37), gasoline engine exhaust (RR 1.26; 1.05–1.52) or to carbon monoxide (RR 1.21; 1.03–1.42). Exposure to lead was associated with an elevated risk of gestational diabetes, (RR 2.41; 1.05–5.55), based on six cases only, though. An elevated risk of preeclampsia in association with combustion products is corroborated by studies of traffic-related urban air pollution and of smoke from wildfires. Exposure to motor exhaust during pregnancy should be minimised. Exposure to lead during pregnancy should be avoided also because of serious neurodevelopmental effects for the child. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change affects the health of people mostly negatively. Vulnerability to climate change-driven health risks potentially affects all people in all countries, but differentially. The negative effects are especially pronounced for lower socio-economic status and marginalized populations in lower and middle-income countries (L&MICs). Among different population groups, pregnant women are particularly vulnerable because climate change risk exposures during pregnancy can worsen health outcomes for mother-infant dyads. Climate change may exacerbate adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth and low birthweight, two of the leading causes of under-5 mortality. This review of reviews (ROR) aims to summarize evidence from existing reviews on the impact of climate change-related exposures on low birthweight and preterm birth. In doing so, the proposed overview will identify: What climate change-related exposures are associated with decreased birthweight and preterm birth and characterize their magnitude. Overall, answering these questions will help identify possible risk mitigation options for the future. We used the preferred reporting items for overviews of reviews (PRIOR) guidelines to develop this protocol. We searched five (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Global Health, and Scopus) databases to identify relevant systematic review articles that assessed the relationship between climate change-related (temperature, heat, heat exposure, precipitation, air pollutants, fires, natural weather disasters) and low birthweight (LBW), birthweight in grams, or preterm birth as the outcome. Each systematic review will be independently screened, and only English language reviews will be included, due to the study team's linguistic limitations. Two independent researchers will screen abstracts, conduct full-text reviews, and extract data. Based on our scoping exercise, we expect to have around 12 reviews included in this ROR. A third researcher will reconsider any discrepancies. Literature screening will be conducted using Rayyan software and data will be extracted into an Excel file. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune syndrome that often clinically manifests as venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity, and thrombocytopenia. While APS is rare and difficult to diagnose, it can lead to devastating complications, most notably catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). Both APS and CAPS have a strong association with pregnancy, which is often what reveals a new diagnosis of APS. Recurrent spontaneous abortions and pre-eclampsia are the most common pregnancy-related triggers for APS, while Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, Low Platelets (HELLP) syndrome is less common but more dangerous to the patient's health. Case Report: This case report identifies a 23-year-old female who presented to the emergency department (ED) 1-week postpartum with significant abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting. The report details an uncommon and life-threatening postpartum condition that was a result of a yet to be diagnosed autoimmune condition. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: APS is potentially life threatening, particularly when the patient's clinical course is complicated by CAPS, but it is difficult to diagnose. This case report reveals 4 clinical clues found in the ED that pointed toward a new diagnosis of APS and impending CAPS. If a new diagnosis of APS is suspected or a patient with known APS is possibly presenting with CAPS, the emergency physician must be able to consider these diagnoses and appropriately begin therapeutic interventions. If possible, these interventions should be done in close consultation with the admitting team, particularly the intensive care unit and hematology. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Disasters are events that occur suddenly in nature and cause people to suffer economic and social losses. In addition to the problems migrant and refugee women face due to migration, they become even more vulnerable to disasters and suffer disproportionately from disasters. In disasters, the local and social proximity of midwives to the communities they serve has an important potential to prevent maternal mortality. To provide care to migrant and refugee women in disasters, it is vital to develop and implement a disaster-specific care model for these women. In the literature, it is stated that when intervening with migrant and refugee women experiencing disasters, the health professional should recognize the current disease history, community backgrounds and family roles, cultural difference is an obstacle to access to health care, and women are more vulnerable than men. While even non-migrant women have difficulty accessing pregnancy and childbirth services in disaster situations, it is critical that refugee and migrant women at risk have access to these services. Midwives, as health professionals providing primary care to women, have the responsibility of being the first authorized persons to reach women in times of disaster. In this review, it is aimed to propose the development of a midwifery care model for migrant and refugee women in disasters because of Leininger Cultural Care Model, Selye Stress Theory, Roy Adaptation Model. © 2025, Ankara University.

AB  - Worster-Drought syndrome (WDS), or congenital suprabulbar paresis, is characterised by congenital dysarthria, dysphagia and other pseudobulbar paresis without structural abnormalities around the Sylvian fissure on imaging. This rare syndrome is challenging to diagnose, particularly in preterm infants. This report describes a low-birth-weight female infant with WDS who had no sucking reflex from birth, airway obstruction due to saliva retention and muscle rigidity, who was diagnosed with the syndrome at a postconceptional age (PCA) of 1 month. She was discharged with only home oxygen therapy as respiratory support at a PCA of 3 months after gradual improvement in her clinical symptoms. Diagnosis of WDS is difficult in the early postnatal period in preterm cases owing to prematurity but should be suspected when bulbar palsy, including absence of the sucking reflex, persistent dysphagia and obstructed breathing, persists beyond a PCA of 40 weeks and when muscle stiffness is present. © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2025.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 3, particularly in developing countries, exacerbating existing health disparities and creating new challenges for health systems worldwide. This study explores the role of university research in advancing SDG 3 targets in a post-pandemic context using the University of the Western Cape as a case study. Through qualitative data analysis of research titles and abstracts registered between 2020 and 2022, we applied the WHERETO model of McTighe and Bloom’s Taxonomy to categorize research according to the SDG 3 targets and indicators. This approach provides insight into which health priorities were addressed through scholarly research at UWC in alignment with the UN 2030 Agenda, particularly during pandemic recovery. Our findings indicate that research priorities largely corresponded with South Africa’s health challenges, with the highest concentration of studies addressing non-communicable diseases and mental health (Target 3.4), infectious diseases (Target 3.3), and medicine development (Target 3.b). These priorities align with the National Health Research Committee’s identified health priorities for disadvantaged communities in the Western Cape. Notably, research on mental health and emergency preparedness (Target 3.d) increased significantly during the pandemic period, reflecting shifting priorities in response to COVID-19. This study offers critical insights into how university research shifted priorities adapted during the pandemic and identifies areas requiring focused attention to support post-pandemic recovery. By highlighting research gaps and opportunities, our findings provide a foundation for developing more comprehensive approaches to health research that address the disparities exacerbated by COVID-19 while advancing the 2030 agenda. This model could inform research prioritization at other institutions facing similar challenges in both local and global contexts. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Japan's maternal mortality rate and perinatal mortality rate have shown one of the world's most significant declines, positioning Japan at the global forefront of the lowest levels. The nearly logarithmic annual decline in maternal and perinatal mortality rates suggests that, in addition to advances in medicine and healthcare, various types of care for mothers and newborns have played a crucial role in this achievement. Method: From the period of World War II to the postwar era, up to around 1980, and then every decade thereafter, the events and movements surrounding perinatal healthcare in each era were examined from the perspectives of epidemiology, medical/healthcare advancements, and institutional/policy trends. Results: The major events in each era are outlined as follows: Until around 1980: After World War II, in 1948, several laws were enacted to protect mothers and fetuses, including the Maternal and Child Health Handbook, in 1966. The number of births experienced a baby boom for about 10 years following 1945, peaking in 1973. Birthplaces shifted from home deliveries to medical facilities, with doctors becoming the primary birth attendants. Academically, the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (JAOG) for Maternal Protection and the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG) were established in 1949. In the medical field, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) were introduced and neonatal transport systems became well-established by the 1970s. In 1976, the limit of viability was revised from under 28 weeks of gestation to under 24 weeks. The late 1970s saw the fetal heart rate monitoring, the heartbeat detection using Doppler ultrasound and the ultrasound imaging techniques. 1980s: The perinatal medicine became well established, leading to hold The Japan Society of Perinatal Medicine. For fetal management, the fields of fetal diagnosis and fetal treatment entered their early stages with the widespread use of fetal heart rate monitoring and ultrasound imaging. In neonatal care, neonatal transport systems to NICU facilities were enhanced. A major breakthrough in this field was the discovery and widespread use of pulmonary surfactant. Two key concepts that emerged and advanced during this period were maternal transport systems and the Perinatal Maternal and Child Center initiative. In 1987, cases of hepatitis caused by non-heat-treated coagulation products became a major issue. As a result, informed consent affecting mothers and fetuses became a significant point of discussion. The Obstetrics and Gynecology Specialist system was introduced, along with the regular publication of Training Notes for Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Glossary of Obstetrics and Gynecology Terms. As a result of these efforts, both the perinatal mortality rate and the maternal mortality rate were reduced by approximately half over the course of 10 years. 1990s: In 1991, the limit of viability was revised to 22 weeks of gestation. In terms of maternal care, nutritional management guidelines for general pregnant women were introduced. In fetal medicine, major topics included the administration of steroids to the mother to promote fetal lung maturation, as well as direct fetal treatments such as shunt procedures and needle aspirations. In neonatal care, inhaled nitric oxide therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment became more widely adopted. Following the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, in 1995, led to the development of the Disaster Medical Assistance Team and the establishment of Perinatal Maternal and Child Medical Center. In 1996, the Maternal Protection Law was enacted, and the Japan Council for Quality Health Care (JCQHC) was founded to standardize medical care. Asia & Oceania Federation of Obstetrics & Gynecology Journal and Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology Research were launched as English-language academic journals. 2000s: Japan's perinatal mortality rate became the lowest in the world, but the maternal mortality rate was still struggling. Obstetric care changed significantly after an obstetrician was arrested for causing a maternal death during a cesarean section. The JSOG and the JAOG developed practice guidelines describing standard obstetric diagnosis and treatments, and the JCQHC established the Japan Obstetric Compensation System for Cerebral Palsy. In addition, a project to report on maternal deaths by JAOG was also launched, and the combination of these measures led to form a framework of professional autonomy for obstetricians. During this period, brain hypothermic therapy for brain injury was developed. 2010s: The Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 led to major changes in disaster medical planning. This included the introduction of training programs for disaster medical coordinators and the development of disaster-time pediatric and perinatal liaisons. To enhance medical safety, JAOG launched an incidental case reporting system in 2004. Additionally, in 2010, a maternal mortality reporting system was introduced, followed by the maternal severe complications reporting system in 2021. The Japan Council for Implementation of Maternal Emergency Life-Saving System was established, along with the Japan Association for Labor Analgesia, a collaborative council for academic societies and organizations related to painless delivery. Suicide as a significant cause of maternal death led to the establishment of the “Mother and Child Mental Forum” academic conference, which later evolved into the Mental Health Care for Mother & Child training program. In the field of prenatal testing, non-invasive prenatal testing was introduced as a clinical research initiative. From 2020 onward: The year 2020 began with the global outbreak of COVID-19. Until 2023, numerous issues arose due to repeated pandemics, including delivery methods and locations for COVID-positive pregnant women, standard precautions during labor, mother-infant separation after birth, vaccination, so on. JSOG and JAOG worked together to address these challenges. The most pressing issue in the perinatal field is the declining birth rate. Alongside an aging workforce of physicians and a shortage of successors, the decrease in new obstetric clinic openings has become a major concern. By 2024, the decrease in the number of full-time obstetricians and the overtime work limits in Medical Care Act are making it necessary to reconsider the structure of obstetric medical services. Japan's perinatal care system, which has maintained the highest global standards, now stands at a major crossroads. Conclusion: Researchers (clinicians), academic societies, and professional organizations, centered on the mother and child, have collaborated with support from the government, making progress and building the current safe pregnancy and childbirth management system. However, significant issues remain that need urgent attention, including regulations on overtime work, securing obstetrician numbers, the rapid decline in childbirth facilities, and the functional collapse of perinatal maternal-child healthcare centers. These are critical challenges that must be addressed promptly. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - A recent study examined trends in perinatal mortality (PM) in Ukraine for possible increases following the Chernobyl accident. PM rates from Belarus and other countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU) are analyzed here using essentially the same methods. Data and methods Perinatal mortality data for the FSU countries are available in the Health for All database (WHO). In this study, data from Ukraine, Belarus, the Russian Federation, Moldova, and Estonia are analyzed. The regression model uses a long-term exponential trend with flexible time dependence and two superimposed bell-shaped terms (Model 1). In a second approach, the bell-shaped excess terms are replaced by the inverse of gross domestic product per capita (the GDP term), which serves as a proxy for the possible impact of the socio-economic crisis after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The possible strontium exposure of pregnant women (the strontium term) is added as a second covariate (Model 2). Results Model 1 fitted the data of all five countries well. The observed increases in PM rates in the 1990s were greater in Belarus than in Ukraine and Russia. Model 2 regressions also fit the data well, except for Ukraine. In Belarus, Russia, and Moldova, the GDP term alone explained the deviation of PM rates from the predicted trend; adding the strontium term did not significantly improve the fit. Only in Ukraine and Estonia was the effect of the strontium term statistically significant. In 1987, increases in PM were found in all countries except Estonia, where PM peaked in 1988. Conclusion The deviation of PM rates in the 1990s from the long-term trend is related to GDP per capita. An effect of the strontium term is detected only in Ukraine and Estonia, where sharp increases in PM were observed in the early 1990s, well before the trough of GDP in the second half of the 1990s. © 2025 Alfred Körblein.

AB  - We investigated associations between preconception and prenatal heat stress and wildfire (WF) smoke exposures on adverse birth outcomes and whether neighborhood climate vulnerability is an effect modifier in the Maternal And Developmental Risks from Environmental and Social stressors cohort (N = 713). Generalized linear models were fit to test the association between exposures and small-for-gestational-age (SGA), low birthweight (LBW), and Fenton growth z-score outcomes, adjusting for confounders. Living in a high climate vulnerability index neighborhood was tested as an effect modifier. During preconception, increases in heat stress and WF measures were associated with higher odds of SGA. Living in the most climate-vulnerable neighborhoods during preconception significantly modified and nearly doubled the odds of SGA with exposure to heat stress. Similarly, heat stress and WF exposure in trimester-specific time periods were associated with adverse birth outcomes. Conversely, third-trimester exposures were associated with lower odds of LBW. Throughout pregnancy, two measures of infant size (SGA and Fenton z-scores) were lower among those with greater exposure to multiple WF exposures. This study highlights how living in more climate-vulnerable neighborhoods significantly modifies the effect of heat stress on SGA, suggesting that the increasing adaptation capacity of communities may strengthen climate change resilience. © 2025 The Authors.

AB  - The flood exposure in India exacerbates childhood malnutrition, particularly in the vulnerable regions of India. Presently, India is facing a dual burden of natural disasters and malnutrition, especially in the vulnerable regions that are exposed to floods. Many studies have been focused on micro-level or regional-level analyses. The present study is uniquely examining the association between flood exposure and malnutrition at a national scale. The study investigated the impacts of flood exposure on childhood malnutrition, using the Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure (CIAF) to assess stunting, wasting, and underweight among children under five years age group. The present study is based on the analyses of data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5, 2019–2021) and Central Water Commission (CWC) reports. The data were analyzed across flood-affected regions in India and categorized by the frequency of flood events (i.e., non-flooded; 1–2 times flooded; and three times flooded events). The analysis reveals a significant increase in malnutrition rates with higher flood exposure in regions experiencing three flood events, 38 percent of children were stunted, 20 percent were wasted, and 35.7 percent were underweight as compared to non-flooded areas. Factors such as low birth weight, maternal education, sanitation facilities, and household infrastructure intensified malnutrition outcomes. The major findings of the study suggested that repeated flooding events aggravate food insecurity and increase vulnerability to child malnutrition. This study not only highlights the compounded effects of flood exposure and socio-economic disparities on CIAF malnutrition but also offers policy-relevant insights. The results of the study highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions, including developing disaster-resilient infrastructure, educational programs for mothers, and enhanced access to sanitation and healthcare in flood-affected regions in India. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Teratology, the study of congenital anomalies caused by environmental, chemical, and biological factors, derives from the Greek "teratos," meaning monster, reflecting historical intrigue with birth defects. While the field is relatively modern, curiosity about anomalies spans millennia, as seen in ancient art and mythology. Over time, societal views shifted from curiosity to fear, recognizing birth defects as potential social, economic, and spiritual burdens. The 20th century brought pivotal advances. Discoveries such as the rubella-birth defect link, ionizing radiation effects, and the thalidomide disaster reshaped understanding and regulations. Wilson's "Six Principles of Teratology" established guidelines for how teratogens impact development, focusing on timing, dose-response relationships, and genetic susceptibility. Despite progress, birth defects still affect millions worldwide, underscoring the importance of education and counseling on teratogenic risks. Resources like TERIS, Reprotox, and MotherToBaby now provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based guidance, aiding informed decision-making and improving pregnancy outcomes. The ever-evolving field of teratology emphasizes the need for ongoing research and effective communication to manage and prevent birth defects. © 2025

AB  - Background: Pregnant people and infants are vulnerable to wildfire smoke. However, the availability of perinatal resources in communities impacted by smoke is unknown. Objective: Describe perinatal resources in counties prone to wildfire smoke. Research Study Design: Smoke data came from the Hazard Mapping System and perinatal resources were gathered from various sources. Choropleth maps described the geographic distribution of smoke. Unadjusted associations and multivariable regressions compared perinatal resource levels by smoke risk. Subgroup analysis of the most rural counties was conducted. Subjects: Counties in the contiguous United States (n = 3108) during the 2016–2020 period. Measures: Relative smoke risk was defined as the bottom, middle, and top third of the average annual smoke-days distribution. Perinatal resources included driving distance to the nearest maternity care hospital and NICU, the volume and geographic isolation of the nearest maternity care hospital, and county-based measures of OB-GYN and family medicine physicians. Results: Average annual smoke-days ranged from 3.8 (SD = 2.0) in low-risk to 15.3 (SD = 5.5) in high-risk counties. Compared with low-risk counties, high-risk counties had fewer OB-GYNs per 10,000 births (-32.2, 95% CI: -45.7 to -20.6; P < 0.001) and were farther to the nearest maternity hospital (10.1 miles, 95% CI: 8.7–11.5; P < 0.001). High-risk counties were also farther to the nearest NICU. Associations were not explained by sociodemographics and were observed in the subset of the most rural counties. Conclusions: Communities prone to wildfire smoke often lack geographic access to the health care resources needed to treat pregnant people and infants in a timely manner. © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century and has far-reaching effects on human health. Pregnant women and their unborn children are among the particularly vulnerable groups. Studies worldwide show that environmental factors such as extreme heat, air pollution and natural disasters increase the risk of premature births, low birth weight and pregnancy complications. Heat-related complications during pregnancy also include premature rupture of the membranes, stillbirths, fetal anomalies, gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. It is essential that physicians, midwives and healthcare professionals are well informed and can provide their pregnant patients with comprehensive information about risks and preventive measures. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Tropical cyclones (TCs) pose substantial health risks to infants, particularly those living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the extent to which TCs affect infant survival in LMICs is not well understood. We examined the impact of TC exposure on infant mortality by linking recently developed TC wind field data with 1,682,249 nationally representative infant survival records from 2002 to 2021 across seven LMICs. We found that, on average, exposure to TCs in utero or in the first year of life led to 4.4 additional infant deaths per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 8.4; 11% increase compared to the sample average infant mortality rate). This average effect was mainly driven by excess mortality in Bangladesh, Dominican Republic, and Haiti, with small and statistically insignificant effects in all other study countries. Further investigation is warranted to understand the mechanisms through which TCs affect infant mortality and why some countries’ children fare better after TC exposure than others. © © 2025 The Authors, some rights reserved.

AB  - With an increasing aging population and Alzheimer’s disease tsunami, it is critical to identify early antecedents of brain aging to target for intervention and prevention. Women and men develop and age differently, thus using a sex differences lens can contribute to identification of early risk biomarkers and resilience. There is growing evidence for fetal antecedents to adult memory impairments, potentially through disruption of maternal prenatal immune pathways. Here, we hypothesized that in utero exposure to maternal pro-inflammatory cytokines will have sex-dependent effects on specific brain circuitry regulating offspring’s memory and immune function that will be retained across the lifespan. Using a unique prenatal cohort, we tested this in 204 adult offspring, equally divided by sex, who were exposed/unexposed to an adverse in utero maternal immune environment and followed into early midlife (~age 50). Functional magnetic resonance imaging results showed exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines in utero (i.e., higher maternal IL-6 and TNF-α levels) was significantly associated with sex differences in brain activity and connectivity underlying memory circuitry and performance and with a hyperimmune state, 50 years later. In contrast, the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 alone, was not significantly associated with memory circuitry in midlife. Predictive validity of prenatal exposure was underscored by significant associations with age 7 academic achievement, also associated with age 50 memory performance. Results uniquely demonstrated that adverse levels of maternal in utero pro-inflammatory cytokines during a critical period of the sexual differentiation of the brain produced long-lasting effects on immune function and memory circuitry/function from childhood to midlife that were sex-dependent, brain region-specific, and, within women, reproductive stage-dependent. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Public health measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally altered the socioecological context in which children were developing. Methods: Using Bronfenbrenner’s socioecological theory, we investigate language acquisition among 2-year-old children (n = 4037) born during the pandemic. We focus on “late talkers”, defined as children below the 10th percentile on the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories-III. Results: Overall, the proportion of late talkers declined as a function of pandemic wave, with 13.0% of those born during the first wave classified as late talkers compared to 10.4% born in wave two, and 8.0% born during wave three. In sex-based analysis, we observed a 15.9% prevalence of late talking among female toddlers, which was significantly different from the norming sample. In contrast, the prevalence of late talking among male toddlers was 9.1%. Using hierarchical logistic regression to identify both proximal and distal factors associated with being a late talker, we found that male sex, lower socioeconomic status, greater screen time, receiving childcare at home, disruptions to childcare, and experiencing greater exposure to public health restrictions were associated with increased odds for being a late talker. Conclusion: We interpret the findings in relation to the need to consider the special needs of young children in disaster preparation and response. Impact: Two-year-old children acquiring language in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have vocabulary size similar to historical norms. A higher-than-expected prevalence of late talkers (below the 10th percentile) was observed among females and children born during the first wave of the pandemic. Motivated by Bronfenbrenner’s socioecological theory, we show that both proximal and distal environmental factors are associated with vocabulary size.

AB  - On 4 June 1629, the Batavia was wrecked at the Houtman Abrolhos. After the shipwreck, more than 100 survivors were murdered. The senior merchant Francisco Pelsaert prosecuted the murderers and presented evidence that the murders were planned before the shipwreck. In this article, the trial against the murderers is re-examined using a scenario approach, which provides a framework for rational thinking about evidence and proof in a criminal case. Based on insights from this approach and findings on the impact of waterboarding, the reader learns that another scenario provides a better explanation for what happened. In that scenario, there was no premeditated mutiny. Instead, famine and water scarcity served as catalysts for mass murder. The collapse of existing forms of authority and social organization allowed a group of survivors to seize power and start a massacre. In the final section of the article, the potential of the scenario approach for analysing historical trial records is discussed. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) occurs following spontaneous labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes. It accounts for up to 70%of all preterm births (PTBs) and can result from infection or inflammation, decidual hemorrhage, uterine over distention, and chronic or acute stress. Exposure to fine particular matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and its components is associated with similar pathways, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Ambient PM<inf>2.5</inf> has been identified as a leading environmental risk factor for adverse health outcomes. Studies have found an association between PM<inf>2.5</inf> and sPTB. Additionally, exposure to green spaces has been associated with reduced health risks linked to air pollution, but this has been less studied in relation to sPTB. The aim of this study was to assess the associations of PM<inf>2.5</inf> and its constituents with sPTB and how environmental factors may modify the effect. This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study, based on singleton live births in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health care system, between 2008, and 2018. sPTBs were defined as preterm delivery after spontaneous labor, without related medical indications. All other PTBs with medical indications were classified as iatrogenic PTB. Daily total PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations and monthly concentrations of PM<inf>2.5</inf> constituents (eg, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, organic matter, and black carbon) were obtained at the level of census tract. Mean exposures to total PM<inf>2.5</inf> and its constituents were calculated for the entire pregnancy and in each trimester. Wildfire exposure, green-space exposure at the street level within a 1-km radius around an individual's residence, and daily maximum temperature also were obtained. Of the 429,839 singleton live births included in the analysis, there were 19,341 sPTBs (4.73%) and 11,254 iatrogenic PTBs (2.75%). The association for total PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposure and sPTB was statistically significant with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-1.06; P < 0.001. Associations were also observed for sulfate (aOR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.09; P < 0.001), nitrate (aOR,1.09; 95% CI, 1.06-1.13; P < 0.001), organic matter (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08; P < 0.001), and black carbon (aOR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.11-1.20; P < 0.001). Pregnancies in the second trimester had higher aORs in the association of total PM<inf>2.5</inf> and its constituents with sPTB. The odds of sPTB increased with a quartile increase in the mixture of PM<inf>2.5</inf> sulfate, nitrate, organic matter, and black carbon (aOR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06-1.13; P < 0.001). The positive association was 37.73% for black carbon, 34.34% for nitrate, and 27.93% for sulfate. Lower exposure to green spaces increased the odds of sPTB (<50th percentile: aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.15-1.23 vs =50th percentile: aOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.13; P < 0.001). The odds of sPTB associated with PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposure were higher with greater exposure to wildfire smoke (=50th percentile: aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.16-1.23 vs <50th percentile: aOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.09-1.16; P = 0.009) and extreme heat (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.42-1.59 vs mild temperature: aOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.09-1.14; P < 0.001). In conclusion, the odds of sPTB increased with greater exposure to PM<inf>2.5</inf> during pregnancy. Those exposed to higher levels of wildfire smoke and extreme heat were also at greater risk of sPTB.However, exposure to green spaces decreased the odds of sPTB. © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Background: Aid sanctions are a type of financial punishment imposed on a country by other countries or international organisations in response to a political coup, armed conflict, or human rights abuses. Humanitarian catastrophes in Burkina Faso, Sudan, and Myanmar have brought aid sanctions to the centre of the foreign affairs strategy debate because of their inadvertent negative effects on human health. Our analysis investigates the effects of aid sanctions from 1990 to 2019 on maternal and child mortality. These questions are particularly relevant in the context of the abrupt shift in US foreign aid policy in 2025, leading to aid prohibitions that might resemble aid sanctions in their effects. Methods: Data were drawn from a broad set of sources, including population health metrics databases, established sanctions databases, and a novel global dataset on aid sanctions created for this study. We assessed the prevalence of the use of aid sanctions worldwide during 1990–2019 and estimated their impact on official development assistance (ODA) and development assistance for health (DAH). We investigated the effect of aid sanctions on infant (age <1 year), children younger than 5 years (hereafter referred to as under-5), maternal (within 42 days of the end of pregnancy), and all-age mortality rates using panel difference-in-differences ordinary least squares estimation. We applied linear regression methods and included country and year fixed effects, country-specific time trends, and multiple control variables. We also conducted a series of sensitivity analyses, including entropy balancing, to confirm the validity of our results. Findings: During our study period, 67 low-income or middle-income countries (LMICs) and sovereign territories (hereafter referred to as countries) were targeted by 88 unique aid sanction episodes. Relative to our control group of 66 never-sanctioned countries, aid sanctions reduced ODA by an estimated US$213·07 million per year (95% CI 502·28 to –76·12) for the average target country and reduced DAH by $16·42 million (32·57 to 0·27)––a 17% reduction in DAH. Aid sanctions resulted in an additional 129·3 infant deaths per 100 000 livebirths (11·7 to 246·9), an additional 47·1 under-5 deaths per 100 000 livebirths (–2·8 to 97·0), and an additional 10·9 (2·2–19·6) maternal deaths per 100 000 livebirths, per year. Relative to mean in-sample mortality rates, aid sanctions thus increased infant, under-5, and maternal mortality rates by 3·1%, 3·6%, and 6·4%, respectively, on an annual basis. Interpretation: Over the period 1990–2019, infant, under-5, and maternal mortality rates among LMICs declined at average annualised rates of 2·6%, 3·2%, and 2·0%, respectively. Aid sanction episodes lasting 5 years—the median duration observed in our sample—would thus negate nearly 30% of the overall improvements in infant and under-5 mortality seen in the average LMIC over this period and approximately 60% of the improvements in maternal mortality. Our findings suggest that aid sanctions are leading to increases in child and maternal mortality via reductions to ODA and DAH and they can inadvertently compound human suffering. This research provides quantitative evidence to support growing legislative awareness of the importance of assessing health impacts while aid sanctions are imposed, and highlights the need to monitor the consequences of foreign aid policies by donor countries, such as foreign aid prohibitions and restrictions.

AB  - Background Extreme weather events, or natural disasters, present a large and increasing threat to human health, infrastructure and food security, including in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where the burden of undernutrition is high. However, research about associations between natural disasters and undernutrition in early childhood is limited. Methods We combined anthropometric data of children aged 0-59 months from 51 Demographic and Health Surveys datasets collected from 2010 to 2019 in 30 countries in SSA with information on natural disaster events (flood, drought, other) from the Emergency Events Database database to determine disaster exposure. The analytic sample included 320 479 children. We used generalised estimating equations to predict stunting, wasting and anaemia by disaster exposure and selected covariates. Results Almost 20% (19.7%) of children under five were exposed to a natural disaster in the preceding year. In adjusted analysis, children exposed to at least one disaster in the preceding year had a relative risk (RR) of wasting 1.17 times higher than unexposed children (95% CI 1.12, 1.22). Adjusted models examining exposure to drought or flood consistently estimated higher risks of wasting post-disaster (drought RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.26, 1.47; flood RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02, 1.12). RRs increased when using a 3-month exposure period. However, exposure to natural disaster was not consistently associated with significant differences in RR of stunting or anaemia. Conclusion Natural disasters are prevalent in SSA. Given the high risk of wasting associated with disaster exposure, policymakers should prioritise interventions to address wasting in post-disaster settings. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

AB  - Housing conditions are emerging as an important consideration in climate change adaptation. Housing modifications have the potential to improve health outcomes by reducing exposure to changing weather conditions and extreme events. This scoping review aimed to explore the existing evidence examining the contribution of housing conditions to the impacts of climate change on health and identify any research gaps. Literature searches were conducted in Scopus and PubMed from January 2013 to September 2023 and data were analysed using thematic analysis. The review included 38 articles consisting of original studies, reviews, and reports, with broad geographical coverage. The most common focus among included articles was on heat-health impacts; housing conditions found to improve heat-health health outcomes included air conditioning, ventilation, and window shading, and there was support for multifaceted housing adaptations rather than single fixes. Ventilation was found to be a priority for improving indoor air quality, while inappropriate insulation and excessive air tightness were found to increase indoor heat and reduce indoor air quality. The scoping review reveals a need for more empirical and qualitative research into indoor heat in homes, climate change hazards other than heat, and intervention studies to inform climate change adaptation policies around housing and improve public health outcomes. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - In February 1825, the dikes broke after a spring tide in the Krummhörn region in East Frisia, Germany, causing a severe disaster. Although the flood did not claim many victims, substantial damage was done to the farmland, and the economic crisis that followed permanently changed the social structure in the Krummhörn. We study family reconstitutions of the region linked to information about socioeconomic status, detailed reports of the flood damage, and information on crop prices for the entire study period. We innovate on the literature through our reconstruction of property damage at the parish level, as well as of the economic development in the region, combined with family reconstitutions. We investigate the short-term impact of the flood on marital fertility and child mortality, as well as the long-term impact on age at first childbirth and age at first marriage of individuals who experienced the flood early in life. We use Cox proportional hazard models to study mortality. The timing and the likelihood of transitions are investigated with the help of mixed parametric cure models. We find that child mortality, but not infant mortality, increased in the flood aftermath, but that this increase in mortality was not attributable to the flood-related damage. Furthermore, we find no evidence of changes in the timing of first childbirth or marriage among the affected individuals. These findings contrast with the results of several other studies indicating that external shocks and crisis experience early in life affect life course outcomes. © 2024

AB  - Radiation impacts living organisms in several ways, and its biological effects vary depending on the type and dose of exposure. It can damage DNA, potentially causing mutations and increasing the risk of cancer. Ionizing radiation can harm the human body through two primary mechanisms. Direct damage occurs when radiation strikes essential biological molecules, such as DNA, breaking or altering their structure. Indirect damage arises when radiation interacts with water molecules—abundant in cells—generating free radicals, which are highly reactive and can harm cellular components. These free radicals can react with DNA and other cellular components, leading to molecular damage. Depending on the radiation dose and exposure rate, the biological effects can range from minor, repairable molecular damage to cell and tissue death. These outcomes may result in acute or chronic health conditions, such as Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) and an increased risk of cancer. Additional consequences may include cardiovascular diseases and thermal effects, which can cause localized tissue overheating and damage. Radiation exposure can also suppress the immune system, thereby increasing susceptibility to infections. Negative effects on mental and physical development or birth defects may result from exposure during developmental stages, such as pregnancy. Exposure to radiation in specific situations, like nuclear accidents, can result in mental health issues like depression and anxiety. Proper precautions must be taken when handling radiation sources, as health risks generally increase with higher exposure doses. ©: ©2025 The authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Kahramanmaraş Earthquake, often referred to as the "disaster of the century," occurred on February 6, 2023. Following the 7.7 magnitude earthquake, extensive destruction and significant loss of life occurred across 10 provinces. This study aims to analyze the outcomes and share the surgical and radiologic algorithm applied to live, trauma-affected pregnant patients who were referred to the obstetrics and gynecology emergency department of our hospital following the earthquake. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study. The study included pregnant patients affected by the earthquake who were admitted to and/or referred to the obstetrics and gynecology emergency department of a tertiary hospital between February 6 and March 6, 2023. Demographic data, trauma-related findings, surgical details, and obstetric outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 58 pregnant earthquake victims were evaluated. The mean gestational age was 22.24±10.59 weeks. The most common obstetric complaint was pelvic pain or contractions (36.3%). Eleven patients gave birth, two via vaginal delivery and nine via cesarean section. The mean gestational age at delivery was 32.81 weeks. Curettage was performed in three patients, and hysterotomy in one patient. There were six live births and five stillbirths. In patients undergoing cesarean section, a midline incision was made. After delivery, the uterus was sutured, and intra-abdominal organs were evaluated. In cases of pelvic or other fractures, intraoperative scope devices were used. When necessary, patients were consulted by general surgery and orthopedics departments and were transferred to either the ward or the intensive care unit, depending on their clinical condition. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound has become the primary diagnostic tool for emergency evaluation in pregnant women. For earthquake victims who lack access to radiological assessment and require rapid clinical decisions, the recommended surgical approaches, particularly midline incisions, and intraoperative evaluations (such as the use of intraoperative scope after delivery) can be life-saving for both the baby and the mother. © 2025, Turkish Association of Trauma and Emergency Surgery.

AB  - Biomass combustion, including wildfires and residential wood burning, is a significant source of particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) in Australia, with potentially distinct health effects due to its unique chemical composition. This study aimed to quantify the association between exposure to ambient biomass-attributable PM<inf>2.5</inf> and the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth across pregnancy windows in Sydney, Australia, from 2010 to 2020. We conducted case–control studies nested within a cohort of 578,391 singleton pregnancies, including 29,954 preterm births and 2,928 stillbirths. Controls were randomly selected using risk-set sampling. Daily all-source PM<inf>2.5</inf> estimates at a 5 km resolution were obtained from a previous study. Days exceeding the 95th percentile of all-source PM<inf>2.5</inf> at statistical area level 4 without significant dust storm pollution were classified as biomass-affected days. For these days, biomass-attributable PM<inf>2.5</inf> was estimated using the remainder component from a seasonal trend decomposition, with the seasonal and trend components representing nonbiomass-attributable PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Conditional logistic regressions were used to analyze associations between biomass-attributable PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposure and outcomes, adjusting for area-level socioeconomic factors, temperature, humidity, and temporal and seasonal trends. The odds ratio for preterm birth per interquartile range increase in biomass-attributable PM<inf>2.5</inf> was 1.002 (95% CI = 0.997, 1.007) for the entire pregnancy average exposure, with similar null results across trimesters. For stillbirth, the odds ratio was 1.002 (95% CI = 0.985, 1.019) for the entire pregnancy average exposure, with comparable null findings across trimesters. These results suggest that in Sydney, biomass-attributable PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposure during pregnancy may not increase the risk of preterm births or stillbirths. © © 2025 The Authors.

AB  - The November 2018 Camp fire was the most destructive wildfire in California history, but its effects on reproductive health are not known. We linked California birth records from 2017-2019 to daily smoke levels using US EPA Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 data and NOAA Hazard Mapping System smoke plume polygons during the Camp fire. In the main analysis, pregnancies were considered exposed if they had median AQS PM2.5 levels above 50 μg/m3 for at least 7 days during November 8-22, 2018. We calculated rates of preterm birth and the infant sex ratio based on week of conception and used the generalized synthetic control method to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated and to propose a novel approach to identify potential critical weeks of exposure during pregnancy. We found associations between Camp fire-related smoke exposure and rates of preterm birth, with a risk difference (RD) of 0.005 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.001-0.010. Exposure during week 10 of pregnancy was consistently associated with increased preterm birth (RD, 0.030; 95% CI, 0.004-0.056). We did not observe differences in the infant sex ratio. Camp fire smoke exposure was associated with increased rates of preterm birth, with sensitive windows in the first trimester. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Dams are essential for flood protection, water resources management, energy generation and storage and food production. However, the consequences of their failure can be catastrophic, as demonstrated by recent examples. Here this study revisits dam failures worldwide since 1900, analysing key factors driving the failure risk, profiling current dam safety and providing an outlook to the near future. Similar to previous analyses (1970s to 2010s), we observe a strong infant mortality, which remains especially important for the development of new embankment dams, while recent concrete dams have become more resilient. In contrast, hazard signals related to ageing remain yet less apparent, contrary to common belief. Nevertheless, given their abundance, we expect decades-old dams to be prevalent in future failure statistics—especially for embankment dams of height between 15 and 70 m built in the second half of the last century. This highlights the relevance of investments in monitoring, maintenance and uprating, which, if ignored, could become a substantial liability and a major vulnerability, especially in the context of increased flooding frequency. We uncover a trend of increased failure rates of newly constructed dams in low-income regions, which coincides with areas where a substantial hydropower potential remains untapped. This is especially intensified in monsoon-dominated climates, whereas the pattern of construction and failures is more homogeneous across other major climatic regions. Our statistical analysis suggests that 23 (95% confidence interval 14–33) large dam failures are to be expected worldwide in the near future (2023–2035), with currently ~4.4% of large dams having a probability of failure larger than 1/10,000. Contrarily, 85% of large dams are at least twice as safe as this threshold, commonly embraced in policy. These findings can support the targeted allocation of limited resources for the future-proofing of infrastructure, thereby contributing to water, food and energy security. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Migration, driven by factors like poverty, violence, and natural disasters, is a key social determinant of health. While international migrants often have worse perinatal outcomes, research on perinatal health differences between internal migrants and non-migrants remains limited. We aimed to determine whether the offspring of women who migrate within Brazil experience poorer perinatal outcomes than those of non-migrants, according to the Human Development Index (HDI) of their municipalities of origin and destination. Methods: We used the CIDACS Birth Cohort, consisting of women applying for social programmes in the Unified Registry for Social Programmes Cadastro Único linked with live births and mortality registries. We included live births conceived from March 2010 to February 2018. Internal migrants were women who changed their state of residence from registration in CadUnico to the birth of the child. We derived risk ratios (RR) of migration's effect according to HDI of residence before and after migration using logistic regression. Findings: We included 10,184,021 births in the study, with 5.7% of these births from women who were internal migrants. The offspring of women who migrated to municipalities with equal/higher HDI (80% of migrations), exhibited a decreased risk of preterm births (RR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.93–0.95), low birth weight (RR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.92–0.95) and small for gestational age (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.91–0.93), but higher risk of congenital abnormalities (RR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.10–1.18). The offspring of women who migrated to municipalities with lower HDI had delayed access to healthcare and worse outcomes except for a lower risk of low birth weight (RR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.92–0.96). Interpretation: Offspring of those migrating to municipalities with equal/higher HDI tend to have better perinatal outcomes, whereas migrants to lower HDIs have a similar pattern to non-migrant women.

AB  - Background: Early-life trauma (before age of 18 years) is hypothesized to increase the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes through stress pathways, yet epidemiologic findings are mixed. Methods: Sister Study participants (US women aged 35–74 years enrolled 2003–2009) completed an adapted Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey at the first follow-up visit. Lifetime history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP: pregnancy-related high blood pressure, pre-eclampsia/toxemia, or eclampsia) in pregnancies lasting ≥20 weeks was self-reported. We used log–binomial regression to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between early-life trauma (modeled using conventional measures [e.g., any experience, substantive domains, individual types] and latent classes of co-occurring traumas) and GDM or HDP among 34,879 parous women. Results: Approximately, 4% of participants reported GDM and 11% reported HDP. Relative to no early-life trauma, the RRs for any were 1.1 (95% CI = 1.0, 1.3) for GDM and 1.2 (95% CI = 1.2, 1.3) for HDP. Women reporting physical trauma had the highest risk of GDM and HDP in comparison to other substantive domains. In analyses using latent classes of early-life trauma, high trauma was associated with an elevated risk of both GDM (RR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.5, 2.6) and HDP (RR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.4, 2.0) compared with low trauma. Conclusions: Women experiencing high levels of trauma in early life were at higher risk of GDM and HDP, adding to a growing evidence base for this association. © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Objective: Besides socioeconomic factors, environmental pollution, and climate change are contemporary threats to health. In this review, the authors present results from a recent comprehensive synthesis of existing research on the effects of air pollution and climate change on gestation, fetal development, and postnatal health. Data sources: Findings from systematic reviews conducted over the past five years and available in PubMed were used. Summary of findings: A vast and robust evidence exists on the association between air pollution exposures and negative outcomes. Gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, and maternal postpartum depression are reported. Fetal development and postnatal health are also impaired by exposures; low birth weight is a common finding from studies worldwide, but there are increased risks for malformations and impairments in neurodevelopment. While there are fewer studies on factors related to climate change, there is sufficient evidence regarding the direct and indirect effects on maternal health and fetal development. Increased risks for prematurity, low birth, and emergency room visits are associated with higher temperatures. Asthma incidence and infectious respiratory disease risks are also influenced by extreme weather events. It is essential to recognize the profound impact that environmental factors, such as air pollution and climate change can have on maternal health, fetal development, and neonatal health. Conclusion: The data presented underscores the significant risks that environmental pollution poses during gestation, influencing not only maternal health but also the short- and long-term well-being of the child. © 2024 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria

AB  - Objective: This study explores the cultural-based management of childbirth vulnerabilities in the hilly regions during cyclone periods, where the land mass has been frequently exposed to floods during and aftermath of cyclones due to low-high cyclonic depressions in the Bay of Bengal coast. Methods: The present study was a community-based qualitative observational study conducted for three weeks immediately after the two cyclonic periods occurred between October and December 2022. With the purposive sampling method, 21 postpartum mothers were selected on the inclusion criteria, of having had childbirth around the cyclonic period of ‘Sitrang’ (late October 2022) and ‘Mandous’ (early December 2022). Semi-structured in-depth interview schedules were employed to document socio-demographic profiles and probed for their cultural ways of managing childbirth complications and neonatal exposures to infections during the cyclonic period. Results: Views of 21 mothers were coded into three themes with two sub-themes each according to repeated frequencies of information. The themes were (a) Striving for Safe Childbirths; (b) Surviving with Traditional Capacities; (c) Strength and Sustenance. The results indicated that home deliveries were considered safest over institutional deliveries except in the cases of complicated childbirths confirmed difficult by the traditional birth attendants (TBA). Rough climatic conditions compounded by geographical distance, lack of appropriate financial help and timely transportation facilities were the major prevailing factors influencing their childbirth practices during the cyclonic periods. Conclusion: Disasters do not alone influence childbirth outcomes, but the evidence is still mixed. The expediency of birth technology has effectively managed childbirth vulnerabilities. Ensured sleep, rest and enough food had also been disturbed during and aftermath cyclones. The results showed an urgent need for focused planning on tribal areas for gestation, birthing and postpartum people during natural disasters. © 2024 National Neonatology Forum.

AB  - Importance In the current era of climate change, extreme heat exposure poses escalating threats to maternal-fetal health. Despite the expansive scale of extreme heat exposure worldwide, dramatized by the record-breaking global ocean and atmospheric temperatures throughout 2023 and into 2024, the extent of the threat posed by heat is underestimated and underappreciated. Unlike the physical destruction wrought by climate-driven events like hurricanes and wildfires, heat exposure does not cause severe damage to the built environment. Yet, in most years, heat has been the deadliest hazard in the United States. Objective This expert review aims to illuminate how climate-related heat affects maternal-fetal health and exacerbates health inequities. It will also discuss current knowledge gaps and underscore the crucial role that obstetric providers play in safeguarding pregnant persons from exposure to hazardous heat and increasing patient awareness of climate-related heat. Evidence Acquisition Evidence for this review was primarily acquired through a comprehensive search of PubMed-indexed articles using MeSH terms and text words to search for concepts related to "climate change,""heat,""obstetrics,""pregnancy,""heat stress disorders,"and their synonyms. Results Extreme heat exposure threatens the health and well-being of pregnant persons and elevates the likelihood of poor birth outcomes like preterm birth, fetal demise, and stillbirth, among other pregnancy complications. Extreme heat exposure also increases the risk of dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and gestational hypertension for pregnant persons. Conclusions and Relevance Ultimately, obstetric professionals are essential to improving the care of pregnant persons at increased risk from salient climate-related heat exposure. Target Audience Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians Learning Objectives After completing this activity, the learner will be better able to explain the adverse health and pregnancy outcomes associated with climate-related heat or extreme heat exposure; describe current gaps in the literature and what research and guidelines are needed to better the field's understanding of how climate-related heat affects obstetric patients; and identify strategies for communities, providers, and patients to minimize the health harms of climate-related heat or extreme heat exposure. © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - The world is facing substantial threats from climate change such as extreme weather events, floods, biodiversity loss, sea-level rise, and ecosystem degradation. The objective of this study is to assess the livelihood vulnerability index of communities in flood-prone areas, specifically investigating the reasons behind their vulnerability, their income sources, and the impact of flooding on economic activities. Pakistan is an agrarian country and known to be a climate vulnerable country, flood possess higher threat to rural livelihood. Mianwali district of Punjab, Pakistan was selected as the study area because it is among the poorest districts, and is most severely impacted district during 2010 catastrophe. The study employed qualitative methods like focus group discussions, interviews, and transect walks, alongside quantitative approaches such as the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI). Primary data was collected from 200 households through structured questionnaires by applying simple random sampling technique. Results demonstrated that the overall vulnerability of the local community of Mianwali to flood was high 0.4 score (out of 5) as per Livelihood Vulnerability Index criteria. It was revealed that the exposure factor (0.424) significantly influenced vulnerability and communities had low adaptive capacity (0.077) in the face of flood hazard. While the sensitivity of Mianwali’s community to flood scored 0.088. These findings are crucial for policymakers to assess baseline causes of livelihood vulnerability and formulate adaptation for other rural communities. It can be concluded that addressing these factors effectively in planning strategies may mitigate vulnerability and increase communities’ capacity to deal with potential flooding. © 2025 Akram et al.

AB  - The Northeast of Brazil is a leading region for small ruminants. However, these herds are primarily located in the semi-arid region and face significant losses due to fetal and perinatal mortality, frequently linked to the consumption of teratogenic toxic plants during pregnancy. This study investigated the clinical and epidemiological aspects related to abortions and malformations in 80 small ruminant farms in the semi-arid region of Brazil. Necropsies were also performed on fetuses and neonates, along with histopathological, molecular, and serological analyses of the herds to differentiate other conditions. Malformations were identified on approximately 42 farms, with arthrogryposis being the most common abnormality. Toxic plants, including Mimosa tenuiflora and Cenostigma pyramidalis, were recorded on 95.23% of the properties with reported malformations. Additionally, necropsies confirmed the association between the occurrence of these plants and malformations, abortions, and mortality, excluding infectious causes. These results underscore the urgent need for prevention and control strategies to mitigate the impact of toxic plants on small ruminant production in the semi-arid region. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review the literature on associations between climate drivers and health outcomes among pregnant people. This review fills a gap by synthesizing evidence for a clinician audience. Data Sources: Systematic scoping review of articles published in PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov from January 2010 through December 2023. Study Eligibility Criteria: Empirical studies published in English-language peer-reviewed journals, assessing associations between select climate drivers and adverse maternal and birth outcomes. The review included studies examining heat, storms, sea level rise, flooding, drought, wildfires, and other climate-related factors. Health outcomes included preterm birth, low birthweight, small for gestational age, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, miscarriage/stillbirth and maternal mortality. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: The scoping review protocol was registered with the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202410004, January 3, 2024) and conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Data were extracted by 2 authors; quality and risk of bias was assessed independently. Results: Total of 966 references were screened; 16.35% (k=158) met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies (146/158; 92.4%) documented statistically significant and clinically meaningful associations between climate drivers and adverse perinatal health outcomes, including risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, and stillbirth as well as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, miscarriage, and maternal death. Among the most durable findings: extreme heat exposure in early and late pregnancy were associated with increased risk of preterm birth and stillbirth. Driven in part by large (often population-based) studies and objective outcomes from surveillance data or medical record reviews, studies in this scoping review were evaluated as high quality (scoring 7-9 on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale). Risk of bias was generally low. Conclusions: Climate drivers are consistently associated with adverse health outcomes for pregnant people. Continuing education for clinicians, and clinician-patient communications should be expanded to address risks of climate change and extreme weather exposure, especially risks of extreme heat in late-pregnancy. Results from this review should inform multilevel interventions to address adverse health effects of climate during pregnancy as well as practice advisories, protocols, checklists, and clinical guidelines in obstetrics. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Stunting continues to be a major public health concern worldwide and can have lifelong consequences for the affected individuals in terms of both physical and cognitive development. Among South Asian countries, Pakistan continues to experience consistently high rates of stunting, owing to a wide range of factors. National nutrition surveys and reports by various international organisations indicate that a significant reduction has not been observed in stunting rates over the last 3-4 decades and that the progress for mitigating the problem remains inadequate. The current report was planned to analyse nationally representative surveys done in 2001-02, 2011 and 2018 to ascertain the major determinants of stunting, their complex interplay, and the contribution of these determinants to the increased prevalence of stunting in Pakistan. © 2025 Pakistan Medical Association.

AB  - Primary anal cancers are rare and typically driven by high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Though squamous cell carcinoma is most common, a spectrum of HPV-related nonsquamous anogenital neoplasms with similarities to cervical stratified mucin-producing carcinoma has been reported. In this study, we mined our institutional archives to characterize the clinicopathologic features of this emerging entity. Six cases were identified from the files at 2 institutions, including 4 cases of invasive stratified mucin-producing carcinoma and 2 stratified mucin-producing intraepithelial lesions (SMILE). Four patients were women, and the mean age was 70 years. Patients presented with rectal/anal mass or polyp, rectal bleeding or pain, weight loss, or at the time of screening colonoscopy. Tumors displayed histologic features as described in the gynecologic tract. Cases of invasive stratified mucinous carcinoma showed infiltrative tumor nests with variable intracytoplasmic mucin, peripheral palisading, prominent apoptosis, and neutrophilic infiltrate. One invasive stratified mucinous carcinoma associated with high grade glandular dysplasia, whereas 1 SMILE was next to conventional low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. All lesions stained with p16 showed block-like p16 expression. HPV in situ hybridization was performed in 5 cases, 4 of which were positive; one was interpreted as equivocal.

AB  - The true umbilical cord knot has an incidence at birth of up to 1.22 %. During prenatal ultrasound scanning, a cloverleaf pattern, the hanging rope sign, fixed loop, cord loop or cyclone sign may be observed. A clinical case of prenatal diagnosis of true cord knot with good perinatal outcome is reported. We present the case of a 28-year-old female patient at 33.1 weeks of gestation. The ultrasound scan showed a cloverleaf pattern, a hanging rope sign and a fixed loop in the umbilical cord, confirming the suspicion of a true cord knot, as shown by color Doppler and 3D imaging. Weekly follow-up with Doppler ultrasound and non-stress testing was conducted. A cesarean section was scheduled at 37 weeks, resulting in a newborn weighing 2,870 grams and measuring 47 cm, with no signs of asphyxiation. The diagnosis was confirmed at birth. 3D and 4D ultrasound imaging has proven to be reliable a method for diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 87.5 %, specificity of 99.6 % and precision of 96.9 %. The true knot is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes, including fetal acidosis, meconium in the amniotic fluid, preterm birth, low Apgar at one minute, increased risk of admission to the neonatal care unit, and up to a 4- to 8-fold higher fetal death rate before delivery. The incidental discovery of a true knot presents a dilemma for both the patient and the obstetrician, especially because its surveillance, management, timing and method of pregnancy resolution currently lack an evidence-based approach. With technological advancements and the increasing number of maternal-fetal medicine specialists who use ultrasound techniques to focus on umbilical cord pathology, the prenatal detection rate can be improved, contributing to a reduction in sudden and unexpected perinatal morbidity and mortality. © © 2025, Revista Horizonte Médico (Lima).

AB  - Purpose: Maternal mortality in Malawi is high, with low coverage of maternity care being a contributing factor. To improve maternal health coverage, an Android-based, integrated mobile health (mHealth) app called YendaNafe was introduced to community health workers (CHWs) in the Neno district, rural Malawi. This study evaluates the impact of this app on the uptake of antenatal care (ANC), facility-based births, and postnatal care (PNC), compared to a reference period where CHWs provided the same services without mHealth, using the interrupted time series analysis. Patients and Methods: Using aggregated monthly data and segmented quasi-Poisson regression models, we compared the effects of mHealth on selected maternal health outcomes. The models were adjusted for the COVID-19 pandemic, the occurrence of cyclones, and a cholera epidemic. We analyzed data from six eligible health facilities and their respective catchment areas in which CHWs were using YendaNafe, and compared 12 months before and 12 months after its introduction. Results: The use of YendaNafe was associated with a 22% immediate increase in facility-based births (aIRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12–1.33, p<0.001) but not an immediate increase in new ANC visits (aIRR 1.02,95% CI 0.90–1.14, p=0.77), ANC in the first trimester (aIRR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95–1.45 p=0.13), or PNC visits (aIRR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79–1.36, p=0.81). For long-term effect, YendaNafe was associated with an increase in new ANC visits (aIRR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01–1.07, p <0.01) and ANC in the first trimester (aIRR 1.03,95% CI 1.00–1.07 p=0.046), but not facility-based births (aIRR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99–1.03, p=0.46) or PNC (aIRR 0.97 95% CI 0.93–1.01, p=0.14). Conclusion: mHealth shows potential of increasing utilization of new ANC visits, ANC in the first trimester and facility-based births. Further research is needed to understand why mHealth did not have an effect on PNC. © 2025 Kachimanga et al.

AB  - Background: As extreme events such as drought and flood are projected to increase in frequency and intensity under climate change, there is still large missing evidence on how drought exposure potentially impacts mortality among young children. This study aimed to investigate the association between drought and risk of infant mortality in Africa, a region highly vulnerable to climate change that bears the heaviest share of the global burden. Methods and findings: In this cross-sectional study, we obtained data on infant mortality in 34 African countries during 1992–2019 from the Demographic and Health Surveys program. We measured drought by the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index at a timescale of 24 months and a spatial resolution of 10 × 10 km, which was further dichotomized into mild and severe drought. The association between drought exposure and infant mortality risk was estimated using Cox regression models allowing time-dependent covariates. We further examined whether the association varied for neonatal and post-neonatal mortality and whether there was a delayed association with drought exposure during pregnancy or infancy. The mean (standard deviation) number of months in which children experienced any drought during pregnancy and survival period (from birth through death before 1 year of age) was 4.6 (5.2) and 7.3 (7.4) among cases and non-cases, respectively. Compared to children who did not experience drought, we did not find evidence that any drought exposure was associated with an increased risk of infant mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.00, 1.04], p = 0.072). When stratified by drought severity, we found a statistically significant association with severe drought (HR: 1.04; 95% CI [1.01, 1.07], p = 0.015), but no significant association with mild drought (HR: 1.01; 95% CI [0.99, 1.03], p = 0.353), compared to non-exposure to any drought. However, when excluding drought exposure during pregnancy, the association with severe drought was found to be non-significant. In addition, an increased risk of neonatal mortality was associated with severe drought (HR: 1.05; 95% CI [1.01, 1.10], p = 0.019), but not with mild drought (HR: 0.99; 95% CI [0.96, 1.02], p = 0.657). Conclusions: Exposure to long-term severe drought was associated with increased infant mortality risk in Africa. Our findings urge more effective adaptation measures and alleviation strategies against the adverse impact of drought on child health. © 2025 Wang et al.

AB  - Background: With wildfires increasing globally due to climate change, children may be more behaviourally exposed and more physiologically vulnerable to adverse health outcomes. Objective: To complete a comprehensive investigation of epidemiological studies examining respiratory and non-respiratory impacts of wildfires to identify research gaps and inform decision-making to protect children's health. Data Sources: The databases searched were PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Google Scholar. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Global epidemiological studies that investigated individuals under the age of 18 and were published from January 2006 to July 2024 were eligible to be included. Studies were included if they had wildfire days, smoke, or pollutants as the main exposure and had an outcome related to children's health. Though a meta-analysis was not possible, results were reported qualitatively through summaries of evidence tables and noteworthy results and the magnitude of the associations for each outcome was reported. Results: Twenty-four studies were selected. Sixteen studies examined respiratory outcomes and 11 studies included non-respiratory outcomes. A meta-analysis was not conducted, and consistent conclusions could not be made due to the heterogeneity and the small number of studies. Most respiratory-related studies found positive associations between wildfire exposure and adverse respiratory outcomes. All non-respiratory outcomes, except physical activity, had positive associations with wildfire exposure. For most non-respiratory outcomes, only one study evaluated each outcome. Higher-risk children were asthmatic, obese, under the age of five, in low-income countries or with a low socio-economic status. Conclusions: There is consistent evidence that wildfire exposure is associated with adverse respiratory health in children, globally. There is less consistent evidence for the effect of wildfire exposure on non-respiratory outcomes. Further long-term research on non-respiratory outcomes in children, specifically physical activity, academic success and mental health is needed, especially in high-risk populations. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This study aimed to assess long-term changes in pregnancy and birth outcomes after the Great East Japan Earthquake and the accident at the Tokyo Electric Power Company’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Fukushima Prefecture. This is the final report on perinatal outcomes of the Prefectural Health Survey, which ended after a 10-year observation period. Questionnaires based on a pregnancy and birth survey conducted by the Radiation Medical Science Center for the Fukushima Health Management Survey were sent to women who had received maternal and child health handbooks from municipal officers in Fukushima Prefecture. Annual data from six geographic areas in Fukushima Prefecture were separately analyzed. The number of eligible respondents, which was approximately 16,000 in 2011 when the earthquake occurred, declined temporarily the following year, recovered temporarily one year later, and has gradually declined since then. However, the response rate remained at approximately 50% throughout the decade. The incidence of preterm deliveries, low-birthweight infants, and congenital anomalies did not vary over the decade and showed a similar trend in national surveys and general reports. Our analysis shows that the disaster had no significant adverse perinatal outcomes in Fukushima Prefecture and we recommend measures to ensure the safe delivery of babies in the region. © 2024 The Fukushima Society of Medical Science.

AB  - Crush trauma of extremities, resulting from a crushing force, can be life-threatening even without involving vital organs. Crush syndrome, or traumatic rhabdomyolysis, occurs when muscle cell breakdown releases contents into the bloodstream, leading to systemic complications like acute renal failure. A 35-year-old woman trapped under rubble during11 hours during a seismic event, presenting with compartment syndrome in her left arm and thigh and crush syndrome. Emergent fasciotomy and aggressive fluid resuscitation were performed, preventing renal failure and metabolic derangement. Post-fasciotomy, pulses returned to her affected limbs. She was extubated and moved to the ICU under close surgical supervision. Early, aggressive resuscitation is critical, ideally before extrication, to minimize complications. Awareness of hyperkalemia and acute renal failure risk post-extrication is essential. Continuous fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of treatment, and prompt fasciotomies are crucial for compartment syndrome management. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Exposure to tropical cyclones during pregnancy can adversely influence neonatal and birth outcomes, contributing to low birth weight and preterm birth. These outcomes could be impacted by the disruption of healthcare and infrastructure, as well as stress and injury. Although research has focused on the impacts on neonatal health from extreme tropical events, little is known about the neonatal health impacts of moderate-intensity hurricanes or hurricanes that reduce intensity before landfall. The aim of this study is to 1) assess the causal association between hurricane exposure and the adverse birth outcomes of low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB) using a difference-in-difference analysis and 2) identify differences in spatial patterns for the adverse birth outcomes LBW and PTB pre- and post-Hurricane Isabel, a Category 2 storm that impacted North Carolina in 2003. The geospatial analysis included multiple buffers of 30, 60, and 100 km to define exposure and local spatial autocorrelation statistics. The results were predominantly insignificant, with some key exceptions. The difference-in-difference analysis found a statistically negative association between hurricane exposure and preterm birth, suggesting an unexpected reduction in preterm births post-storm. We found that exposure to Hurricane Isabel (2003) and LWB were statistically significant at the 30 and 100-km spatial buffers; exposure was also associated with a decrease in PTB at the 30 km buffer. We also examined differences in potential impacts by trimester and found a significant negative association during the second and third trimesters. Significant differences in the clustering of LBW and PTB before and after Isabel made landfall were also found, with new clusters of higher PTB and LBW forming along the storm track. Results from our study highlight the need for further analysis of neonatal and birth outcomes across different hurricane types and the need for spatial analysis to understand fine-scale heterogeneity in hurricane risk. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increase in wildfires and bushfires due to climate change means that more people, including pregnant women and their fetuses will be exposed to landscape fire smoke. Although there is evidence to suggest that pregnancy landscape fire exposure is associated with lower birth weight, preterm birth and pregnancy loss, there is a lack of information on many other perinatal outcomes, as well as information on subsequent respiratory outcomes in children. Furthermore, due to the generally short term (hours/days) and intermittent nature of landscape fire smoke exposure, the knowledge to date has largely relied on natural experiments and ecological studies which can be subject to misclassification of exposure and a lack of precision. On the other hand, general urban outdoor air pollution exposure during pregnancy and subsequent perinatal and respiratory effects has been well studied. In particular, as air exposure modelling has improved so have the adaptations of methods to analyze the effects of air pollution exposure during pregnancy enabling critical windows of exposure to be identified. In this narrative review we summarize the current state of knowledge about the perinatal and respiratory effects of pregnancy landscape fire and particulate matter <2.5 μm in diameter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) air pollution exposure, including a comment on analysis methods to date, and an assessment of how methodologies used in general air pollution research in relation to pregnancy exposure can be further harnessed for landscape fire smoke exposure pregnancy research. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The impact of tropical cyclones on adverse pregnancy outcomes is garnering increasing attention against the backdrop of global warming. This article systematically reviews the epidemiological associations and potential mechanisms linking tropical cyclone exposure to preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age. Evidence suggests that tropical cyclones are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age. The underlying mechanisms involve complex interactions across multiple pathways, such as maternal stress, placental dysfunction, and oxidative stress. However, existing research exhibits a geographical bias, with the majority of studies conducted in high-income countries. Future efforts should prioritize multicenter epidemiological studies in low- and middle-income regions to facilitate the development of targeted, region-specific intervention strategies for protecting maternal and child health. 2025, Chinese Medical Association

AB  - The climate crisis poses major challenges to reproductive justice. Climate-related events and natural disasters are severely impacting sexual and reproductive rights as well as the ability of individuals to become parents and care for their children. Through a systematic review conducted using the PRISMA method, this article addresses the impact of the climate crisis on the three core principles of reproductive justice: (1) the right not to have a child; (2) the right to have a child; and (3) the right to parent children in safe and healthy environments. While the review found no empirical studies addressing how the climate crisis impacts the right not to have children, the findings suggest that hurricanes, floods, heatwaves, droughts, and coastal erosion are associated with greater intentions of remaining childless and having fewer children, increasing fetal mortality and preterm births, decreasing new-born sex ratios and birth weight, rising birth risks, declining birth rates, and increasing challenges to parenting and childcare. We argue that the climate crisis fundamentally undermines reproductive justice by preventing individuals from fully and equitably exercising their reproductive rights to have children and to parent in safe and sustainable environments. In doing so, we stress that the climate crisis should be considered when addressing the challenges of reproductive justice and that addressing these challenges requires implementing policies that not only seek to mitigate the effects of climate disruptions but also strengthen the capacity of individuals and communities to adapt to changing environmental conditions, ensuring more sustainable reproductive futures. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Climate change disproportionately affects children due to their unique physiological, developmental, and social vulnerabilities. Among them, children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN) face compounding risks resulting from pre-existing health conditions, limited mobility, dependence on assistive devices, and systemic barriers to health care and social support. This chapter explores how climate change intersects with childhood development and disability, beginning with the perinatal period, where prenatal exposure to extreme heat, air pollution, and nutritional stress can result in preterm birth, congenital anomalies, and neurodevelopmental challenges. The chapter additionally examines specific pediatric disabilities, including cerebral palsy and spina bifida; highlighting how these conditions amplify children's susceptibility during climate-related events. It further discusses the impact of climate change on children with cognitive and psychological disabilities, emphasizing the heightened risks of trauma, anxiety, and exclusion in emergency planning and response. There is a final call for urgent integration of disability-inclusive approaches in climate adaptation, health systems strengthening, and policy development to protect and empower this often overlooked population in a rapidly changing world. © 2026 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Population growth, urbanization, modernization, and industry increase are the main factors for the increasing industrial, institutional, and municipal waste rate. Different kinds of activity generate enormous quantities of waste. More complex and heterogeneous wastes are produced daily because of the changing living standards and food habits. Due to the decomposition of garbage, different harmful gases are released, such as methane. Plastic is a significant irritant in municipal solid trash, polluting the environment, clogging drains, and causing floods during the rainy season. Waste handlers and waste pickers are the major vulnerable risk groups. Solid waste, especially excreta and others, can create health hazards if not properly disposed of. Due to increased quantities of waste sent to incineration, it will emit more toxins and pollutants that will produce more air pollution. Waste incineration systems have long been connected with harmful pollutant emissions that harm human and environmental health. Uncontrolled hazardous wastes from industries create potential public health threats such as chemical poisoning, degraded water and soil quality, low birth weight (LBW) babies, nausea, vomiting, neurological disease, skin irritation, blood infections, cancer, respiratory problems, and growth problems. Diseases associated with domestic solid pollutants include cholera, malaria, Lassa fever, and diarrhea, with malaria being the most prevalent. Unscientific waste burning or incineration results in the emission of toxic vapors containing mercury, heavy metals, and so forth, and has significant associations with neoplasia, infant mortality, congenital anomalies, and miscarriage. Recycling must be regulated to prevent adverse effects on soil, vegetation, animals, and people. © 2026 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Almost half of the under-5 mortality in resource-limited settings occurs within the neonatal period (birth to 28 days of life). Despite improvements to under-5 mortality globally, the rate of improvement in the neonatal population is much slower. The vast majority of neonatal deaths are attributed to prematurity, intrapartum complications, congenital anomalies, and infection. Recognizing the sick infant at birth and effective resuscitation of the newborn is critical, and many low-cost interventions have the greatest impact in improving outcomes. This chapter focuses on actions that can be taken during delivery and the immediate postpartum period to improve the immediate care of the newborn after birth by following the clinical guidance described in the World Health Organization Essential Newborn Care 1. © 2025 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: The Kulawa village, a hard-to-reach community in Bauchi State, Nigeria, was visited by an NGO initially for mass HIV and malaria screenings. However, it was discovered that women remained isolated at home despite facing maternal health challenges such as prolonged labor and other pregnancy complications. These issues were worsened by climate change, particularly during annual floods, which created severe barriers to accessing healthcare, leaving the community dependent on traditional birth attendants (TBAs) and distant health centers. Objective: The case study aims to present health access challenges exacerbated by climate change and the implementation of sustainable local healthcare workforce strategies that improve maternal healthcare adaptation in the Kulawa community. Methods: The NGO engaged community stakeholders to discuss the health impacts of climate change, especially during flooding and emphasized early health-seeking behaviors. The community supported the course by donating land where the community clinic was built. The NGO also initiated a community education program, identifying 15 young children (ages 13–15) and providing them with the resources needed to pursue healthcare education, with the long-term goal of creating a sustainable local health workforce. Findings: Fifteen children aged 13–15 were supported with bicycles, books, and extra lessons, eventually passed their high school examinations, and proceeded to medical and health professional training. Fourteen graduated from healthcare professions and were initially engaged in voluntary services and eventually employed by the Bauchi Local Government Health Authority. Their deployment to their community significantly improved health outcomes. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Worster-Drought syndrome (WDS) is a rare congenital pseudobulbar palsy causing speech and feeding difficulties due to impaired corticobulbar pathways. Symptoms include drooling, chewing difficulties, dysarthria, and motor impairments, often categorized under cerebral palsy. Case Report: We report a 13-year-old female with cerebral palsy (double hemiplegia), pseudobulbar palsy, global developmental delay, and speech delay. Key features included drooling since birth, chewing difficulty, and inability to speak. Birth history revealed severe asphyxia and meconium aspiration, requiring a 20-day NICU stay. Developmental delays were evident, with head control at one year and ambulation at two years. Examination showed left-predominant spasticity, hyperreflexia, muscle wasting, dynamic Achilles tendon contracture, and right-sided facial asymmetry. MRI revealed peri-insular temporal gliosis. Multidisciplinary management with speech, oral motor, and swallowing therapy was initiated, emphasizing continued follow-up and home-based exercises. Results: The case underscores the complexity of managing CP with pseudobulbar palsy, necessitating targeted therapy for motor, speech, and feeding impairments. Conclusion: Early multidisciplinary intervention in WDS can significantly improve communication, feeding, and daily functioning, enhancing the quality of life. © 2025, Cises srl. All rights reserved.

AB  - Throughout history, every significant stage of life, such as birth, puberty, marriage and death, and the transition from one period of life to another, has been ritualized in many religions and societies. Among these stages, birth has been considered a sacred event to some extent in every era and place throughout history. Each stage—prenatal, intrapartum and postnatal—caused both physical and psychological effects. One of these changes is postpartum syndrome. Postpartum syndrome is an important disorder that has been recognized by society throughout history. The physiological and psychological effects of this syndrome, which is identified and defined in contemporary clinical studies, have been observed and interpreted throughout history. In the absence of modern medicine, people mythologized the postpartum syndrome and identified it with supernatural beings, just like every phenomenon they could not make sense of. In traditional beliefs, people thought that the changes occurring in the mother’s body, infertility, infant mortality, or medical conditions like mis-carriage were caused by supernatural entities. They developed various methods to protect pregnant women, new mothers, and babies from supernatural beings that were believed to cause harm. Today, in Anatolia, it is still believed that ailments affecting pregnant women, new mothers, and babies are caused by a supernatural entity called Alkarısı. Various methods have been developed to protect against Alkarısı, which vary between regions. Methods such as wearing amulets, making paste from various plants, making tea and burning incense have been developed. Today, in Anatolia, traditional practices such as tying a red ribbon around the heads of new mothers and the beds of babies, and placing a knife under the pillow, have become customary. Although Alkarısı is a belief specific to Anatolia, concerns about the health of the mother and baby, and the embodiment of postpartum syndrome, date back to much earlier periods in written sources. In the history of Anatolia, the earliest cuneiform documents show that societies were very sensitive about the health of the mother and baby during and after childbirth. According to these cuneiform records, there were various healing and protective rituals performed before, during, and after birth. These rituals were solutions for existing maternal and infant health and psychology. Just as in modern times, people in ancient times believed that diseases and evils were caused by supernatural forces. The earliest known supernatural being affecting maternal and infant health was Lamaštu. Lamaštu, a Demon originally from Mesopotamia, was also believed in Anatolia. Lamaštu is a deeply rooted figure in the history of belief, appearing in incantation texts, prayer texts, mythological texts, and amulets. It was associated with physiological diseases such as abortion, infant mortality, infertility, gynecological diseases, maternal mortality, impotence, sexual dysfunctions, epidemics, infectious diseases, hepatitis, jaundice, and psychological diseases such as depression, panic attacks, anxiety, and personality disorders. It was also associated with destruction, disaster, famine, plant and animal reproductive disorders and the birth of other living beings. The demon’s antagonistic character, which hindered the continuity of birth and fertility associated with abundance and life, contributed to its belief in Anatolia as well. Lamaštu’s influence spread to Anatolia as early as the Assyrian Trade Colonies Period through Assyrian merchants. During this period, amulets found were aimed at protecting homes from the demon. In the later period, rituals to protect the physiological and psychological health of mother and baby are found in Hittite cuneiform documents. Although there is no personified postpartum syndrome demon in this period, Lamaštu amulets were found again in Anatolia during the Late Hittite period. The study focused on indirect and direct evidence regarding postpartum syndrome in ancient Anatolia based on the earliest cuneiform documents and archaeological data. The focus is on Lamaštu, the personified and mythologized form of the syndrome. In cuneiform texts, while there was no specific diagnosis, medical term, or definitive treatment for postpartum syndrome, the healing rituals performed indirectly addressed preventive measures against the syndrome. Despite not being explicitly named in the records that have survived to the present day, equating postpartum syndrome with a supernatural entity indicates that individual illness was perceived as a societal phenomenon in ancient Anatolia. © 2025, Milli Folklor Dergisi.

AB  - Introduction: Health and performance of dairy calves can be influenced by the intra-uterine environment. Environmental stressors such as heat stress, maternal inflammatory status, and nutrient deficiencies have been shown to impair intra-uterine and postnatal development in dairy cattle, with implications for long-term productivity. Recent studies in primates have reported lower birth weights and altered infant inflammatory markers associated with maternal exposure to wildfire smoke particulate matter (wildfire-PM<inf>2.5</inf>) during pregnancy. However, the impact of intra-uterine exposure to wildfire-PM<inf>2.5</inf> on dairy calf growth and health is unknown. Methods: Holstein heifer calves were born to cows exposed (WFS, n = 17) or unexposed (CON, n = 26) to wildfire smoke during mid gestation. Calves were monitored from birth through 6 months of life to evaluate growth patterns, health, and basal metabolic and inflammatory markers. Results: Although there was no difference detected between groups in gestation length or calf frame size at birth, WFS calves had lower birth weights compared with that of CON (36.87 ± 0.87 kg vs. 40.82 ± 0.80 kg). WFS calves had greater average daily gain in the pre-weaning period but lower gain in the post-weaning period compared with CON. WFS calves also had greater plasma glucose concentrations in the pre-weaning period, lower β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations in the early post-weaning period, and greater non-esterified fatty acid concentrations for much of the pre-weaning and the early post-weaning period relative to those for CON calves. In addition, WFS calves had lower white blood cell counts throughout the preweaning period, coupled with greater serum albumin and lower serum amyloid A through the study, as well as lower haptoglobin concentrations at approximately 3 months of age. All calves received adequate passive transfer of immunity, but WFS calves had greater serum IgG concentrations, yet no difference was detected in apparent efficiency of IgG absorption compared with that for CON. WFS calves had lower odds of lung consolidation throughout the study. Discussion: Overall, these results indicate that prenatal exposure to wildfire particulates restricts fetal growth and programs postnatal calf metabolic and immune systems, which may have implications for future health and productivity. © © 2025 Pace, Villamediana, Rovai, Ponce, Ellis, Stegeman, Larson, Konetchy, Rezamand and Skibiel.

AB  - Background: Climate change has been described as the greatest health threat of the 21st century. Increased evidence of the linkages between climate change and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) is essential to achieving full realization of SRHR. Objective: To understand if and how women and girls’ perceived climate vulnerability impacts their SRHR decision-making, behaviors, and outcomes in cyclone-affected communities in coastal Khulna, Bangladesh, we conducted qualitative research using an intersectional climate justice lens. Design: Climate justice states that the climate crisis is not just an environmental or health problem, it is equally a political and social problem, whereby different communities feel the consequences differently, unevenly, and disproportionately depending on a multitude of factors shaped by intersecting systems of power and oppression. We adopted an intersectional climate justice lens to explore how women and girls’ intersecting identities impact their experiences with climate change – particularly extreme weather events – and impact their perceived vulnerability. We employed a two-phased participatory qualitative research design. Methods: We conducted key informant interviews with local SRHR and climate change experts (n = 10) plus in-depth interviews (n = 15) and community dialog meetings (n = 8) with women and girls of reproductive age (n = 49). Transcripts, activity outputs, and field notes were transcribed verbatim in Bangla, translated to English, and subsequently coded and analyzed thematically using Dedoose. Results: Participants perceived numerous SRHR outcomes to be worsened by the climate crisis, including unintended pregnancy, sexual and gender-based violence, and pregnancy complications. Impacts were experienced differently across social categories, with overlapping identities including age, marital status, and religion magnifying vulnerability and risks to SRHR. Participants identified comprehensive SRHR and advances toward gender equity as essential for building climate resilience. Conclusion: Our findings provide actionable recommendations to support the full realization of climate justice and SRHR. © The Author(s) 2025.

AU  - Kumar, N.
T2  - International Journal of Law and Management
PY  - 2025
AB  - Purpose: To explore the actual condition of the city after the gas emission and the effects of the tragedy on the community nearby industry. Examine the roles and responsibilities of Union Carbide Corporation, its parent company and the Indian government in the disaster, highlighting failures in industrial safety, crisis management and post-tragedy justice. Evaluate the sufficiency and inadequacy of the financial compensation, legal judgement and rehabilitation given to the victims in terms of why monetary settlements alone could not heal the irreparable damage. Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology for this study involves the use of secondary data from a broad spectrum of credible references, including academic journals, books, government websites and official reports. Data collection for this research will involve reviewing the literature and relevant archive records pertaining to the subject matter of the research study. This secondary data then is analysed systematically, categorized and synthesized to satisfy the objectives of the research. It then adopts a methodology that guarantees sound foundations for the study using established information to derive significant insights and conclusions without making primary data collection. Findings: The findings of this paper reveal the devastating and long-lasting impact of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy on both the environment and the affected communities. The gas leak caused immediate death, widespread illness and long-term health issues such as respiratory diseases and birth defects. Union Carbide’s negligence, along with its parent company’s lack of oversight and the Indian government’s failure to enforce safety regulations, played significant roles in the disaster. In addition, the financial compensation and rehabilitation efforts were found to be insufficient, leaving victims with unresolved health, psychological and social challenges, highlighting the inadequacy of monetary settlements in addressing the full extent of the tragedy. Originality/value: This paper offers an original analysis of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy by examining its long-term impact on the environment and community, highlighting corporate and government accountability and evaluating the sufficiency of compensation and rehabilitation efforts. It provides fresh insights into the inadequacies of post-tragedy responses and their lasting effects on victims. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Objectives: Adverse social contexts, such as lockdowns and disasters during pregnancy, can significantly impact maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, the specific effects on different populations remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the variations in pregnancy outcomes resulting from the pandemic lockdown and to identify distinct populations in need of targeted intervention. Methods: Women who delivered at our institution spanning from 2017 to 2019 (pre-pandemic) and from 2020 to 2022 (during the pandemic lockdown) were included in this study. A comparison was conducted on maternal and neonatal outcomes across a total of 19,382 singleton pregnancies, with a specific focus on those affected by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Results: As a total of 19,382 singleton pregnant women were included, this study found a significant increase in the incidence rates of GDM with an odds ratio of 1.194 (95%CI: 1.109–1.286, p < .001). Additionally, following the pandemic lockdown, there was an increase in rates of premature birth, premature rupture of membranes, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Further analysis of the GDM cohort revealed a notable rise in the risk of Group B Streptococcus infection and neonatal small for gestational age (SGA). Specifically, GDM patients with a body mass index (BMI) less than 18.5 kg/m2 exhibited an increased risk of fetal growth restriction and SGA. Conclusions: The pandemic lockdown adversely affected pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, targeted screening and clinical management for specific populations should be prioritized. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Context: Climate disasters have been tied to prenatal stress and pregnancy outcomes. However, it is unclear if these outcomes are influenced by the stage of foetal development when the disaster hits. Objective: To compare the birth outcomes by trimester for those pregnant during Hurricane Florence and those in the same community 1-2 years earlier. We further assessed the role of marital status and race. Methods: We included people who gave birth between 2016–2019 in one of the coastal communities impacted by Hurricane Florence (n = 7,240). We used multiple logistic regression to determine the effects of period (hurricane or pre-hurricane) and trimester and their respective interactions on birth outcomes controlling for key demographic variables. Results: Individuals in their first trimester during the hurricane had a greater likelihood of having low-birthweight, low-APGAR, or preterm babies compared to those in the same community a year earlier and those in later trimesters during the hurricane. Unmarried individuals in their first trimester during the hurricane were particularly at risk for low-birthweight neonates. Conclusion: Increased prenatal stress associated with disasters disrupts first trimester foetal development across all groups but is most pronounced in unmarried individuals. Differences in birthweight reflect intergenerational impacts in disaster events. © 2025 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper focuses on political decentralisation as an institutional determinant of the level and spatial distribution of infant mortality rates (IMR). At the national level, we show that political decentralisation is linked to lower IMR, but these benefits are concentrated in high-income decentralised nations. In developing nations, decentralisation is associated with significantly higher spatial variation in IMR. We explore the mechanisms driving these patterns by leveraging floods as plausibly exogenous events in our global sample and a detailed analysis of Brazil. In Brazil, floods increase municipal variation in IMR, with impacts disproportionately accruing in low-income municipalities with limited government services. © 2024 Regional Studies Association.

AB  - Objective: Background: Case Report: Conclusions: Rare coexistence of disease or pathology Renal artery aneurysms (RAA) are rare in the general population, with an incidence of 0.09%. Typically, they are asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally on imaging for other indications. Women comprise 72% of those affected and are rare in pregnancy. Undiagnosed left renal atrophy occurs in 1.3% of the general population. Pregnancy is characterized by physiologic changes that result in an increased risk of renal artery aneurysm leaking, dissecting, and rupture. RAA rupture in the third trimester can result in a devastating maternal-fetal catastrophe, depending on the length of time from the rupture event to surgical resolution. A 39-year-old woman with 1 previous cesarean delivery presented to our center at 36 weeks of gestation on transport from an outside emergency department with a sudden onset of right flank pain without vaginal bleeding, hematuria, or uterine contractions. On arrival, she was hypotensive and had an agonal fetal heart rate. An emergency cesarean delivery resulted in a depressed, acidotic infant. An expanding maternal retroperitoneal hematoma was found to be secondary to a ruptured RAA. Because of a newly-diagnosed atrophic left kidney, an endovascular repair of the right renal artery was performed. She was discharged on day 12. The infant was discharged after 6 months, meeting the developmental milestones. A ruptured RAA in the third trimester of pregnancy is a potentially life-threatening event for both mother and infant. It is particularly complicated if the uninvolved kidney is atrophic, which limits surgical remedies. A robust team of available tertiary-level care units can improve the time from rupture to surgical intervention and can help decrease maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. © Am J Case Rep, 2025.

AB  - Introduction. The achievements and failures of the Soviet government aimed at combating Volga region famine in 1921-1922 had an impact on social policy in the first decade of the Soviet state. The study of the experience of social policy in relation to families and children evacuated from the Volga region is becoming especially relevant in modern conditions of searching for effective forms of social assistance to families trapped in areas of natural disasters and military conflicts. Methods and materials. The publication is based on numerous archival records, which contain documents on the organization of social work with families and children of the Volga region, resettled in 1921-1923 in the Smolensk province. The key methods were source analysis, methods of everyday history, and microhistory. The documents of the funds of the provincial and district commissions for helping the starving in the Volga region and the provincial and district health departments of the State Archives of the Smolensk region were studied. Analysis. The Сentrally developed plan for the evacuation of refugees went out of control in the first months due to a lack of local funds and an uncontrolled flow of refugees. The main efforts in the region were thrown at the organization of social work with evacuated children. Working with arriving children has become a serious test for local authorities. All financial costs for the maintenance of refugees fell on the region. The number of children who arrived in the province exceeded the planned values by more than 2 times. For the first time in the region, a new model of charity was tested, which consisted of the mass and mandatory participation of all groups of the population and foreign organizations. The main methods of working with children were placing them in specialized orphanages, opening sectoral orphanages, insulators and distributors, and placing children in foster families. The forced abandonment of children by refugee parents in order to save them from starvation has become widespread. Temporary delivery of children to peasant families for agricultural work was practiced. Bureaucratic mistakes, interdepartmental inconsistency, and local negligence led to poor provision of children with food, clothing, and medical care. Indirect data indicate high infant mortality. Many children remained in shelters in Smolensk and were not re-evacuated. Results. The archival material of the Smolensk region showed the difficulties of practical implementation of the plan of assistance to resettled families developed by the central authorities, the need for a flexible approach on the ground, and taking into account regional specifics. Funding. The study was supported by grant No. 24-18-00212 from the Russian Science Foundation “Women's family memory in Russia of the 18th and 21st centuries: forms of transmission, dynamics of transformations, social mission”. © 2025 Volgograd State University.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an earthquake experienced during pregnancy on maternal stress, depression, and perinatal outcomes. METHODS: This descriptive–comparative study was conducted between April and May 2023 in four state hospitals affiliated to the Ministry of Health with 82 mothers (affected by the earthquake=41, not affected by the earthquake=41) who gave birth. Data were obtained with the Personal Information Form, Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale, and Traumatic Stress Symptom Checklist. RESULTS: The mean age of the mothers who were earthquake affected in the study was 27.63±5.62. It was determined that earthquake-affected mothers gave birth prematurely and the birth weight of their infants was lower (p<0.05). It was determined that all of the earthquake-affected mothers experienced more stress according to the Traumatic Stress Symptom Checklist scale cut-off score (>25) and 73.2% of them showed more depressive symptoms according to the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale cut-off score (>13) (p<0.05). According to multivariate regression analysis, early gestational age and depressive symptoms were found to be risk factors for posttraumatic stress in mothers affected by the earthquake (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The study concluded that the earthquake-affected mothers showed depressive symptoms at least 6 weeks after giving birth, and all had increased levels of posttraumatic stress. © 2025 Associacao Medica Brasileira.

AB  - Background: Flood disasters are projected to increase in severity, duration, and frequency in the context of climate change, and the risks of mortality and morbidity may increase after floods, which will overwhelm health systems. Objective: This study aims to synthesize current epidemiological evidence about the impacts of floods on mortality and morbidity. Method: After performing a systematic literature search from 2000 to 2023, we included studies involving human participants, with exposures of floods, and with outcomes of mortality or morbidity. Results: In total, 37 studies were included in evidence syntheses. Meta-analyses yielded an overall relative risk of 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10, 1.46), 1.10 (1.08, 1.13), 1.11 (1.04, 1.20), and 1.38 (1.18, 1.62) for all-cause mortality and morbidities of overall gastrointestinal diseases, diarrhea diseases, and dysentery, respectively. Although meta-analyses were not conducted, evidence from at least three studies consistently supported that exposure to floods was associated with increased risks of malaria and respiratory diseases. The evidence for other outcomes was reported but either limited or uncertain. Conclusion: This study suggests that exposure to floods is associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality and morbidities of overall gastrointestinal diseases, diarrhea diseases, dysentery, malaria, and respiratory diseases, while further research is urgently called. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Pregnant people are vulnerable to air pollution exposure, including risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and stillbirth. Understanding the infiltration of outdoor wildfire smoke into a residential space is critical for the accurate assessment of wildfire smoke exposure and associated health effects in pregnant people. Relying on ambient measurements of wildfire smoke alone can result in exposure misclassification. In this study, we examine the role of physical housing characteristics in the relationship between smoke exposure and preterm birth. In particular, we examine the effect of home size, year of construction, cooling type, and renovation status, as effect modifiers in the relationship between smoke exposure during pregnancy and preterm birth from 2007 to 2015 in California. To do this, we combined data on home characteristics from the California Tax Assessor, birth outcomes from the California birth records database, and the number of smoke days for each pregnancy from theNOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Hazard Mapping System (HMS). We estimated the association between smoke day exposures and odds of preterm birth using logistic regression models and stratified by air basin and housing characteristics. Our findings reveal that cooling type and renovation status are key factors modifying the smoke exposure-preterm birth relationship. Notably, we found elevated associations for people living in unrenovated homes, those using evaporative cooling systems, and those using central air conditioning units. While we observed elevated odds of preterm birth associated with increasing smoke day exposure for residents of large and new homes, this effect does not significantly differ across home size and age quartiles. This study highlights the need to further examine the relative roles of housing characteristics as well as factors not measured here including behavioral factors, time spent outdoors, window use, and occupational exposures in driving adverse birth outcomes related to wildfire smoke exposure © 2024

AB  - Background: Landscape fire-sourced (LFS) air pollution is an increasing public health concern in the context of climate change. However, little is known about the attributable global, regional, and national mortality burden related to LFS air pollution. Methods: We calculated country-specific population-weighted average daily and annual LFS fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2·5</inf>) and surface ozone (O<inf>3</inf>) during 2000–19 from a validated dataset. We obtained the relative risks (RRs) for both short-term and long-term impact of LFS PM<inf>2·5</inf> and O<inf>3</inf> on all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. The short-term RRs were pooled from community-specific standard time-series regressions in 2267 communities across 59 countries or territories. The long-term RRs were obtained from published meta-analyses of cohort studies on all-source PM<inf>2·5</inf> and O<inf>3</inf>. Annual mortality, population, and socio-demographic data for each country or territory were extracted from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019. These data were used to estimate country-specific annual deaths attributable to LFS air pollution using standard algorithms. Findings: Globally, 1·53 million all-cause deaths per year (95% empirical confidence interval [eCI] 1·24–1·82) were attributable to LFS air pollution during 2000–19, including 0·45 million (0·32–0·57) cardiovascular deaths and 0·22 million respiratory deaths (0·08–0·35). LFS PM<inf>2·5</inf> and O<inf>3</inf> contributed to 77·6% and 22·4% of the total attributable deaths, respectively. Over 90% of all attributable deaths were in low-income and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (606 769 deaths per year), southeast Asia (206 817 deaths), south Asia (170 762 deaths), and east Asia (147 291 deaths). The global cardiovascular attributable deaths saw an average 1·67% increase per year (p<inf>trend</inf> <0·001), although the trends for all-cause and respiratory attributable deaths were not statistically significant. The five countries with the largest all-cause attributable deaths were China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, and Nigeria, although the order changed in the second decade. The leading countries with the greatest attributable mortality rates (AMRs) were all in sub-Saharan Africa, despite decreasing trends from 2000 to 2019. North and central America, and countries surrounding the Mediterranean, showed increasing trends of all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory AMRs. Increasing cardiovascular AMR was also observed in southeast Asia, south Asia, and east Asia. In 2019, the AMRs in low-income countries remained four times those in high-income countries, though this had reduced from nine times in 2000. AMRs negatively correlated with a country-specific socio-demographic index (Spearman correlation coefficients r around –0·60). Interpretation: LFS air pollution induced a substantial global mortality burden, with notable geographical and socioeconomic disparities. Urgent actions are required to address such substantial health impact and the associated environmental injustice in a warming climate.

AB  - Wildfire-specific particulate matter with diameters ≤ 2.5 µm (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) is the key component of wildfire smoke, with potentially higher toxicity than PM<inf>2.5</inf> from other sources. In this nationwide population-based cohort study, we included 22,163,195 births from Brazil during 2010–2019. Daily wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> was estimated through the chemical transport model. Time-varying Cox proportional hazards models were used to characterize the exposure-time-response (E-T-R) relationship between weekly wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposure and preterm birth (PTB) risks, followed by subgroup analyses. A 10 µg/m3 increment in wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.047 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.032–1.063) for PTB. Stronger associations between wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PTB were observed during earlier pregnancy, among female infants, and pregnant women < 18 years old, in ethnic minorities, with a length of education ≥ 11 years, from low-income or high-temperature municipalities, and residing in North/Northeast regions. An estimated 1.47 % (95 % CI: 1.01 %–1.94 %) of PTBs were attributable to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> in Brazil, increasing from 2010 to 2019. The PTBs attributable to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> surpassed those attributed to non-wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> (0.31 %, 95<inf>%</inf> CI: 0.09 %–0.57 %). Wildfire emerged as a critical source contributing to the PM<inf>2.5</inf>-linked PTBs. Prioritized fire management and emission control strategies are warranted for PTB prevention. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense on a global scale, raising concerns about their acute and long-term effects on human health. We conducted a systematic review of the current epidemiological evidence on wildfire health risks and a meta-analysis to investigate the association between wildfire smoke exposure and various health outcomes. We discovered that wildfire smoke increases the risk of premature deaths and respiratory morbidity in the general population. Meta-analysis of cause-specific mortality and morbidity revealed that wildfire smoke had the strongest associations with cardiovascular mortality (RR: 1.018, 95% CI: 1.014-1.021), asthma hospitalization (RR: 1.054, 95% CI: 1.026-1.082), and asthma emergency department visits (RR: 1.117, 95% CI: 1.035-1.204) in the general population. Subgroup analyses of age found that adults and elderly adults were more susceptible to the cardiopulmonary effects of wildfire smoke. Next, we systematically addressed the toxicological mechanisms of wildfire smoke, including direct toxicity, oxidative stress, inflammatory reactions, immune dysregulation, genotoxicity and mutations, skin allergies, inflammation, and others. We discuss wildfire smoke risk mitigation strategies including public health interventions, regulatory measures, and personal actions. We conclude by highlighting current research limitations and future directions for wildfire research, such as elucidating the complex interactions of wildfire smoke components on human health, developing personalized risk assessment tools, and improving resilience and adaptation strategies to mitigate the health effects of wildfires in changing climate. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Introduction: Large parts of Iran have a dry and semi-arid climate, which is why opportunities for fodder production in the country are limited. Providing feed from agricultural by-products, including potato vines, can be considered a suitable option to compensate for the limitations of traditional feed (e.g. alfalfa). Ardabil province has about 15-20% of the country's potato cultivation area, and with the annual production of about 800 thousand tons of potato tubers, it ranks second in the country. Therefore, there is great potential in this province to produce by-products related to potatoes. The present study was conducted to investigate the possibility and effect of replacing potato vines with regular forage in the diet of pregnant sheep (during the last 45 days of pregnancy). Materials and methods: In the first step of this research, the chemical compositions of alfalfa hay and potato vine including dry matter, organic matter, ash, crude protein, crude fat, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were determined. In the next phase, 210 pregnant Moghani sheep were randomly assigned to seven treatments with three replicates and 10 sheep per replicate. In addition to the control treatment (pasture feeding), six treatments with different levels of potato vine (zero, 16, and 32%) were used in two food forms, mash and complete block. The mentioned diets were given to the animals in the last 45 days of pregnancy in the amount of 500 grams during the night feeding time. It should be noted that lactating ewes were not subjected to any treatment after lambing and the effect of an additional feeding period on milk production was examined after three months of lambing. Results and discussion: According to the results obtained, the percentage of dry matter, crude protein, crude fat, gross energy, and ADF in potato vine was not significantly different from alfalfa feed, but the NDF percentage in potato vine was lower than alfalfa and its ash content was more than alfalfa (P<0.05). No significant difference was observed in the amount of dry matter digestibility (DMD) and dry organic matter digestibility (DOMD) between the potato vine and alfalfa hay. Ewe weight gain during the supplementary feeding period was influenced by different treatments (P<0.05). A similar pattern was observed for other traits such as ewe weight after lambing, birth weight of lambs, weight gain before weaning, and, weaning weight of lambs. In the current study, the examined traits in sheep that were fed with complete block showed better performance compared to sheep fed with mash. In this feeding method, animals are not able to choose due to the uniform composition of food, which leads to a uniform effect on the rumen and thus reduces the fluctuation in ammonia release for more efficient use of non-protein nitrogen. Complete block feeding is an efficient method to increase voluntary feed intake in ruminants. It also improves nutrient utilization by stabilizing fermentation in the rumen. The increase in birth and weaning weight in lambs whose mothers were fed complete block diets showed that the use of supplementary feeding in the last weeks of gestation of ewes, when carried out appropriately, leads to improvement in fetal growth and proper development of the mammary gland, and increase in birth weight of the lamb and milk production. The different treatments have a significant impact on the amount of milk production so that the average daily milk production throughout the lactation period was lowest in the control treatment (without using any nutritional supplements) and highest in the block feeding treatment at 16% Potato vine. The results showed that using the complete block produced a higher profit compared to the mash. Conclusions: Based on the results of the present research, the use of 16% potato vine as a replacement for part of the usual fodder in the form of a complete feed block resulted in profitability in the nomadic sheep farming system. Given the cheap price and availability compared to alfalfa fodder and wheat straw, especially in drought conditions and poor pastures, its consumption is economical. © 2024, University of Guilan.

AB  - Climate change affects human health broadly and is leading to poor population health outcomes in a number of areas. Among pregnant people specifically, it can contribute to greater risk of health complications. Certain populations are more likely to be exposed to the adverse environmental impacts of climate change, which further amplifies existing health inequities in the United States, including in maternal health. Nurses who work in emergent, acute, and critical care settings must be prepared to care for individuals who are pregnant and experiencing medical emergencies as a result of exposure to extreme heat, air pollution, natural disasters, and infectious diseases that are direct consequences of climate change. To this end, nurses must be ready to recognize, treat, and manage pregnancy complications arising from climate-related conditions, as well as provide patient education on future mitigation strategies and advocacy to reduce its harms. © 2024 American Association of Critical-Care Nurses.

AB  - Floods are becoming more frequent and severe in the context of climate change, with major impacts on human health. However, their effect on infant mortality remains unknown, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a sibling-matched case-control study using individual-level data from Demographic and Health Surveys in Africa during 1990–2020. Individual flood experience was determined by matching the residential coordinates with flood events from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory database. Using data from 514,760 newborns, we found increased risks of infant mortality associated with flood exposure across multiple periods, with the risks remaining elevated for up to four years after the flood event. Overall, flood exposure was associated with 3.42 infant deaths per 1000 births in Africa from 2000 to 2020, approximately 1.7 times the burden associated with life-period exposure. This multi-country study in Africa provides novel evidence that flood events may increase infant mortality risk and burden, even over years after exposure. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Australia’s 2019/20 bushfire season was one of the most severe on record, from both land mass burned and the economic impact. This extreme weather season allowed the researchers to examine the effect of high PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposure during high bushfire days on birthweight and gestational age. It is well known that bushfire smoke is harmful to human health. However, the impact this has on the developing fetus is not yet clear. 25,346 births were assessed, their exposure calculated based on location data, and outcomes analyzed. Mothers exposed to high PM<inf>2.5</inf> (measured by a 24-hour average PM<inf>2.5</inf> greater than 25 µg/m3) demonstrated a significant birthweight reduction of 0.77 g per day of exposure. Those who were also self-identified as having smoked at any time during their pregnancy were at higher risk, with a 1.33 g reduction in birthweight per day of exposure. Gestational age was reduced by 0.01 days per day of exposure in the total cohort, with no significant difference demonstrated in those who smoked. The compounded effects of high PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposure may result in birthweight reduction, with neonates born to mothers who smoked at increased risk. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Floods have affected billions worldwide. Yet, the indirect health impacts of floods on vulnerable groups, particularly women in the developing world, remain underexplored. Here, we evaluated the risk of pregnancy loss for women exposed to floods. We analyzed 90,465 individual pregnancy loss records from 33 developing countries, cross-referencing each with spatial-temporal flood databases. We found that gestational flood exposure is associated with increased pregnancy loss with an odds ratio of 1.08 (95% confidence interval: 1.04 - 1.11). This risk is pronounced for women outside the peak reproductive age range (<21 or >35) or during the mid and late-stage of pregnancy. The risk escalated for women dependent on surface water, with lower income or education levels. We estimated that, over the 2010s, gestational flood events might be responsible for approximately 107,888 (CIs: 53,944 - 148,345) excess pregnancy losses annually across 33 developing countries. Notably, there is a consistent upward trend in annual excess pregnancy losses from 2010 to 2020, and was more prominent over Central America, the Caribbean, South America, and South Asia. Our findings underscore the disparities in maternal and child health aggravated by flood events in an evolving climate. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - In the southwestern United States, the frequency of summer wildfires has elevated ambient PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations and rates of adverse birth outcomes. Notably, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) constitute a significant determinant associated with maternal mortality and adverse birth outcomes. Despite the accumulating body of evidence, scant research has delved into the correlation between chemical components of wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> and the risk of HDP. Derived from data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics, singleton births from >2.68 million pregnant women were selected across 8 states (Arizona, AZ; California, CA, Idaho, ID, Montana, MT; Nevada, NV; Oregon, OR; Utah, UT, and Wyoming, WY) in the southwestern US from 2001 to 2004. A spatiotemporal model and a Goddard Earth Observing System chemical transport model were employed to forecast daily concentrations of total and wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf>-derived exposure. Various modeling techniques including unadjusted analyses, covariate-adjusted models, propensity-score matching, and double robust typical logit models were applied to assess the relationship between wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposure and gestational hypertension and eclampsia. Exposure to fire PM<inf>2.5</inf>, fire-sourced black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) were associated with an augmented risk of gestational hypertension (OR<inf>PM2.5</inf> = 1.125, 95 % CI: 1.109,1.141; OR<inf>BC</inf> = 1.247, 95 % CI: 1.214,1.281; OR<inf>OC</inf> = 1.153, 95 % CI: 1.132, 1.174) and eclampsia (OR<inf>PM2.5</inf> = 1.217, 95 % CI: 1.145,1.293; OR<inf>BC</inf> = 1.458, 95 % CI: 1.291,1.646; OR<inf>OC</inf> = 1.309, 95 % CI: 1.208,1.418) during the pregnancy exposure window with the strongest effect. The associations were stronger that the observed effects of ambient PM<inf>2.5</inf> in which the sources primarily came from urban emissions. Social vulnerability index (SVI), education years, pre-pregnancy diabetes, and hypertension acted as effect modifiers. Gestational exposure to wildfire PM2.5 and specific chemical components (BC and OC) increased gestational hypertension and eclampsia risk in the southwestern United States. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the association between drinking water pollutants and non-syndromic birth defects. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis synthesis. Data sources A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar was performed to review relevant citations reporting on birth defects in pregnancies exposed to water pollutants between January 1962 and April 2023. Eligibility criteria Prospective or retrospective cohort, population studies and case-control studies that provided data on exposure to drinking water pollutants around conception or during pregnancy and non-syndromic birth defects. We included studies published in the English language after the Minamata Bay disaster to reflect on contemporary concerns about the effect of environmental pollution and obstetric outcomes. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers independently read the retrieved articles for content, data extraction and analysis. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Included studies were assessed for comparability when considered for meta-analysis. Results 32 studies met inclusion criteria including 17 cohorts (6 389 097 participants) and 15 case-control studies (47 914 cases and 685 712 controls). The most common pollutants investigated were trihalomethanes (11 studies), arsenic (5 studies) and nitrates (4 studies). The studies varied in design with different estimates of exposure, different stages of gestation age and different durations of exposure to pollutants. 21 articles reported data on any birth defects in their population or study groups and the others on specific birth defects including congenital heart defects, neural tube defects, orofacial defects and hypospadias. An increased risk or higher incidence of overall birth defects was reported by 9 studies and for specific birth defects by 14 studies. Eight studies compared the risk or incidence of birth defects with exposure to different concentrations of the pollutants. The analysis showed an association between higher levels of trihalomethanes (TTMs) and arsenic increase in major birth defects (lower vs higher exposure (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.89; p<0.001 and OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.82; p<0.005, respectively). Conclusion The evidence of an association between exposure to average levels of common drinking water chemical pollutants during pregnancy and an increased risk or incidence of birth defects is uncertain. Available evidence indicates that some common chemical pollutants currently found in drinking water may have a direct teratogenic effect at high maternal exposure, however, wide variation in methodology limits the interpretation of the results. Future prospective studies using standardised protocols comparing maternal levels during all three trimesters of pregnancy and cord blood levels at birth are needed to better understand the placental transfer of water pollutants and accurately evaluate individual fetal exposure to drinking water pollutants.

AB  - The review examines how climate change adversely affects maternal health and pregnancy outcomes in Africa, a region particularly vulnerable to climate-related disasters. It highlights the increased incidence of tropical and waterborne illnesses due to climate change, disproportionately impacting expectant mothers. The study thoroughly evaluates the effects of extreme weather events like heatwaves and floods on maternal health, both directly and indirectly. It underscores significant gaps in policy and research within African health sectors regarding these issues. Key findings reveal that maternal death rates remain alarmingly high, with risks like preterm birth, stillbirth, and maternal hypertension exacerbated by climate change. The review calls for urgent action, including enhanced research, increased funding for climate adaptation, and the integration of maternal health into broader climate resilience strategies. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for greater awareness and international collaboration to strengthen health systems in Africa, particularly addressing the vulnerabilities of pregnant women. This work aims to enhance understanding among policymakers and researchers about the critical health impacts of climate change on pregnant women in Africa. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Relative to other Oregon counties, Klamath County experiences worse air quality due to wildfire smoke, as well as elevated rates of infant mortality and low birthweight. Klamath County Public Health (KCPH) raised concerns that wildfire smoke is a contributor to poor infant health. Thus, we built a multidisciplinary team and designed a community-engaged research (CEnR) project to capture community and individual-level exposure to wildfire smoke contaminants, alongside perinatal health outcomes. Through partnerships, we identified 24 individuals across academic, public health, and community organizations that met five times over three months to develop a study design. We initially used a modified Delphi method, but adjusted our approach to find multidisciplinary areas of agreement across a highly diverse team. Our team used structured meetings, surveys, and iterative feedback to build consensus on a study design. KCPH and our community partners reviewed and approved all proposed activities to ensure community input was integrated. The resultant study, trialed in Klamath County, included the use of environmental, residential, and personal samplers and health surveys with a cohort of pregnant individuals during the wildfire season. We discuss the advantages and challenges of building a multidisciplinary CEnR study in a rural county disproportionately impacted by wildfire smoke and infant mortality. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background Extreme weather is a recognised risk factor for stillbirth and preterm birth, disrupts women’s access to healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth, and negatively affects the care of newborns. Reliable and accessible heat and weather warning systems are key in alerting individuals to undertake protective measures. There is a notable gap in understanding how women and caregivers in rural East Africa perceive and utilize weather information. We investigated community members’ heat and weather warning information-seeking behaviour, identified available sources, assessed their reliability and utility, and examined their influence on behaviour. Settings Our research was conducted in rural Kilifi County in Kenya’s coastal region. The area experiences temperatures exceeding 23̊C throughout the year, with extended periods of extreme temperatures [> 40̊C] and long and severe droughts. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews [IDI] with pregnant and postpartum women [n = 21] and held six focus group discussions [FGDs] involving mothers-in-law and community health volunteers [CHVs]. The data were analysed in NVivo 12 using both inductive and deductive approaches. Results We found significant gaps concerning pregnant and post-partum women, and their caregivers, having timely access to weather forecasts and heat information from health or meteorological authorities. Information on heat and weather warnings is disseminated through various channels, including television, radio, mobile phones, and word of mouth, which are facilitated by community influencers such as CHVs and local chiefs. Indigenous methods of weather forecasting, such as cloud observation, consulting local “rainmakers”, and studying the behavioural patterns of amphibians, are employed in conjunction with warnings from the Kenyan Meteorological Department (KMD). Barriers to accessing weather information include the cost of television and smartphones and a lack of segmented information in local languages. Conclusions National and county meteorological services need to enhance public participation, communication, and the delivery of heat and weather information to guide community-level response measures and individual behaviour change. They should also collaborate with health professionals to address heat risks for vulnerable groups. Further research is needed to empower indigenous weather predictors with modern weather information and revise national policies to deliver tailored messages to vulnerable populations like pregnant and postpartum women. © 2024 Lusambili et al.

AB  - IMPORTANCE The associations of exposure to fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and its constituents with spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) remain understudied. Identifying subpopulations at increased risk characterized by socioeconomic status and other environmental factors is critical for targeted interventions. OBJECTIVE To examine associations of PM<inf>2.5</inf> and its constituents with sPTB. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2008 to 2018 within a large integrated health care system, Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Singleton live births with recorded residential information of pregnant individuals during pregnancy were included. Data were analyzed from December 2023 to March 2024. EXPOSURES Daily total PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations and monthly data on 5 PM<inf>2.5</inf> constituents (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, organic matter, and black carbon) in California were assessed, and mean exposures to these pollutants during pregnancy and by trimester were calculated. Exposures to total green space, trees, low-lying vegetation, and grass were estimated using street view images. Wildfire-related exposure was measured by the mean concentration of wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> during pregnancy. Additionally, the mean exposure to daily maximum temperature during pregnancy was calculated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was sPTB identified through a natural language processing algorithm. Discrete-time survival models were used to estimate associations of total PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration and its 5 constituents with sPTB. Interaction terms were used to examine the effect modification by race and ethnicity, educational attainment, household income, and exposures to green space, wildfire smoke, and temperature. RESULTS Among 409 037 births (mean [SD] age of mothers at delivery, 30.3 [5.8] years), there were positive associations of PM<inf>2.5</inf>, black carbon, nitrate, and sulfate with sPTB. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) per IQR increase were 1.15 (95% CI, 1.12-1.18; P < .001) for PM<inf>2.5</inf> (IQR, 2.76 μg/m3), 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11-1.20; P < .001) for black carbon (IQR, 1.05 μg/m3), 1.09 (95% CI, 1.06-1.13; P < .001) for nitrate (IQR, 0.93 μg/m3), and 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03-1.09; P < .001) for sulfate (IQR, 0.40 μg/m3) over the entire pregnancy. The second trimester was the most susceptible window; for example, aORs for total PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration were 1.07 (95% CI, 1.05-1.09; P < .001) in the first, 1.10 (95% CI, 1.08-1.12; P < .001) in the second, and 1.09 (95% CI, 1.07-1.11; P < .001) in the third trimester. Significantly higher aORs were observed among individuals with lower educational attainment (eg, less than college: aOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.12-1.21 vs college [≥4 years]: aOR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.06-1.14; P = .03) or income (<50th percentile: aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.14-1.21 vs ≥50th percentile: aOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.16; P = .02) or who were exposed to limited green space (<50th percentile: aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.15-1.23 vs ≥50th percentile: aOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.15; P = .003), more wildfire smoke (≥50th percentile: aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.16-1.23 vs <50th percentile: aOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.09-1.16; P = .009), or extreme heat (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.42-1.59 vs mild temperature: aOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.09-1.14; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, exposures to PM<inf>2.5</inf> and specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> constituents during pregnancy were associated with increased odds of sPTB. Socioeconomic status and other environmental exposures modified this association. © 2024 Jiao A et al.

AB  - Background: High-risk pregnancies and birth defects are often greater within communities of color where resources for a healthy pregnancy are generally lacking. Infant and maternal mortality, preterm birth, and instances of increased developmental and physical defects are related to environmental exposures (e.g., pesticides, lead in water, wildfire smoke), dietary additives, and lack of access to adequate healthcare. More frequently people of color and other under-served groups, are affected by historical inequality and unconscious bias. Compounding these disparities, research into these issues and efforts to address them are poorly supported. Methods: The speakers in this symposium presented evidence for health disparities within communities of color to foster research aimed at identifying toxic levels of potentially hazardous dietary chemicals, or exposures in the pediatric population can focus on addressing the current inadequacy of translating scientific findings into enforceable policies. Results: The disparities discussed within this symposium highlighted key areas in desperate need of policy reform. In the United States, regulatory exposure levels have been established for lead exposures but frequently exceed these limits without mitigation. Neural tube defects can be prevented by a simple dietary solution such as fortification of staple foods with folic acid. Recent literature on gender as a social determinant of health has determined women suffer more negative health consequences due to social attitudes. Conclusions: Ultimately, this symposium provided an understanding of the experience of disadvantaged and marginalized persons during pregnancy, illustrated the disparities that exist in reproductive health, and described the need to address and prevent them. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Emergency nursing in Gaza's war zone presents innumerable challenges when caring for female patients in a depleted health care system. Negative health outcomes specifically impact women of all ages due to lack of access to menstrual products, prenatal and primary care, private bathrooms, medication, essential nutrition, and clean water. The massive destruction of infrastructure and consequent internal displacement of millions has led to a rise in infectious diseases. The few remaining functional hospitals depend heavily on foreign medical delegations for supplies, which results in a lack of standardized treatment for women's health complaints. Emergency departments must also navigate overcrowding, lack of basic supplies and specialists, and prioritization of daily mass casualty incidents from nearby explosions. These obstacles make treatment, discharge teaching, and follow-up care for women's health difficult to implement. Despite these arduous circumstances, Gazan health care professionals find innovative solutions to improve outcomes and reduce harm while honoring the cultural and religious preferences of their female patients. © 2024 Emergency Nurses Association

AB  - Abstract: A “one health” approach recognises that human health, animal health and planetary health are closely interlinked and that a transdisciplinary approach is required to fully understand and maintain global health. While, by necessity, Neonatal Intensive Care has traditionally focused on the acutely unwell newborn, the avoidance of long-term harm is core to many management decisions. The COVID 19 pandemic and climate crisis have brought into sharp relief the importance of a “one health” approach as part of long-term health promotion in the holistic care of neonates, who may survive to experience the burden of future environmental crises. This narrative review seeks to integrate what we know about “one health” issues in the neonatal intensive care unit, notably antimicrobial resistance and climate change, and suggest “everyday changes” which can be utilised by practitioners to minimise the impact of neonatal intensive care on these global health issues. Many of the changes suggested not only represent important improvements for planetary health but are also core to good neonatal practice. Impact: Neonatal patients are likely to bear the burden of future environmental crises including pandemics and climate related disasters. While the focus of intensive care practitioners is acute illness, awareness of “one health” problems are important for our smallest patients as part of preventing long-term harm. High quality neonatal care can benefit both the planet and our patients. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Introduction: Pregnancy increases vulnerability to environmental stressors. Climate change heightens risks for pregnant women, leading to adverse maternal and infant outcomes. Coastal regions, prone to sea-level rise, rising temperatures, saltwater intrusion, and extreme weather, face significant health impacts. This review summarises the effects of climate change on pregnant women in these areas, emphasising the need for targeted interventions to mitigate these risks. Discussion: This scoping review was conducted using the advanced Arksey and O’Malley framework. Utilizing several keywords, including 'climate change,' 'adverse pregnancy,' 'pregnant outcome,' 'coastal,' and 'island,' a thorough exploration was conducted on PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus and ProQuest. A thorough review of 660 articles from 2020–2024 on those online databases identified 34 relevant studies. The findings show that coastal residents face environmental challenges such as rising temperatures, air pollution, cyclones, hurricanes, ozone exposure, floods, and highly saline water. Prolonged exposure to these conditions exacerbates health risks. Climate change is linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight, small gestational age, stillbirth, preterm birth, neonatal health problems, and increased the risk of pregnancy complications and miscarriages. Conclusion: Climate change significantly affects pregnant women, causing complications and adverse outcomes throughout pregnancy. Addressing these issues requires comprehensive policies and intervention programs. These insights provide a foundation for policymakers to develop strategies that support and protect pregnant women in vulnerable regions. Household-level efforts, such as providing a comfortable living environment, can help reduce the climate change impacts. © 2024 Jurnal Kesehatan Lingkungan all right reserved.

AB  - This research explores the intricate relationship between climate change and reproductive health through an analysis of 1000 global news articles from 2018 onwards. Utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), key topics in media coverage are identified, encompassing fertility challenges, pregnancy complications, infectious diseases, maternal and infant health in disasters, gender-based violence, healthcare access inequities, mental health impacts, and food security issues. Findings reveal an uneven distribution of coverage across continents, with potential language bias in English-dominated sources. Acknowledging limitations, future research directions emphasize a more inclusive approach, incorporating diverse linguistic perspectives and qualitative exploration of community experiences. The study underscores the imperative for global representation in media discourse and advocates for comprehensive, evidence-based strategies to address the complex interplay between climate change and reproductive health.

AB  - Background Climate change and extreme weather events significantly threaten neonatal and child health. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence on the impact of climate change on child health, using the evidence gap map (EGM) to address knowledge gaps and establish a foundation for evidence-based interventions and future research. Method From inception, academic databases (such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, CINAHL and Scopus) and grey literature were systematically searched. We included climate change-related studies involving children aged 0-5 worldwide. Covidence facilitated a rigorous screening process, and we conducted a critical appraisal. Two independent reviewers handled screening and data extraction. Eligible studies underwent coding and extraction using Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (EPPI) reviewer software. The EGM was constructed using EPPI Mapper, and comprehensive findings were presented through live links and figures. Result We identified 196 studies, comprising 59.2% children and 40.8% neonates, with diverse research approaches, including 94% quantitative studies. There has been a notable increase in research publications over the past 5 years. Evidence is heavily concentrated in Asia (93 studies) and Africa (47 studies). The most frequently studied exposures are those related to extreme climate events, followed by drought and floods. However, there are gaps in the study of extreme cold and storms. The significant outcomes comprised preterm birth (55 studies), low birth weight (27 studies), malnutrition (59 studies) and diarrhoeal diseases (28 studies). Evidence on mental health problems and congenital disabilities receives relatively less attention. Conclusion This EGM is crucial for researchers, policymakers and practitioners. It highlights knowledge gaps and guides future research to address the evolving threats of climate change to global child health.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has become a multidimensional disaster, affecting various countries, including Indonesia. Adaptation is crucial in addressing the physical and mental health challenges within communities, which includes the adaptation of pregnant women who are preparing for childbirth amidst the pandemic with the aim of reducing maternal mortality rates in Indonesia. This research aimed to assess the impact of self-hypnosis on the anxiety levels and self-efficacy of pregnant women preparing for childbirth during COVID-19. The study utilized a quasi-experimental design with pre-test and post-test measures. It involved 30 respondents in both the control and intervention groups, who were selected through consecutive sampling. Anxiety levels were measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), while self-efficacy was assessed with the New General Self-Efficacy Scale. Data analysis employed paired t-tests and independent t-tests, with the significance level set at p<0.05. The results indicated a significant difference in anxiety levels and self-efficacy between the control and intervention groups, with a p-value of 0.000. Regular self-hypnosis practice positively influenced both anxiety levels and self-efficacy among pregnant women preparing for childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic. © the Author(s), 2024.

AB  - Pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction (FGR) continue to cause unacceptably high levels of morbidity and mortality, despite significant pharmaceutical and technological advances in other disease areas. The recent pandemic has also impacted obstetric care, as COVID-19 infection increases the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes. This review explores the reasons why it lacks effective drug treatments for the placental dysfunction that underlies many common obstetric conditions and describes how nanomedicines and targeted drug delivery approaches may provide the solution to the current drug drought. The ever-increasing range of biocompatible nanoparticle formulations available is now making it possible to selectively deliver drugs to uterine and placental tissues and dramatically limit fetal drug transfer. Formulations that are refractory to placental uptake offer the possibility of retaining drugs within the maternal circulation, allowing pregnant individuals to take medicines previously considered too harmful to the developing baby. Liposomes, ionizable lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, and adenoviral vectors have all been used to create efficacious drug delivery systems for use in pregnancy, although each approach offers distinct advantages and limitations. It is imperative that recent advances continue to be built upon and that there is an overdue investment of intellectual and financial capital in this field. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The unpredicted natural or human-made calamity that always leads to huge destruction to the existence of flora, fauna, individuals, populations, and the environment is termed a Disaster. The consequences of a disaster are found to be extensive and can distress individuals, communities, and even entire nations. The impact of disasters mostly leads to injuries, demises, physical disability, burns, epidemics, weakness, physical illness, lack of sanitation, miscarriage, reproductive health, fatigue, and lack of sleep and appetite. This chapter describes the fundamentals of disaster, risks and hazards, vulnerability, threats to sustainable development, history of disaster, and the present scenario of the disaster through examples and case studies of recent disasters around the globe. Natural disasters are geological, hydrological, climatological, meteorological, biological, and universe-related calamities, food insecurity, epidemics and pandemics, and displaced populations whereas human-made disasters are environmental degradation, pollution, terrorism, and other accidents. The basic elements of disaster management such as prevention, mitigation, preparedness, responses, and recovery need to be researched from time to time. The studies represent new approaches involving drones and artificial intelligence towards the future of disaster management. © 2024 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper investigates how climate change and poverty affect child health inequality across 63 provinces in Vietnam from 2006 to 2023. By examining deaths and economic losses from storms and floods, we assess climate change’s impact; while, infant mortality rate (IMR) and under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) serve as indicators of child health inequality. Findings reveal that climate change directly worsens child health inequality and exacerbates it indirectly by increasing poverty. Notably, the effects on U5MR are more pronounced than on IMR. Additionally, child vaccinations, healthcare infrastructure, and access to clean water are vital in reducing health disparities and mitigating climate change’s harmful effects on child health. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Among the frequent congenital anomalies of teeth, the labio-cervical vertical groove (LCVG) is a rare congenital morphological anomaly of teeth. The science of forensic dentistry has valuable contributions to assist in personal identification, syndromic correlation of congenital diseases, victim search after a mass disaster by ensuring faster and scientific information from recorded secure past data to compare it with the present one. Infolding of an enamel organ and Hertwig’s epithelial root sheath can create a vertical groove on the labial surface of permanent maxillary incisors extending from crown to root. A 47-year-old male patient, came to a private clinic with a complaint of bleeding from gums. On clinical examination, generalized mild gingival inflammation and vertical groove along with mild gingival irregularity were found on the labial surface of 21. The present case shows mamelon remnants extension with LCVG in 21 in the patient and his mother. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - With the uncontrolled expansion of large cities and the development of industries, air pollution has become a serious issue in urban management. In recent years, repeated droughts and widespread dam construction in neighboring countries have turned the problem of dust particles into a major challenge for Iran and other countries in the region. In many large cities, the concentration of air pollutants exceeds standards, which has widespread negative effects on human health, including an increase in cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, diabetes, hypertension, dementia, miscarriages, and premature deaths. Air pollution also negatively impacts the health of other living organisms, economic and social activities, agriculture, and the environment. The most important air pollutants include suspended particles with a diameter of less than 10 and 2.5 microns, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen monoxide, sodium sulfate, carbon monoxide, and ozone. In this research, we first examine the issue of air pollution in Lorestan province based on data collected from the air pollution monitoring stations of the Environmental Protection Organization, and we calculate the correlation between the concentration of air pollutants and meteorological variables. Then, we use a multilayer neural network with a stable online learning algorithm to predict short-term pollutant concentration levels. Predicting air pollution is of high importance, and timely predictions can be effective in reducing the negative effects of air pollution. There are various methods for predicting air pollution, some of which have low accuracy. However, the use of artificial neural networks, as a more advanced method, has recently gained attention for modeling and predicting air quality. These models are especially useful for predicting time series and environmental data. Considering the quality of data collected at the air pollution monitoring stations of the Environmental Protection Organization in Lorestan province, the significant impacts of the dust phenomenon, and the geographical locations of the cities of Khorramabad and Poldokhtar, these cities were selected for case studies. According to the obtained results, there is a significant correlation between meteorological variables and pollutant concentrations, and the proposed neural network model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting pollutant concentrations. © 2024, Islamic Republic of Iran Meteorological Organisation.

AB  - Background: Epidemiological evidence on the association between wildfire-specific fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and its carbonaceous components with perinatal outcomes is limited. We aimed to examine the short-term effects of wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> and its carbonaceous components on perinatal outcomes. Methods: A multicentre cohort of 9743 singleton births during the wildfire seasons from 1 September 2009 to 31 December 2015 across six cities in New South Wales, Australia were linked with daily wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> and carbonaceous components (organic carbon and black carbon). Adjusted distributed lag Cox regression models with spatial clustering were performed to estimate daily and cumulative adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) during the last four gestational weeks for preterm birth, stillbirth, nonvertex presentation, low 5-min Apgar score, special care nursery/neonatal intensive care unit (SCN/NICU) admission, and caesarean section. Results: Daily aHRs per 10 µg/m3 PM<inf>2.5</inf> showed nearly inverted ‘U’-shaped positive associations and daily cumulative aHRs that increased with increasing duration of the exposures. The aHRs for lag 0–6 days were 1.17 (95 % CI: 1.04, 1.32) for preterm birth, 1.40 (95 % CI: 1.11, 1.78) for stillbirth, 1.20 (95 % CI: 1.08, 1.33) for nonvertex presentation, 1.12 (95 % CI: 0.93, 1.35) for low 5-min Apgar score, 0.99 (95 % CI: 0.83, 1.19) for SNC/NICU admission, and 1.01 (95 % CI: 0.94, 1.08) for caesarean section. Organic carbon and black carbon components for lag 0–6 days showed positive associations. The highest component-specific aHRs were 1.09 (95 % CI: 1.03, 1.15) and 4.57 (95 % CI: 1.96, 10.68) for stillbirth per 1 µg/m3 organic carbon and black carbon, respectively. The subgroups identified as most vulnerable were female births, births to mothers with low socioeconomic status, and births to mothers with high biothermal exposure. Conclusions: Positive associations of short-term wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposure and its carbonaceous components with adverse perinatal outcomes suggest that policies to reduce exposure would benefit public health. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - OBJECTIVE To evaluate associations of wildfire fine particulate matter ≤2.5 mm in diameter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) with diabetes across multiple countries and territories. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We collected data on 3,612,135 diabetes hospitalizations from 1,008 locations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, Thailand, and Taiwan during 2000–2019. Daily wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> levels were estimated through chemical transport models and machine-learning calibration. Quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear models and random-effects meta-analysis were applied to estimate associations between wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> and diabetes hospitalization. Subgroup analyses were by age, sex, location income level, and country or territory. Diabetes hospitalizations attributable to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> and nonwildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> were compared. RESULTS Each 10 mg/m3 increase in wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> levels over the current day and previous 3 days was associated with relative risks (95% CI) of 1.017 (1.011–1.022), 1.023 (1.011–1.035), 1.023 (1.015–1.032), 0.962 (0.823–1.032), 1.033 (1.001–1.066), and 1.013 (1.004–1.022) for all-cause, type 1, type 2, malnutrition-related, other specified, and unspecified diabetes hospitalization, respectively. Stronger associations were observed for all-cause, type 1, and type 2 diabetes in Thailand, Australia, and Brazil; unspecified diabetes in New Zealand; and type 2 diabetes in high-income locations. An estimate of 0.67% (0.16–1.18%) and 1.02% (0.20–1.81%) for all-cause and type 2 diabetes hospitalizations were attributable to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Compared with nonwildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf>, wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> posed greater risks of all-cause, type 1, and type 2 diabetes and were responsible for 38.7% of PM<inf>2.5</inf>-related diabetes hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS We show the relatively underappreciated links between diabetes and wildfire air pollution, which can lead to a nonnegligible proportion of PM<inf>2.5</inf>-related diabetes hospitalizations. Precision prevention and mitigation should be developed for those in advantaged communities and in Thailand, Australia, and Brazil. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - Background: Epidemiological and economic literature has revealed that low birth weight (LBW) is related to poor health conditions and a broader range of negative socio-economic outcomes, including academic achievement, income levels, and working status. However, Japanese evidence for labor outcomes is particularly lacking, as is the question of whether the impact of LBW on adulthood worsens when disasters occur. We aimed to reveal the impact on LBW on labor outcomes during the disaster recovery phase. Methods: We used a cross-sectional data set of 4156 national health insurance holders, males aged 40–60 years, from the Miyagi and Iwate prefectures during the earthquake recovery phase. Employing a multinomial probit and logistic model, we estimated the impact of LBW on the employment status, changes in income, and the propensity to face a decline in income with a job change. Results: The very low birth weights (VLBWs) have a disadvantage in all labor market outcomes. Compared to the non-LBWs, the VLBWs were 15.2% less likely to be full-time/self-employed and 17.1% more likely to be contingent/temporary/part-time workers. Moreover, 32.9% are more likely to face a decline in income and approximately 3.7 times more likely to change jobs leading to income decline. The LBWs were likely to face a decline in income by 8.6% and 4.6%, respectively, but no other significant effects were found on other outcomes. Conclusions: The effects were apparent for the VLBW, but not so much for the LBW. The effects became larger during the disaster recovery phase, even though the regional economies were boosted. © 2024 The Author(s). Public Health Challenges published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This paper discusses the various analyses of the Trinity Nuclear Test, including how they might apply to the issue of infant mortality. This paper was first drafted as a response to a letter by Rice, who commented on my earlier letter on that issue. My earlier letter commented on the National Cancer Institute's 2020 series of papers in the October Issue of Health Physics on the impact of the Trinity Nuclear Test that was conducted on unoccupied government lands on 16 July 1945. The Journal editors requested that my response to Rice be edited and submitted as a paper to ensure adequate technical review and suggested that the article also add material summarizing the series of exchanges that were published in the Journal. This article suggests that significant differences exist between various summaries of the offsite impact of the Trinity Nuclear Test and offers that Trinity might be the largest nuclear accident in terms of the impact on uninvolved civilians who were downwind following the test. It suggests areas for further study to resolve these significant differences. It also asserts that until the estimated exposures of downwind residents are resolved and an appropriate study is made of infant deaths following the Trinity Nuclear Test, the issue of infant mortality remains an unanswered, 80-y-old question. © 2024 Health Physics Society.

AB  - Climate change poses a significant threat to women’s health in sub-Saharan Africa, yet the impact of climate change on maternal health is rarely reported in the region. Using an existing Maternal Surveillance Platform (MATSurvey), we estimated the immediate impact of Cyclone Freddy on maternal health care service indicators in Malawi. We analysed facility-level data for pregnant women up to 42 weeks post-partum using the national MATSurvey database. We compared incidences of service utilisation before (1 January to 19 February 2023) and after (20 February to 30 March 2023) the cyclone using a negative binomial regression approach. Between 1 January and 30 March 2023, a total of 37,445 live births, 50,048 antenatal clinic attendances, 23,250 postnatal clinic attendances, 84 maternal deaths, and 1,166 neonatal deaths were recorded by 33 facilities in the MatSurvey database. There was an immediate reduction in service utilisation in the post-cyclone period, including the postnatal attendance per week (pre-cyclone median: 355.0 [IQR 279.0–552.0], post-cyclone median: 261.0 [IQR 154.3–305.5], RR 0.56 [95% CI 0.44–0.71, p <0.001]) and the antenatal attendance per week (pre-cyclone median: 860.0 [IQR 756.5–1060.0], post-cyclone median: 656.5 [IQR 486.5–803.3], RR 0.66 [95% CI 0.55–0.78, p <0.001]). Stratified analyses by geographical zones revealed a stronger reduction in postnatal clinic attendance in the Southwest (RR 0.50 [95% CI 0.29–0.85, p = 0.010]) and the North (RR 0.29 [95% CI 0.15–0.56, p <0.001]). Cyclone Freddy resulted in an immediate decline in utilisation of maternal health services in cyclone-affected regions in Malawi. We observe evidence of catastrophic climate events impacting on the healthcare of women and their babies. Policymakers, researchers, and health systems need to ensure that essential women’s health services are maintained during these events and improve measures to support service resilience in the face of climate change. © 2024 Twabi et al.

AB  - Climate change poses unique challenges to maternal well-being and increases complications during pregnancy and childbirth globally. This evidence gap map (EGM) aims to identify gaps in existing knowledge and areas where further research related to climate change and its impact on maternal health is required. The following databases were searched individually from inception to present: Medline, EMBASE, and Global Health via OVID; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCOhost; Scopus; and organizational websites. In this EGM, we integrated 133 studies published in English, including qualitative, quantitative, reviews and grey literature that examined the impact of climate change on maternal health (women aged 15–45). We used Covidence to screen studies and Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (Eppi reviewer)/Eppi Mapper software to generate the EGM. Data extraction and qualitative appraisal of the studies was done using critical appraisal tools. The study protocol was registered in International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY) # INPLASY202370085. Out of 133 included studies, forty seven studies were of high quality, seventy nine moderate equality and seven low quality. This EGM found notable gaps in the literature regarding the distribution of research across regions. We found significant research in North America (51) and Asia (40 studies). However, Africa and the Caribbean had fewer studies, highlighting potential disparities in research attention and resources. Moreover, while the impact of extreme heat emerged as a prominent factor impacting maternal well-being, there is a need for further investigation into other climate-related factors such as drought. Additionally, while preterm stillbirth and maternal mortality have gained attention, there is an overlook of malnutrition and food insecurity indicators that require attention in future research. The EGM identifies existing research gaps in climate change and maternal health. It emphasizes the need for global collaboration and targeted interventions to address disparities and inform climate-responsive policies. © 2024 Meherali et al.

AB  - Floods, storms, and temperature extremes are examples of extreme weather events that have a substantial influence on a country's demographic dynamics, including migration, fertility, and mortality. Changes in population size, composition, and distribution may result from these occurrences. This study, which spans the years 1966–2018, looks at how Bangladesh's total fertility rate (TFR) is affected by extreme weather events and child mortality, including neonatal, infant, male infant, and under-five mortality. We use data from secondary publicly accessible sources, such as the World Bank and The Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), and we investigate the correlations using the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), complemented by bivariate and multivariable analyses. Our findings from the univariate analysis are noteworthy. Total extreme climate events (β = −0.345, 95 % CI: 0.510, −0.180), as well as individual extreme climate events, such as extreme temperatures (β = −1.176, 95 % CI: 1.88, −0.47), floods (β = −0.644, 95 % CI: 1.0729, −0.216), and storms (β = −0.351, 95 % CI: 0.63159, −0.07154), exhibited negative associations with the TFR. Additionally, factors such as contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) (β = −0.085, 95 % CI: 0.09072, −0.07954) and gross national income (GNI) per capita (β = −0.003, 95 % CI: 0.0041123, −0.0024234) were negatively correlated with the TFR. Conversely, various categories of child mortality, namely, infants (β = 0.041, 95 % CI: 0.040474, 0.042748), males (β = 0.038, 95 % CI:0.037719, 0.039891), and under-five (β = 0.026, 95 % CI:0.025684, 0.026979) – are positively associated with TFR. Controlling for two pivotal confounding factors, time and GNI per capita, yielded consistent results in the multivariate analysis. These findings provide insight on the dual impact of extreme weather events, which can reduce TFR while also raising it through infant mortality. This phenomena may be due to the increased vulnerability of younger children in climate-event-prone areas, prompting parents to seek additional children as both a replacement for lost offspring and an insurance mechanism against future child loss. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Background: Exposure to floods might increase the risks of adverse birth outcomes. However, the current evidence is scarce, inconsistent, and has knowledge gaps. This study aims to estimate the associations of flood exposure before and during pregnancy with adverse birth outcomes and to identify susceptible exposure windows and effect modifiers. Methods: In this cohort study, we obtained all the birth records occurring in Greater Sydney, Australia, from Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2020, from the New South Wales Midwives Data Collection and in the Brisbane metropolitan region, Australia, from Jan 1, 1995, to Dec 31, 2014, from the Queensland Health Perinatal Data Collection. For each birth, residential address and historical flood information from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory were used to estimate the numbers of days with floods during five exposure windows (Pre-1 was defined as 13–24 weeks before the last menstrual period [LMP], Pre-2 was 0–12 weeks before the LMP, trimester 1 [Tri-1] was 0–12 weeks after the LMP, trimester 2 [Tri-2] was 13–28 weeks after the LMP, and trimester 3 [Tri-3] was ≥29 weeks after the LMP). We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) of adverse birth outcomes (preterm births, stillbirths, term low birthweight [TLBW], and small for gestational age [SGA]) associated with flood exposures in the five exposure windows using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Findings: 1 338 314 birth records were included in our analyses, which included 91 851 (6·9%) preterm births, 9831 (0·7%) stillbirths, 25 567 (1·9%) TLBW, and 108 658 (8·1%) SGA. Flood exposure in Pre-1 was associated with increased risks of TLBW (HR 1·06 [95% CI 1·01–1·12]) and SGA (1·04 [1·01–1·06]); flood exposure during Tri-1 was associated with increased risks of preterm births (1·03 [1·002–1·05]), stillbirth (1·11 [1·03–1·20]), and SGA (1·03 [1·01–1·06]). In contrast, flood exposures during Pre-2 and Tri-3 were associated with reduced risks. Interpretation: Exposures to floods in Pre-1 and Tri-1 are both associated with increased risks of adverse birth outcomes, and the risks increase with a higher exposure. Upon planning for conception and prenatal care, individuals and health practitioners should raise awareness of the increased risks of adverse birth outcomes after experiencing floods.

AB  - In this article we review the history of key epidemiological studies of populations exposed to ionizing radiation. We highlight historical and recent findings regarding radiation-associated risks for incidence and mortality of cancer and non-cancer outcomes with emphasis on study design and methods of exposure assessment and dose estimation along with brief consideration of sources of bias for a few of the more important studies. We examine the findings from the epidemiological studies of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, persons exposed to radiation for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, those exposed to environmental sources including Chornobyl and other reactor accidents, and occupationally exposed cohorts. We also summarize results of pooled studies. These summaries are necessarily brief, but we provide references to more detailed information. We discuss possible future directions of study, to include assessment of susceptible populations, and possible new populations, data sources, study designs and methods of analysis. © 2024 by Radiation Research Society.

AB  - We developed a comprehensive database of medicines that are used or are being investigated for pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, preterm birth or labour, postpartum haemorrhage, intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal distress and that were in active development between 2000 and 2021. A total of 444 candidates were identified: approximately half of candidates were in active development, two-thirds had been repurposed after initially being used for another condition, and just under half were in preclinical studies. Only 64 candidates were in active late-stage (phase 3) development as of Oct 25, 2021, and given the slow pace of biomedical development, it could take years before any of these products eventually make it to market. A lack of innovation for maternal health medicines persists, and the market continues to fail pregnant individuals. There is a need for collective action from all relevant stakeholders to accelerate investment in the development of new or improved medicines for pregnancy-related conditions. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Climate change continues to increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat events and wildfires, both of which are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Few studies simultaneously evaluated exposures to these increasingly common exposures. Objectives: We investigated the relationship between exposure to heat and wildfire smoke and preterm birth (PTB). Methods: In this time-stratified case-crossover study, participants consisted of 85,806 California singleton PTBs (20–36 gestational weeks) from May through October of 2015–2019. Birthing parent ZIP codes were linked to high-resolution daily weather, PM<inf>2.5</inf> from wildfire smoke, and ambient air pollution data. Heat day was defined as a day with apparent temperature >98th percentile within each ZIP code and heat wave was defined as ≥2 consecutive heat days. Wildfire-smoke day was defined as a day with any exposure to wildfire-smoke PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing exposures during a hazard period (lags 0–6) compared to control periods. Analyses were adjusted for relative humidity, fine particles, and ozone. Results: Wildfire-smoke days were associated with 3.0% increased odds of PTB (OR<inf>lag0</inf>: 1.03, CI: 1.00–1.05). Compared with white participants, associations appeared stronger among Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indians/Alaskan Native participants. Heatwave days (OR<inf>lag2</inf>: 1.07, CI: 1.02–1.13) were positively associated with PTB, with stronger associations among those simultaneously exposed to wildfire smoke days (OR<inf>lag2</inf>: 1.19, CI: 1.11–1.27). Similar findings were observed for heat days and when other temperature metrics (e.g., maximum, minimum) were used. Discussion: Heat and wildfire increased PTB risk with evidence of synergism. As the occurrence and co-occurrence of these events increase, exposure reduction among pregnant people is critical, especially among racial/ethnic minorities. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Background: Evidence for the association between earthquakes and adverse perinatal outcomes is limited. Objectives: To evaluate the association between earthquakes and perinatal outcomes including preterm birth and low birth weight. Search Strategy: We searched studies using MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Platform Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov on February 9, 2023. Selection Criteria: We included before-and-after studies that evaluated the associations between earthquakes and perinatal outcomes in women living in affected areas. Data Collection and Analysis: Two independent reviewers extracted data. We calculated the pooled odds ratio (OR) with the random-effects model. We analyzed outcomes in subgroups of Asians and others. We evaluated the certainty of evidence with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. Main Results: We included 2 607 405 women in 13 studies. Earthquakes may not increase preterm birth (nine studies, 1 761 760 participants: OR 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98–1.24, low certainty of evidence) or low birth weight (seven studies, 1 753 891 participants: OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.94–1.28, low certainty of evidence). Subgroup analyses showed that earthquakes may be associated with an increase of preterm birth among populations in Asia (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.07–1.95), but this was not evident in others (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83–1.05). Conclusions: Perinatal outcomes might not change after earthquakes. Further research on the association between earthquakes and perinatal outcomes, combined with an assessment of the characteristics of the region, is needed. © 2024 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. The drivers of climate risk include its topography, ecological diversity, climatic variability, natural resource dependency, under-development, and socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Climate change affects women and girls in unique ways. Research conducted in Asia Pacific region highlight negative sexual and reproductive health outcomes from climate change-related stressors such as droughts, floods, and air pollution, factors also linked to decreased SRH services utilization, increased maternal mortality rates, and repercussions on women's mental health. METHODS: This is a mixed methods study conducted in two river basins including household surveys with 384 females ages 18-49, 12 focus group discussions, and 22 key informant interviews. We conducted descriptive and thematic analysis. RESULTS: More than half relied on agriculture for income (66%). Despite one-third being heads of households, land ownership was low (13%). Climate change perceptions included rising temperatures (88%), increased heat wave (70%), drying water source (99%), and delayed monsoons (83%), impacting agriculture and increasing women's workload (61%) due to displacement and male migration. 64% reported disturbances in antenatal and postnatal care visits . Inaccessible healthcare facilities during the rainy season increased maternal mortality risks. Heavy river flooding hindered female community health volunteers access leading to childbirth complications. 82% of women feared being unable to protect their children post-climate events. Moreover, 21% of women faced gender-based violence during or after climate disasters. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest clear impacts of climate change on women and the communities. Thus, climate adaptation efforts must be designed to address the unique impacts of the crisis on women and girls, making space for their increased participation and leadership.

AB  - Background: Hurricane Harvey made landfall in August 2017 and resulted in catastrophic flooding in Houston, Texas. Prior studies of hurricanes and preterm birth have found conflicting results. We tested the hypotheses that exposure to Hurricane Harvey was associated with a higher risk of spontaneous pre- and early-term birth and assessed vulnerable subpopulations. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of singleton births using administrative birth records in the nine-county greater Houston area from 2015 to 2019. We estimated the likelihood of pre- and early-term births using logistic regression, comparing births occurring during or within 1, 2, or 4 weeks of Hurricane Harvey to unexposed reference periods encompassing the same dates 2 years prior and after. Stratified models assessed effect modification by degree of flooding, birth parent age, high- vs. low-risk pregnancy, race/ethnicity, and prenatal care. Results: Among 15,564 births, we found no association between exposure to Hurricane Harvey and spontaneous preterm birth within 1 week adjusted (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91, 1.25) but a 14% higher odds of spontaneous early-term birth (OR, 1.14; 95% CI = 1.04, 1.25). The odds of early-term birth were even higher in neighborhoods with severe flooding (OR, 1.21; 95% CI = 1.05, 1.38), segregated neighborhoods (OR, 1.23; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.47), and among foreign-born Hispanics (OR, 1.21; 95% CI = 1.04, 1.53) and pregnant people receiving no prenatal care (OR, 1.37; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.82). Effect estimates were attenuated or null when considering 2-week or 4-week lags to define exposure. Conclusions: Hurricane Harvey was associated with higher odds of spontaneous early-term birth up to 1 week later, especially among socially marginalized populations. © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health.

AB  - Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services are crucial for women especially during disasters, to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity from miscarriages, unsafe abortions, and post-abortion complications. This study explored the SRH interventions provided during disaster response. A systematic review was conducted to identify what menstrual regulation (MR), safe abortion (SA), and post-abortion care (PAC) approaches/interventions exist to promote resilience in the health system in disaster settings; what intervention components were most effective; and challenges and opportunities to meeting SRH rights. Five electronic databases were searched, resulting in 4194 records. Following the screening process, seven publications were included. The intervention-related information in each publication was assessed based on availability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality. Two SRH approaches/interventions were found. The effectiveness of intervention components could not be conducted due to the limited number of relevant studies. Challenges were found at facility and community levels, and opportunities included overcoming them, making MR, SA, and PAC integral to the mitigation phase, and policy change to overcome barriers related to unaffordability and inaccessibility. Recommendations are provided to encourage research and policy towards improving neglected SRH in disaster settings to realize Sustainable Development Goal 3 and the Global Strategy and Sendai Framework’s priority to promote disaster-resilient health systems. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Objective: This article aims to analyse the evolution of 40 Sustainable Development Goals’ (SDGs) health-related indicators in Brazil and Ecuador from 1990 to 2019. Study design: Epidemiological study of long-term trends in 40 SDGs’ health-related indicators for Brazil and Ecuador from 1990 to 2019, using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study. Methods: Forty SDGs’ health-related indicators and an index from 1990 to 2017 for Brazil and Ecuador, and their projections up to 2030 were extracted from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Global Burden of Disease website and analysed. The percent annual change (PC) between 1990 and 2019 was calculated for both countries. Results: Both countries have made progress on child stunting (Brazil: PC = −38%; Ecuador: PC = −43%) and child wasting prevalences (Brazil: PC = −42%; Ecuador: PC = −41%), percent of vaccine coverage (Brazil: PC = +215%; Ecuador: PC = +175%), under-5 (Brazil: PC = −75%; Ecuador: PC = −60%) and neonatal mortality rates (Brazil: PC = −69%; Ecuador: PC = −51%), health worker density per 1000 population (Brazil: PC = +153%; Ecuador: PC = +175%), reduction of neglected diseases prevalences (Brazil: PC = −40%; Ecuador: PC = −58%), tuberculosis (Brazil: PC = −27%; Ecuador: PC = −55%) and malaria incidences (Brazil: PC = −97%; Ecuador: PC = −100%), water, sanitation and hygiene mortality rates (Brazil and Ecuador: PC = −89%). However, both countries did not show sufficient improvement in maternal mortality ratio to meet SDGs targets (Brazil: PC = −37%; Ecuador: PC = −40%). Worsening of indicators were found for violence, such as non-intimate partner violence for both countries (Brazil: PC = +26%; Ecuador: PC = +18%) and suicide mortality rate for Ecuador (PC = +66%), child overweight indicator for Brazil (PC = −67%), disaster mortality rates (Brazil: PC = +100%; Ecuador: PC = +325%) and alcohol consumption (Brazil: PC = +46%; Ecuador: PC = +35%). Conclusions: Significant improvements are necessary in both countries requiring the strengthening of health and other policies, particularly concerning the prevention and management of violence and alcohol consumption, and preparedness for dealing with environmental disasters. © 2024 The Royal Society for Public Health

AB  - Background: Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and post-abortion hemorrhage (PAH) are life-threatening conditions. Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of uterine arterial embolization (UAE) for PPH and PAH and to investigate future fertility after UAE. Material and Methods: This study included 57 consecutive patients (mean age = 34 years) who underwent UAE for PPH (n = 46) and PAH (n = 11) at our institution between January 2011 and December 2022. Technical success, non-visualization of the peripheral portion of bilateral uterine arteries on angiography, and clinical success, complete hemostasis after UAE, were assessed. UAE-associated complications and factors related to clinical success were analyzed. Pregnancy outcomes after UAE and complications during subsequent pregnancy were investigated in 16 patients who desired fertility and were followed up for >1 year. Results: The technical and clinical success rates were 100% and 84.2%, respectively. Sepsis (n = 1) and uterine empyema (n = 1) were observed as severe complications. Placental disorder, bleeding within 24 h after delivery or abortion, ≥1.5 shock index, ≥6 units of transfusion erythrocytes, and ≥8 obstetrical disseminated intravascular coagulation score were significantly associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. In total, 16 pregnancies were observed in 12 patients after UAE, three of which were miscarriages and 13 were successful live births. During pregnancy, uterine rupture (n = 1) and accreta (n = 1) were observed. Conclusion: UAE is an effective treatment for PPH and PAH. Although UAE could preserve future fertility, careful attention should be paid to perinatal management for unusual complications. © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2024.

AB  - Trauma is the leading cause of non-obstetric maternal mortality and contributes to around 20% cases of maternal deaths. The commonest cause of trauma during pregnancy is road traffic accidents. An 18-year-old G2 P1 L1 at 13 weeks of gestation living in a makeshift tent near a construction site came under a landslide. She remained buried under the rubbles until she could be excavated next day. Patient reached our facility almost 27 h after the incident. Primary survey revealed patent airway; however, she had tachypnea, tachycardia and hypotension, positive FAST examination, and fetus floating in fluid filled peritoneal cavity on USG abdomen. Patient was resuscitated and immediately taken for exploration, which revealed hemoperitoneum, uterine fundus perforation with decapitated fetus in the peritoneal cavity, two jejunal perforations, and tear in urinary bladder wall and anterior vaginal wall. Primary repair of jejunal and uterine perforations with suprapubic cystostomy (SPC) was followed by repair of the anterior vaginal wall at a later stage. Patient was discharged in healthy condition and is doing well on follow-up. Management of trauma in pregnancy is challenging due to physiological changes and involves concurrent resuscitation of two patients. The uterus remains an intra-pelvic organ until 12–14 weeks of gestation and is protected by the pelvic skeleton. The incidence of rupture of scarred uterus is between 0.3 and 1 % and that of unscarred uterus is 1 in 5700 to 1 in 20,000 pregnancies. Almost all of these ruptures occur in 3rd trimester near term. Traumatic uterine rupture is reported to have almost 100% fetal and 46% maternal mortality. Uterine trauma with fetal demise is more common in the late second and third trimester and placental abruption being leading cause of fetal death in such cases. Traumatic uterine rupture in first trimester is extremely rare. Traumatic uterine rupture with fetal decapitation in early pregnancy has not been reported to best of our knowledge. © Association of Surgeons of India 2023.

AB  - Objective While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had global impact in all populations, certain groups of patients have experienced disproportionate rates of morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between COVID-19 disease severity, demographic variables, race and ethnicity, and social determinants of health among pregnant patients in a diverse urban population. Study Design A retrospective analysis was performed of all pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at two urban tertiary care centers in Houston, TX between March and August 2020. Maternal demographic, COVID-19 illness criteria, and delivery characteristics were collected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) were obtained based on a patients' census tract of residence. Analyses compared persons with asymptomatic, mild, or severe-critical disease at diagnosis. Results A total of 317 persons tested positive for COVID-19 during this time period. Asymptomatic persons were more likely to be diagnosed at later gestational ages, but there were no other differences in baseline maternal characteristics. Persons with more severe disease had greater social vulnerability specifically for housing and transportation than those with mild disease (mean SVI [standard error]: 0.72 [0.06] vs. 0.58 [0.2], p = 0.03). Total SVI, total CCVI, and other themed SVI and CCVI indices were not significantly different between groups. Conclusion In this cohort of pregnant persons infected with SARS-CoV-2, an association was shown between disease severity and increased vulnerability in living conditions and transportation. Drivers of the pandemic and COVID-19 outcomes are complex and multifactorial, and likely change over time. However, continued efforts to accurately identify and measure social determinants of health in medicine will likely help identify geographic areas and patient populations that are at risk of higher disease burden. This could facilitate preventative and mitigation measures in these areas in future disaster or pandemic situations. © 2022. Thieme. All rights reserved.

TI  - Perinatal mortality after Chornobyl in contaminated regions of Ukraine

AB  - Background Belarus and Ukraine were the countries most affected by the consequences of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. A study of perinatal mortality in Belarus found a highly statistically significant increase in the 1990s in the most contaminated oblast Gomel but no increase during this period in the rest of Belarus. As a possible mechanism to interpret this increase as a late Chornobyl effect, it has been suggested that strontium-90 contained in Chornobyl fallout, incorporated during menarche, impairs the immune system of pregnant women which in turn increases perinatal mortality. In the present study, this hypothesis is tested using data from Ukraine. Methods Annual data on perinatal mortality, in the period 1981-2006 were provided by the Ministry of Public Health of Ukraine. Trends in perinatal mortality rates in the most contaminated regions of Ukraine (Kyiv and Zhytomyr oblasts and the city of Kyiv; study region) were compared with rates in the rest of Ukraine (control region). To identify any differences in perinatal mortality trends between the study and control regions, the ratios of perinatal mortality rates in the study region to the rates in the control region were analyzed using the calculated strontium concentration as a predictor. Results A trend analysis of perinatal mortality rates in Ukraine revealed two bell-shaped deviations from a long-term exponential trend with maxima at the beginning and end of the 1990s. The same pattern was found in the data from the study and control regions, but the deviations were almost three times higher in the study region than in the control region. An analysis of the ratios of perinatal mortality rates in the study region to the rates in the control region (odds ratios) showed an increase and decrease during the 1990s which was approximated by a lognormal density distribution. The calculated strontium concentration, when used as a predictor, also fitted the data well. Thus, the data from Ukraine confirms the results from Belarus. The analysis of the odds ratios revealed about 1000 excess perinatal deaths in the study region in the period 1990-2004. The corresponding figure for Ukraine as a whole was estimated at 3500 perinatal deaths. Conclusion It is hypothesized that the observed increase in perinatal mortality in the 1990s may be a late effect of incorporated strontium-90 on the immune system of pregnant women. The analysis is based on a theoretical model, as no data on strontium concentrations were available; the results should therefore be interpreted with caution. An updated study for Belarus would be desirable to corroborate the results. © 2024 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Wildfire air pollution is a growing concern on human health. The study aims to assess the associations between wildfire air pollution and pregnancy outcomes in the Southwestern United States. Study design: This was a retrospective cohort study. Methods: Birth records of 627,404 singleton deliveries in 2018 were obtained in eight states of the Southwestern United States and were linked to wildfire-sourced fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and their constituents (black carbon [BC] and organic carbon [OC]) during the entire gestational period. A double-robust logistic regression model was used to assess the associations of wildfire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposures and preterm birth and term low birth weight, adjusting for non-fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposure and individual- and area-level confounder variables. Results: Wildfire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> contributed on average 15% of the ambient total PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations. For preterm birth, the strongest association was observed in the second trimester (odds ratio [OR]: 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05–1.07 for PM<inf>2.5</inf>; 1.06, 95% CI: 1.05–1.07 for BC; 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03–1.05 for OC, per interquartile range increment of exposure), with higher risks identified among non-smokers or those with low socio-economic status. For term low birth weight, the associations with wildfire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposures were consistently elevated for all trimesters except for the exposure averaged over the entire gestational period. Overall, the associations between wildfire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> and pregnancy outcomes were stronger than those with total PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Conclusions: Wildfire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> and its constituents are linked to higher risks of preterm birth and term low birth weight among a significant US population than the effects of ambient total PM<inf>2.5</inf>. © 2024 The Royal Society for Public Health

AB  - BACKGROUND: National second-trimester scanning of cervical length was introduced in Israel in 2010, and in the decade thereafter, a significant systematic reduction in preterm birth and in the delivery of low birthweight babies was found among singletons. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a national policy mandating second-trimester cervical length screening by ultrasound, followed by vaginal progesterone treatment for short cervical length in comparison with no screening strategy. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a decision model comparing 2 strategies, namely (1) universal cervical length screening, and (2) no screening strategy. This study used the national delivery registry of Israel's Ministry of Health. All women diagnosed with a second-trimester cervical length <25 mm were treated with vaginal progesterone and were monitored with a bimonthly ultrasound scan for cervical dynamics and threat of early delivery. Preterm birth prevalence associated with short cervical length, the efficacy of progesterone in preterm birth prevention, and the accuracy of cervical length measurements were derived from previous studies. The cost of progesterone and bimonthly sonographic surveillance, low birthweight delivery, newborn admission to intensive care units, the first-year costs of managing preterm birth and low birthweight, and instances of handicaps and the cost of their follow-up were extracted from the publicly posted registry of Israel's Ministry of Health and Israel Social Securities data. Monte Carlo simulations decision tree mode, Tornado diagrams, and 1- and 2-way sensitivity analyses were implemented and the base case and sensitivity to parameters that were predicted to influence cost-effectiveness were calculated. RESULTS: Without cervical length screening, the discounted quality-adjusted life years were 30.179, and with universal cervical length screening, it increased to 30.198 (difference of 0.018 quality-adjusted life years). The average cost of no screening for cervical length strategy was $1047, and for universal cervical length screening, it was reduced to $998. The calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was −$2676 per quality-adjusted life year (dividing the difference in costs by the difference in quality-adjusted life years). Monte Carlo simulation of cervical length screening of 170,000 singleton newborns (rounded large number close to the number of singleton newborns in Israel) showed that 95.17% of all babies were delivered at gestational week ≥37 in comparison with 94.46% of babies with the no screening strategy. Given 170,000 singleton births, the national savings of screening for short cervical length when compared with no cervical length screening amounted to $8.31M annually, equating to $48.84 for a base case, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each case of low birthweight or very low birthweight avoided was −$14,718. A cervical length <25 mm was measured for 30,090 women, and of those, 24,650 were false positives. The major parameters that affected the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were the incidence of preterm birth, the specificity of cervical length measurements, and the efficacy of progesterone treatment. At a preterm birth incidence of <3%, universal screening does not lead to a cost saving. CONCLUSION: National universal cervical length screening should be incorporated into the routine anomaly scan in the second trimester, because it leads to a drop in the incidence of preterm birth and low birthweight babies in singleton pregnancies, thereby saving costs related to the newborn and gaining quality-adjusted life years. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Ninety-four percent of global maternal deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The UN has a goal of reducing maternal deaths to <70 per 100,000 live births by 2030, but progress is minimal. Maternal deaths in LMICs are associated with 3 delays in the care of women with obstetrical emergencies: 1) in the family of the woman realizing that her life is at risk, 2) in the transport of the woman to a hospital, and 3) in providing care after arrival at the hospital. These 3 delays function like links in a chain, and failure of any link leads to maternal death. LMICs have characteristics that make it likely that the chain will break. Women in LMICs frequently have low standing, and cultural beliefs often lead to delay in the recognition of obstetrical emergencies. LMICs are characterized by poor roads and long distances to hospitals leading to transport delays. Cultural and other factors also lead to treatment delays when a woman reaches a suitably-equipped and staffed hospital. Nepal has addressed these delays and reduced maternal mortality. Firstly, we have reported in the Journal the use of culturally acceptable approaches to improving the knowledge about antenatal care in remote villages. In the case of Nepal, singing songs related to maternal care proved to be a highly effective strategy. We now report that the government of Nepal has repurposed military helicopters to overcome the tyranny of poor roads to allow rapid transport of women with obstetrical emergencies to a small number of fully-equipped and staffed hospitals. As of June 2023, this service has successfully retrieved 625 women in four and half years. The Nepalese government has included questions on maternal mortality in the 2021 national census, followed by a verbal autopsy. These data indicate a fall in the maternal mortality ratio from 239 in 2016 to 151 in 2021. The efficiency of the triage service continues to improve, suggesting that maternal mortality will continue to fall. This may provide a model that can be implemented in other LMICs and highlights factors that may be responsible for recent increases in the US maternal mortality ratio. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Global climate change has transformed predictions of fire seasons in the near future, and record-breaking wildfire events have had catastrophic consequences in recent years. In September 2020, multiple wildfires subjected Oregon to hazardous air quality for several days. In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to examine prenatal loss, morbidity, and mortality of rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) exposed to poor air quality from the nearby wildfires. Detailed medical records from 2014 to 2020 of 580 macaques housed outdoors at a research facility in Beaverton, Oregon were used to evaluate the association between these health outcomes and wildfire smoke exposure. Logistic regression models estimated excess prenatal loss, hospitalization rates, respiratory problems, and mortality during and following the wildfire event, and Kruskal–Wallis statistics were used to determine if infant growth was affected by wildfire smoke exposure. Risk of pregnancy loss (relative risk = 4.1; p < 0.001) and odds of diagnosis with a respiratory problem (odds ratio = 4.47; p = 0.003) were higher in exposed infant macaques compared to nonexposed infants. Infant growth was not affected by poor air quality exposure. Our findings suggest wildfire smoke exposure poses a risk to the health of infants and pregnant individuals and should be monitored more closely in the future. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Objective: To study the impact of unhealthy air quality from the 2020 Oregon wildfires on outcomes for patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Design: A retrospective cohort study. Setting: A university-based fertility clinic. Patients: Subjects were undergoing IVF treatment from the 6 weeks preceding the wildfires through a 10-day exposure period. Cohorts were classified on the basis of whether subjects experienced patient and/or laboratory exposure to unhealthy air quality. Patient exposure was defined as at least 4 days of ovarian stimulation overlapping with the exposure, and laboratory exposure was defined as at least 2 days of IVF treatment and embryogenesis overlapping with the exposure. The unexposed cohort consisted of remaining subjects without defined exposure, with cycles in the 6 weeks preceding the wildfires. As some subjects had dual exposure and appeared in both patient and laboratory exposure cohorts, each cohort was separately compared with the unexposed control cohort. Intervention: A 10-day period of unhealthy air quality caused by smoke plumes from a wildfire event. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was the blastulation rate. Secondary outcomes included fertilization rate, number of blastocysts obtained, and cycles with no blastocysts frozen or transferred. Results: Sixty-nine subjects underwent ovarian stimulation and IVF treatment during the 6 weeks preceding the wildfires through the 10-day period of unhealthy air quality. Of these, 15 patients were in the laboratory exposure cohort, 16 were in the patient exposure cohort, and 44 were unexposed. Six subjects appeared in both laboratory and patient exposure cohorts. Although neither exposure cohort had significantly decreased blastulation rate compared with the unexposed, the median number of blastocysts obtained was significantly lower in the laboratory exposure cohort than the unexposed group (2 [range 0–14] vs. 4.5 [range 0–21], respectively). The laboratory exposure cohort had significantly more cycles with no blastocysts obtained (3/15 [20%] vs. 1/44 [2%]). There were no significant differences in IVF treatment outcomes between patient exposure and unexposed cohorts. These findings persisted after controlling for age. There were no significant differences in pregnancy outcomes observed after embryo transfer between the exposure group and the unexposed group. Conclusion: For a cohort of patients undergoing IVF treatment, an acute episode of outside wildfire smoke exposure during fertilization and embryogenesis was associated with decreased blastocyst yield. © 2023 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

AB  - Objective: In this discussion, we build the case for why climate change is an emerging threat to perinatal mental health. Method: A search of current literature on perinatal and maternal mental health and extreme weather events was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science databases. Only articles focusing on maternal mental health were included in this narrative review. Results: The perinatal period represents a potentially challenging timeframe for women for several reasons. Necessary role adjustments (reprioritization), changes in one’s ability to access pre-birth levels (and types) of social support, fluctuating hormones, changes in body shape, and possible complications during pregnancy, childbirth, or postpartum are just a few of the factors that can impact perinatal mental health. Trauma is also a risk factor for negative mood symptoms and can be experienced as the result of many different types of events, including exposure to extreme weather/natural disasters. Conclusion: While the concepts of “eco-anxiety,” “climate despair,” and “climate anxiety” have garnered attention in the mainstream media, there is little to no discussion of how the climate crisis impacts maternal mental health. This is an important omission as the mother’s mental health impacts the family unit as a whole. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: Wildfires in the Western United States are a growing and significant source of air pollution that is eroding decades of progress in air pollution reduction. The effects on preterm birth during critical periods of pregnancy are unknown. Methods: We assessed associations between prenatal exposure to wildland fire smoke and risk of preterm birth (gestational age < 37 weeks). We assigned smoke exposure to geocoded residence at birth for all live singleton births in California conceived 2007–2018, using weekly average concentrations of particulate matter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) attributable to wildland fires from United States Environmental Protection Agency's Community Multiscale Air Quality Model. Logistic regression yielded odds ratio (OR) for preterm birth in relation to increases in average exposure across the whole pregnancy, each trimester, and each week of pregnancy. Models adjusted for season, age, education, race/ethnicity, medical insurance, and smoking of the birthing parent. Results: For the 5,155,026 births, higher wildland fire PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposure averaged across pregnancy, or any trimester, was associated with higher odds of preterm birth. The OR for an increase of 1 µg/m3 of average wildland fire PM<inf>2.5</inf> during pregnancy was 1.013 (95 % CI:1.008,1.017). Wildland fire PM<inf>2.5</inf> during most weeks of pregnancy was associated with higher odds. Strongest estimates were observed in weeks in the second and third trimesters. A 10 µg/m3 increase in average wildland fire PM<inf>2·5</inf> in gestational week 23 was associated with OR = 1.034; 95 % CI: 1.019, 1.049 for preterm birth. Conclusions: Preterm birth is sensitive to wildland fire PM<inf>2.5</inf>; therefore, we must reduce exposure during pregnancy. © 2024

AB  - Background: Migration due to environmental factors is an international crisis affecting many nations globally. Pregnant people are a vulnerable subgroup of migrants. Aim: This article explores the potential effects of environmental migration on pregnancy and aims to draw attention to this rising concern. Methods: Based on the study aim, a semi-structured literature review was performed. The following databases were searched: MEDLine (PubMed) and Google Scholar. The search was originally conducted on 31st January 2021 and repeated on 22nd September 2022. Results: Pregnant migrants are at increased risk of mental health disorders, congenital anomalies, preterm birth, and maternal mortality. Pregnancies exposed to natural disasters are at risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, and mental health morbidity. Along with the health risks, there are additional complex social factors affecting healthcare engagement in this population. Conclusion: Maternity healthcare providers are likely to provide care for environmental migrants over the coming years. Environmental disasters and migration as individual factors have complex effects on perinatal health, and environmental migrants may be at risk of specific perinatal complications. Obstetricians and maternity healthcare workers should be aware of these challenges and appreciate the individualised and specialised care that these patients require. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Background Bangladesh's islands, because of their geographical location, frequently encounter crises like floods and river erosion, which pose significant threats to the residents' well-being and livelihoods. To delve into the effects of these disasters on livelihood and healthcare challenges, a mixed-method study was undertaken in a riverine-island near a major river of Bangladesh. Methodology Between February 15th and February 28th, 2023, a cross-sectional study was conducted on an island in Bangladesh. The quantitative method involved conducting a survey of 442 households, with a total of 2921 participants. Additionally, 10 in-depth interviews and 10 key-informant interviews were conducted using semi-structured guidelines. Qualitative interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a thematic analysis. Triangulation was employed in this study through the integration of qualitative and quantitative analysis, resulting in the presentation of findings that offer an in-depth comprehension of the phenomenon being investigated. Results River erosions and floods are common and recurring natural disasters that significantly impact the lives of the riverine island inhabitants. These disasters often disrupted their livelihoods, forced many residents to endure substandard living conditions or relocated during flood events. The island faced a low diagnostic prevalence of chronic diseases (e.g., 5.1% of adults were hypertension and 2.5% are diabetes) because of the absence of diagnostic facilities and a shortage of certified doctors. A significant number of chronic illness people in the community turned to alternative medicine sources (39.3%) such as homeopathy, Kabiraj, and Ayurvedic medicine, especially it gets increased during periods of natural disasters. Moreover, reproductive aged women revealed that 79.4% of them gave birth at home, with 6.0% of these home deliveries resulting in miscarriage or infant death. The destruction of crops, unstable job opportunities, an inadequate educational system, and a deficient healthcare delivery system exacerbated the hardships faced by the population affected by these disasters. Conclusion The failure to seek treatment for chronic diseases and undiagnosed diseases is a significant health issue among the aging adults on the island. Island residents face the challenge of establishing effective prevention strategies for the well-being of older adults especially at the period of natural disasters. It is crucial for the government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to collaborate to prevent the negative effects of floods and river erosions. This should include efforts to enhance the quality of education, healthcare services, job opportunities, and financial assistance for rebuilding homes. © 2024 Hossain et al.

AB  - Climate change is the most pressing challenge of the 21st century. It’s immediate impacts on the environment are extreme weather conditions such as heatwaves, storms, rains, floods, sealevel rise, the disruption of crops, agricultural systems, water, vector-borne diseases, and ecosystems. The weather-related disasters disturbed the natural biological environment and dislocated millions of people from their homes. The extreme weather conditions caused the deaths of about two million people and $4.3 trillion in economic loss over the past half a century, and 90% of deaths were reported from developing countries. It has also been predicted that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is presumed to cause about 250,000 additional deaths per annum. The rapid rise in temperatures, frequencies of heat waves, wildfires, storms, and other weather extremes conditions could affect human health in many ways. The one-degree Celsius rise in outdoor temperature causes over 100,000 new cases of diabetes mellitus per annum. Climate change compromised body metabolism, vasodilation, sweating, insulin resistance and cause Type-2 diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes Mellitus. © 2024, Professional Medical Publications.

AB  - Purpose of Review: Wildfire smoke is associated with human health, becoming an increasing public health concern. However, a comprehensive synthesis of the current evidence on the health impacts of ambient wildfire smoke on children and adolescents, an exceptionally vulnerable population, is lacking. We conduct a systematic review of peer-reviewed epidemiological studies on the association between wildfire smoke and health of children and adolescents. Recent Findings: We searched for studies available in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus from database inception up to October 11, 2022. Of 4926 studies initially identified, 59 studies from 14 countries were ultimately eligible. Over 33.3% of the studies were conducted in the USA, and two focused on multi-countries. The exposure assessment of wildfire smoke was heterogenous, with wildfire-specific particulate matters with diameters ≤ 2.5 µm (PM<inf>2.5</inf>, 22.0%) and all-source (22.0%) PM<inf>2.5</inf> during wildfire period most frequently used. Over half of studies (50.6%) focused on respiratory-related morbidities/mortalities. Wildfire smoke exposure was consistently associated with enhanced risks of adverse health outcomes in children/adolescents. Meta-analysis results presented a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.12) for all-cause respiratory morbidity, 1.11 (95% Ci: 0.93-1.32) for asthma, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85–1.03) for bronchitis, and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.05–1.23) for upper respiratory infection, whilst − 21.71 g for birth weight (95% CI, − 32.92 to − 10.50) per 10 µg/m3 increment in wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>/all-source PM<inf>2.5</inf> during wildfire event. Summary: The majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with multiple adverse health outcomes among children and adolescents, with respiratory morbidities of significant concern. In-utero exposure to wildfire smoke may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes and have long-term impacts on height. Higher maternal baseline exposure to wildfire smoke and poor family-level baseline birthweight respectively elevated risks in preterm birth and low birth weight associated with wildfire smoke. More studies in low- and middle-income countries and focusing on extremely young children are needed. Despite technological progress, wildfire smoke exposure measurements remain uncertain, demanding improved methodologies to have more precise assessment of wildfire smoke levels and thus quantify the corresponding health impacts and guide public mitigation actions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Background: The current pandemic and future public health emergencies highlight the importance of evaluating a telehealth care model. Previous studies have reached mixed conclusions about the effectiveness of remote monitoring on glycemic control and maternal and infant outcomes in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Objectives: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of remote blood glucose monitoring for women with gestational diabetes mellitus and to provide evidence-based guidance on the management of women with gestational diabetes mellitus for policymakers and healthcare providers during situations such as pandemics or natural disasters. Methods: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, Embase, Medline, CINAHL databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched from their inception to July 10, 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English with respect to remote blood glucose monitoring in women with GDM were included in the meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers performed data extraction and assessed the quality of the studies. Risk ratios, mean differences, 95% confidence intervals, and heterogeneity were calculated. Results: A total of 1265 participants were included in the 11 RCTs. There were no significant differences in glycemic control and maternal–fetal outcomes between the remote monitoring group and a standard care group, which included glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, mean 2-h postprandial blood glucose, caesarean birth, gestational weight gain, shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and other outcomes. Conclusion: This meta-analysis reveals that it is unclear if remote glucose monitoring is preferable to standard of care glucose monitoring. To improve glycemic control and maternal–fetal outcomes during the current epidemic or other natural disasters, the implementation of double-blind RCTs in the context of simulating similar disasters remains to be studied in the future. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - In 2019/2020, multiple bushfires burned across south-east Australia converging into unprecedented megafires that burned 5.8 million hectares. From October 2019–February 2020, 80% of Australians were affected by smoke from these fires, exposing them to dramatic increases of PM<inf>2.5</inf>in the air at an average level of ∼70μg m3 per day, well above the World Health Organisation recommendation of ∼10μg m3. Maternal exposure to PM<inf>2.5</inf>has been associated with negative birth outcomes and an increased rate of birth defects, yet there is a dearth of literature regarding how pregnant women deal with exposure to bushfire smoke. The aim of this study was thus to investigate how pregnant and postpartum women experienced severe bushfire smoke associated with the 2019–2020 bushfires in south-east Australia and the strategies they used to mitigate exposure to smoke for themselves and their unborn or newborn children. Forty-three women who were exposed to fire and/or smoke from the 2019–2020 bushfires participated in one-on-one semi-structured interviews via phone or videoconference. These women were selected purposively from a larger group of women who had elected to be interviewed. After interview, data were transcribed and thematically analysed using the four phases of disaster response (prevention, preparedness, response, recovery) as a frame. Overall, our results indicated that public health advice failed to meet the unique needs of this group. While many protected their properties appropriately and were reasonably well prepared for evacuation, they were unprepared for the disruption to vital services including power and communications. Women exposed to smoke inundation were unprepared for this outcome and self-initiated a variety of strategies. The support of community was also key to recovery. There is a clear need for specific recognition of the needs of pregnant women across all phases of disaster response, incorporating public health messaging, peer support, and access to resources. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Frequent natural disasters like floods pose a major threat to India, with significant implications for public health. Low birth weight (LBW) is a critical global health concern, contributing to neonatal mortality. However, the association between floods and LBW remains underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the association between flood hazards and LBW in India using a geospatial approach. By analyzing data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) and flood zonation maps, the study aims to uncover the spatial dynamics of this association, offering insights into the implications of floods on birth weight across diverse geographical regions. Methods: The study used the fifth round of NFHS data, 2019–21, which involved 202,194 children selected through a multi-stage stratified sampling technique. The Vulnerability Atlas of India 2019 maps were also utilized to classify areas as flood or non-flood zones. Birth weight data from the NFHS-5 were categorized into three groups: very low, low, and normal birth weight (VLBW, LBW and NBW). Control variables including flood exposure, socio-demographic attributes, and geographic region were considered. Bivariate analysis and multinomial logistic regression were employed for statistical analysis. The spatial analysis involved Moran's I statistics and Geographically Weighted Regression to explore spatial dynamics of the association between floods and birth weight in India. Results: Floods predominantly affect India's lower Himalayan belts and western coastal regions. Flood-affected areas show higher proportions of VLBW and LBW infants. Groundwater usage and unimproved sanitation are associated with higher risk of VLBW and LBW. Sex, wealth, maternal education, residence type, and geographic region significantly influence birth weights. Multinomial logistic regression reveals 8 % and 27 % higher risks for LBW and VLBW in flood-affected regions. LISA cluster maps identify high-risk areas for both LBW and floods. Geographically Weighted Regression highlights 52 % of the variability in LBW occurrences can be attributed to the influence of flood hazards. Families hailing from the poorest wealth background and exposed to flood hazards bear a 5 % heightened likelihood of delivering LBW infants, in stark contrast to their counterparts from the same economic background yet unaffected by floods. Conclusions: The significant association between floods and LBW underscores the importance of robust disaster preparedness and public health strategies. By unraveling the spatial intricacies of flood-induced LBW disparities, this research provides valuable insights for promoting healthier birth outcomes and reducing child mortality rates, particularly in flood-prone regions. These findings emphasize the importance of holistic policies that address both environmental challenges and socioeconomic inequalities to safeguard maternal and infant health across the nation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wildfire smoke contains many different types of air pollutants which are cause for concern. Studies on epidemiology have identified correlations between PM2.5 exposure to wildfire smoke and mortality, respiratory and cardiovascular morbidities, and may result in a reduction in birth weight. However, evidence from Indonesia is limited. For this study, a retrospective cohort epidemiological study was undertaken to quantify the Indonesian population's exposure to wildfire-PM2.5. We present 9652 (88%) records of newborns to identify an association between fire-sourced PM2.5 and birth weight in Palangka Raya, Indonesia from 2015 to 2019. On an annual basis, geospatial, and season variations in wildfire-PM2.5 concentrations were observed using a satellite-based dataset from CAMS and used for gestational exposure to wildfire smoke. Applying a general linear model with birth weight (yi) as a continuous outcome, the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and low birth weight was examined. In addition, the binary outcome of low birth weight was analysed. A statistically significant difference in the birth weight reduction between infants delivered to mothers exposed to high levels of wildfire smoke and those exposed to low levels of wildfire smoke was observed over the entire time frame (2015-2019) (ρ-value < 0.001). In comparison to infants born to mothers exposed to lower concentrations, the birth weight of infants delivered to mothers exposed to high concentrations of PM2.5 in the third trimester decreased by 19.96%. A 1.9% reduction in birth weight could be caused by exposure during the fire-prevalent in the first trimester of pregnancy (ρ-value < 0.001). Since an estimation model predicted a 10 g/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure between the first and last trimesters of pregnancy, variations in the second trimester did not significantly affect the association (ρ-value = 0.761). This emphasizes the significance of foetal development during these two trimesters. Exposure to pollution from wildfires contributes significantly to the global burden of newborns' birth weight. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - We review current knowledge on the trends and drivers of global wildfire activity, advances in the measurement of wildfire smoke exposure, and evidence on the health effects of this exposure. We describe methodological issues in estimating the causal effects of wildfire smoke exposures on health and quantify their importance, emphasizing the role of nonlinear and lagged effects. We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the health effects of wildfire smoke exposure, finding positive impacts on all-cause mortality and respiratory hospitalizations but less consistent evidence on cardiovascular morbidity. We conclude by highlighting priority areas for future research, including leveraging recently developed spatially and temporally resolved wildfire-specific ambient air pollution data to improve estimates of the health effects of wildfire smoke exposure. © © 2024 by the author(s).

AB  - Background: Maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy is associated with adverse birth outcomes, although less is known for wildfire smoke. This systematic review evaluated the association between maternal exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy and the risk of perinatal, obstetric, and early childhood health outcomes. Methods: We searched CINAHL Complete, Ovid/EMBASE, Ovid/MEDLINE, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant epidemiological observational studies indexed through September 2023. The screening of titles, abstracts, and full-texts, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment was performed by pairs of independent reviewers. Results: Our systematic search yielded 28,549 records. After duplicate removal, we screened 14,009 studies, identifying 31 for inclusion in the present review. Data extraction highlighted high methodological heterogeneity between studies, including a lack of geographic variation. Approximately 56.5% and 16% originated in the United States and Brazil, respectively, and fewer in other countries. Among the studies, wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy was assessed using distance of residence from wildfire-affected areas (n = 15), measurement of air pollutant concentration during wildfires (n = 11), number of wildfire records (n = 3), aerosol index (n = 1), and geographic hot spots (n = 1). Pooled meta-analysis for birthweight and low birthweight were inconclusive, likely due to low number of methodologically homogenous studies. However, the reviewed studies provided suggestive evidence for an increased risk of birthweight reduction, low birthweight, preterm birth, and other adverse health outcomes. Conclusions: This review identified 31 studies evaluating the impacts of maternal wildfire smoke exposure on maternal, infant, and child health. Although we found suggestive evidence of harm from exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy, more methodologically homogenous studies are required to enable future meta-analysis with greater statistical power to more accurately evaluate the association between maternal wildfire smoke and adverse birth outcomes and other health outcomes. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The impact of the environment on human health in modern conditions cannot be underestimated. The study of the pathogenesis of disease is impossible without establishing the factors of destabilization of biological membranes. The article highlighted the problem of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defense associated with the accumulation of radiocesium in the placenta. Objective: to determine the biochemical markers of miscarriage associated with the accumulation of137Cs in the pla-centa. Materials and methods. According to the research design, pregnant women were divided into groups. Group 1 included 153 women with reproductive losses in anamnesis and signs of termination of the current pregnancy. Group 2 (control) included 30 women with an uncomplicated pregnancy and medical history. The women of Group 1 were divided into subgroups: 1a – in which the pregnancy ended with timely delivery, despite threatening signs of termination; 1b – pregnancy ended in late premature birth; 1c – pregnancy ended in early premature birth. Accumulation of137Cs with different activity was detected in the placentas of both groups by β-spectrometry. The effect of137Cs is the activation of free radical processes. The strength of oxidative stress was studied by the content of diene conjugates (DC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the blood. The antioxidant capacity was determined by the activity of catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Biochemical studies were per-formed using a spectrophotometer «Specol-11» (Germany). Results. The increase of DC in the 1st trimester by 2.25 times, in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters by 1.25 and 1.5 times indicates the activation of free radical reactions. The trigger for late preterm births is an increase in MDA in the 1st trimester by 17.4 %. An increase in MDA by 23.4 % in the 1st trimester indicates the risk of early premature birth and intrauterine death of the fetus. A decrease in the activity of SOD in the 1st trimester by 13.0 % can be a predictor of premature birth. Decreased activity of SOD by 18.2 % in the 1st trimester indicates decompensation of adaptation mechanisms. As a result of oxidative stress caused by the accumulation of137Cs in the placenta, the activity of GST decreases almost 2 times. In the 1st trimester, catalase activity in the blood of pregnant women of the 1b and 1c subgroups was reduced by 39.2 % and 44.9 %. The dynamics of catalase in the 2nd trimester indicate the activation of adaptive reactions. After 25 weeks, catalase activity is inhibited in pregnant women of subgroups 1b and 1c due to depletion of antioxidant protection mechanisms. The activity of137Cs in the placenta above 4.5 Bq/kg causes depletion of antioxidant mechanisms, which is confirmed by persistent inhibition of catalase and SOD activity against the background of high levels of DC and MDA in the blood. Critical for pregnancy is the activity of137Cs in the placenta above 10.4 Bq/kg. Conclusions. The accumulation of137Cs in the placenta leads to the activation of lipid peroxidation beyond the capacity of the antioxidant system. Extreme effects depend on the137Cs activity and placenta compensatory ability. Indicators of MDA, DC, SOD, and catalase are prognostic regarding the power of oxidative stress and pregnancy scenarios.

AB  - A worldwide occurrence, climate change has profound effects on many facets of human existence, including health. The frequently disregarded relationship between climate change and female reproductive health is the major topic of this review. The reproductive health of women has particular challenges due to climate change, which is also linked to extreme weather events and environmental degradation. Maternal and child health outcomes are jeopardized, access to reproductive healthcare services is restricted, and healthcare infrastructure is disrupted as a result of rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and an increase in the frequency of natural disasters. Furthermore, alterations in environmental factors have the potential to worsen the existing disparities in reproductive health, with a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. A comprehensive strategy that incorporates gender-sensitive legislation, community resilience-building, and climate change mitigation techniques is needed to address the psychosocial effects of climate change on women. Understanding the intersectionality of vulnerabilities and addressing the particular difficulties experienced by women in various situations are crucial. A comprehensive strategy that takes into account sustainable farming methods, healthcare access, economic empowerment, and nutritional education is needed to address the complex interactions between food security and female fertility behavior. Communities' general growth and well-being can benefit from policies and initiatives that work to enhance both food security and reproductive health. One should keep in mind that this field is complex and constantly changing, and our understanding of these relationships is always expanding. The current review delves into the various ways that climate change affects the health of women through direct and indirect pathways. These include changes in fertility rates, elevated risks of unfavourable pregnancy outcomes, and increased rates of maternal illness and mortality. © 2024 Federal Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology.

AB  - Introduction: Due to their unique circumstances, pregnant women face a heightened risk of experiencing pregnancy complications during and after catastrophic events. This study aims to investigate the consequences of both natural and man-made disasters on pregnancy outcomes. Methods: This study is a systematic review. Searches were performed until May 31, 2024, in the electronic databases including Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus. Outcomes such as preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA), stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and pregnancy-related blood pressure complications were studied. Results: The search conducted in the databases yielded 3307 non-duplicate records. After reading the abstracts, 3204 articles were excluded based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full texts of 103 article were obtained. However, upon reading the full texts of articles, 13 of them did not meet the inclusion criteria for the study. Consequently, 90 articles were ultimately included. Conclusions: Natural and man-made disasters exert significant influence on adverse pregnancy outcomes. While it is impossible to prevent the incidence of natural disasters and often man-made disasters occur abruptly, the negative consequences of disas-ters, particularly natural ones, can be mitigated by enhancing prenatal care and avoiding detrimental elements such as smoking and alcohol. © 2024, This open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial 3.0 License (CC BY-NC 3.0).

AB  - Growing trend of air pollution has become one of the familiar environmental hazards for the society. It is a mixture of toxic compounds emerging from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Depending on the source and rate of emission the components of air pollution change dramatically. The primary human-made sources of air pollution may include vehicle emissions, natural gas to heat homes, fuel oils, and by-products of manufacturing and power generation and fumes from chemical production. In addition to that, various hazardous substances such as methane and other gases are released by decomposing organic matter in soils, and other gases include ash and smoke from volcanic eruptions, which are frequently caused by humans. Various reports around the world have consistently demonstrated that air pollution is a significant adaptable risk factor for enhanced mortality. Air pollutants can harm the health of humans, animals, plants, and buildings. The pollutants are in the form of gases, solid particles, or liquid droplets. Ozone (O3), nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2) are some of the gaseous pollutants that contribute to air pollution. The pollution is now the leading environmental cause of premature death. Cardiovascular events such as acute ischemic account for the majority of the additional mortality caused by air pollution. Aside from increased mortality, air contamination is linked to significant reductions in worker productivity. Exposure to air pollution has a wide range of negative consequences on peoples health. The effects of air pollution can be divided into short-term and long-term effects. The discomfort, such as irritation to the nose, eyes, throat or skin, as well as infections like bronchitis are short-term symptoms that are transient. It can also cause headaches, nausea and dizziness. The long-term effects of pollution can last for years and cause various respiratory diseases. Long-term damage to peoples nerves, brains, kidneys, liver, and other organs, birth defects are the consequences of air pollution (Brook et al. 2004; Newby et al. 2015; Zivin and Neidell 2018; Hamanaka and Mutlu 2018). © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - Nowadays IT and Information Systems underpin all human activity – health, travel, commerce, education, even entertainment and play. The quality of systems (reliability, availability, and accuracy) is paramount. Yet failures of systems are frequent and many times catastrophic. Information Systems failures have been studied for many years. Despite the development of numerous models, tools, and methodologies failures persist. Failures of systems are reported as scandals and/or disasters when their effects are catastrophic not only in the technical sense but also in their socioeconomic impact, but importantly because of the loss of life, the impact on the environment, political fallout and so on. Failures are caused by multifarious reasons, and their effects are also multidimensional. For example, the Volkswagen emissions scandal had many far-reaching effects. The faulty/malfunctioning IT system called Horizon (an electronic point of sale and accounting system) which was developed for the UK Post Office by Fujitsu, a Japanese multinational information and communications technology equipment and services corporation has in the last 20 years been Horizon’s failures and what followed over two decades constitute a scandal of monumental proportions which lead to a widespread miscarriage of justice. Over 900 innocent sub-postmasters (SPMs), men and women, were wrongly accused, prosecuted for theft, fraud, and false accounting. All of them suffered financial loss, most suffered bankruptcy, career ruin, and social humiliation. Despite their innocence, they were convicted, and several were imprisoned. To this day no prosecutions against the company that developed the software system, the auditors, the Post-Office, or the government, have taken place. In this paper we identify the nature of the problems following the installation of the Horizon system. By referring to professional codes of conduct and practice from other professions (such as Medicine and Law) and through using a STEEPLED analysis of the major events, and consequences for those involved, we propose guidelines for addressing the outstanding issues relating to those wronged by the failure of the Horizon IT system and the way it was handled by the Fujitsu, the Post Office, and the government. This study aims to raise awareness of all involved in order to at least minimize and at best avoiding future IT systems failures and resulting consequences and injustices. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Sierra Leone is a West African nation that has experienced several traumas which have gravely impacted the health and mental health of the population, including natural disasters (a flood and mudslide), accidents (a tanker explosion), and epidemics (HIV/AIDS, Ebola and COVID-19), in the context of ongoing recovery from a protracted decades-long brutal civil war despite ending two decades ago. This chapter presents an overview of health in Sierra Leone including a brief historical review, the evolution of technological solutions to accessing healthcare throughout the country including remote communities, and recent health-related initiatives where technology has been, and can be, useful. Under the leadership of the current president, H.E. Dr. Julius Maada Bio, a focus on health as one of the pillars of the Human Capital Development Agenda, has resulted in advancing health systems including through the use of technology in the context of mobilizing partnerships involving the public and private sectors and the diaspora to support health-related initiatives. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the association between wildfire exposure in pregnancy and spina bifida risk. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Linked Birth File with hospital discharge data between 2007 and 2010. The Birth File data were merged with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection data of the same year. Spina bifida was identified by its corresponding ICD-9 code listed on the hospital discharge of the newborn. Wildfire exposure was determined based on the zip code of the woman’s home address. Pregnancy was considered exposed to wildfire if the mother lived within 15 miles of a wildfire during the pregnancy or within 30 days prior to pregnancy. Results: There were 2,093,185 births and 659 cases of spina bifida between 2007 and 2010. The births were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression models and adjusted for potential confounders. Exposure to wildfire in the first trimester was associated with higher odds of spina bifida (aOR= 1.43 [1.11–1.84], p-value = 0.01). Wildfire exposure 30 days before the last menstrual period and during the second and third trimesters were not associated with higher spina bifida risk. Conclusion: Wildfire exposure has shown an increased risk of spina bifida during the early stages of pregnancy. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Mass casualties can result from natural events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and flooding, from disease, or intentional acts of terrorism. Populations considered vulnerable at baseline experience enhanced vulnerability during a mass casualty. Possible associations have been noted between exposure to a mass casualty event and increased risk of premature birth, fetal growth restriction, small-for-gestational-age neonates, and shortened duration of pregnancy. Care of pregnant people differs in that the presence of support persons, such as a spouse, family member, or birth support professional at birth is generally desired and has become a standard practice in the US. Birth outcomes are mixed and likely depend on the circumstances that initiated the mass casualty. In natural disasters, there is conflicting information about birth outcomes. Disaster management planning would benefit from the thoughtful and early involvement of obstetrician-gynecologists. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The climate crisis is one of the main existential threats to pregnant health. Today, more than 3,000 substances that are not part of the composition are considered air pollutants. These pollutants may contain chemicals, such as lead (Pb), nitrogen oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), volatile organic compounds (VOC), pesticides, microplastics (MP), nanoplastics (NPs), radionuclides, or biological materials (viruses and fungi), and are unlikely to cause long- or short-term negative effects such as low birth weight (LBW), preeclampsia, cardiovascular, and lung diseases during pregnancy. The effects of natural disasters such as radionuclides, desert sand, and dust storms are a multiplier of health threats that negatively affect pregnant and neonatal health. For example, the available evidence on the impact of dust episodes on pregnancy is very scarce despite their adverse effects on pregnancy, such as coccidioidomycosis. Despite interest in air pollutants, few studies have considered the effect of MPs and NPs during pregnancy, considering their various routes of polluting the air. Therefore, the absence of the effects of the aforementioned pollutants on pregnancy has encouraged us to conduct this research work. As a result, this chapter aims to discuss the main health challenges facing pregnant and newborn children, focusing on the most important routes of pollution for fetuses. This can lead to slow birth weight, reduced birth size, stillbirth, and delayed fetal growth. Furthermore, extreme weather conditions and their health effects on pregnancy will be briefly explained. © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights are reserved.

AB  - Background Climate change represents a fundamental threat to human health, with pregnant women and newborns being more susceptible than other populations. In this review, we aimed to describe the current landscape of available epidemiological evidence on key climate risks on maternal and newborn health (MNH). Methods We sought to identify published systematic and scoping reviews investigating the impact of different climate hazards and air pollution on MNH outcomes. With this in mind, we developed a systematic search strategy based on the concepts of ‘climate/air pollution hazards, ‘maternal health,’ and ‘newborn health,’ with restrictions to reviews published between 1 January 2010 and 6 February 2023, but without geographical or language restriction. Following full text screening and data extraction, we synthesised the results using narrative synthesis. Results We found 79 reviews investigating the effects of climate hazards on MNH, mainly focussing on outdoor air pollution (n = 47, 59%), heat (n = 24, 30%), and flood/ storm disasters (n = 7, 9%). Most were published after 2015 (n = 60, 76%). These reviews had consistent findings regarding the positive association of exposure to heat and to air pollution with adverse birth outcomes, particularly preterm birth. We found limited evidence for impacts of climate-related food and water security on MNH and did not identify any reviews on climate-sensitive infectious diseases and MNH. Conclusions Climate change could undermine recent improvements in maternal and newborn health. Our review provides an overview of key climate risks to MNH. It could therefore be useful to the MNH community to better understand the MNH needs for each climate hazard and to strengthen discussions on evidence and research gaps and potential actions. Despite the lack of comprehensive evidence for some climate hazards and for many maternal, perinatal, and newborn outcomes, we observed repeated findings of the impact of heat and air pollutants on birth outcomes, particularly preterm birth. It is time for policy dialogue to follow to specifically design climate policy and actions to protect the needs of MNH. © 2024 The Author(s). All rights reserved.

AB  - Diabetes is a noxious disease which might result in a global health care disaster. More than 46.3 crore people around the globe have diabetes, according to the IDF (International Diabetes Federation), which is expected to rise to 64.3 crore till 2030 and 78.3 crore by 2045. Diabetes Mellitus is an illness that occurs due to increased blood glucose levels. Regular urination, an increased desire for water, and an increase in appetite are symptoms of this. Types 1 and 2 are the most prevalent forms of this disease, and there is also a variety that develops during pregnancy and is referred to as gestational diabetes mellitus. Large datasets are analyzed by machine learning algorithms, which utilize statistical models to find trends. Our primary goal is to assess and contrast the various machine learning techniques currently in use in order to determine which approach is the most effective at producing high prediction accuracy for the huge dataset. The diagnosis of diabetes in an individual is made possible by algorithms like Random Forest, DT, NB, SVM, and XGBoost. In order to identify the optimal methodology, efficiency matrices and accuracy comparisons are computed for each. With this approach, XGBoost gives the 96% and Randon forest gives 94% approximate accuracy that making it much superior to other algorithms. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Women in coastal areas are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts due to existing gender inequality and socio-cultural norms in Bangladesh. This research aims to explore the vulnerability of women to climate change-induced natural hazards, the challenges they face due to the chain impacts of climate change, and the resulting violation of women's rights. Quantitative and qualitative data were used in this study, where 260 structured questionnaire surveys and 15 Focus Group Discussions were performed at Mongla and Shyamnagar Upazilas in Bagerhat and Satkhira districts, respectively. The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 software, and qualitative data was analyzed thematically. The results disclose that most respondents in Mongla and Shyamnagar reported an increase in the occurrence rate of climate change-induced natural hazards, with cyclones, salinity, and riverbank erosion being the most devastating in Mongla and cyclones, salinity, and storm surges in Shyamnagar. It affects the lives and livelihoods of people, with women being particularly vulnerable due to limited access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, and women's rights are violated in these areas. Half of the study area's population has been suffering from infections or inflammation in reproductive organs, especially among fisherwomen. The findings of this study recommend that provisions for alternative livelihoods should be made for women, and all women must be brought under the umbrella of fair social safety net programs. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Using National Vital Statistics Birth and Fetal Death Data from 1995 to 2020 linked to county-level information on wildfires, we use variation in wildfire timing to examine how effects of wildfire exposure on infant health vary by maternal education. Results indicate that wildfire exposure increases the likelihood of low birth weight and fetal death, but effects vary by both trimester and maternal education. Mediation analyses suggest the variation by maternal education reflects selective survival and unequal sensitivity, rather than differential parental response to wildfires. In addition, mediation analyses suggest that maternal behaviors explain a greater share of the relationship between wildfire exposure and infant health than air quality. Wildfires may therefore reduce infant health through stress. ©2024 Russell Sage Foundation.

AB  - Paramedics are highly trained emergency medical personnel who respond to people in crisis. Due to the nature of their work, they are exposed to potentially traumatic events on a routine basis. Such events are wide ranging in their nature including, multiple fatality motor vehicle accidents, physical assaults, suicide, sudden infant death syndrome, cardiac arrest, and natural disasters. Being a paramedic is a self-selected occupation and there is generally a personal belief that they can cope and effectively deal with the cases they attend; however, this self-belief does not make them immune to the impact of trauma. In this chapter we discuss the potential for work-related trauma, the challenges paramedics face to maintain mental health, and the ways in which they cope with these challenges to provide strategies to enhance positive personal change and posttraumatic growth (PTG). Utilizing the following vignette, the chapter discusses research that has been conducted with paramedics and links research to the case. A significant body of research has examined negative post-trauma trajectories in this population, but research also attests to PTG as a more common outcome of work-related trauma for paramedics than negative outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The chapter will also address the necessity for proactive organizational commitment to the task of promoting mental health in the workforce. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Jane Shakespeare-Finch, Paul J.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of exposure to weather events during gestation on birth weight and anthropometric health of a cohort of children. We explore birth records for the cohort of children born between 2003 and 2013 in Sierra Leone using Demographic Health Surveys linked to temporal variation of rainfall and temperature patterns. We find that in utero droughts (or abnormally low precipitation levels) increase the prevalence of low birth weight with larger effects among boys. However, the effects of those same in utero shocks on the prevalence of stunting up to 59 months later are smaller for boys than for girls. The gender difference in estimated impacts from birth to anthropometric health is attributed to food consumption patterns that favour boys. Our results have policy implications for tracking health outcomes during early childhood using birth and anthropometric health, especially by gender. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - The lockdown and de-escalation process following the COVID-19 pandemic led to a period of new normality. This study aimed to assess the confinement impact on the mental health of peripartum women, as their psychological well-being may be particularly vulnerable and thus affect their offspring’s development. A cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted among women who gave birth during strict confinement (G0) and the new normality period (G1), in which a self-administered paper-based questionnaire assessed 15 contextual factors and the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). For each item, it was verified whether the positive screening rate differed in each confinement phase, and a risk factor study was conducted. For G0, significantly higher positive screening and preterm birth rates were observed in the positive screening group. In the case of G1, maternal age (>35 years), decreased physical activity, and normal weight were found to be protective factors against distress. This study underscores the heightened mental health risk for postpartum women during major psychosocial upheavals (war, economic crisis, natural disasters, or pandemics), along with their resilience as the positive screening rate decreases with the new normality. Findings encourage adopting strategies to identify high-risk women and promote effective measures, such as promoting physical activity. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Buildings, parks, and roads are all elements of the “built environment,” which can be described as the human-made structures that comprise the neighborhoods and communities where people live, work, learn, and recreate (https://www.epa.gov/smm/basic-information-about-builtenvironment). The design of communities where children and adolescents live, learn, and play has a profound impact on their health. Moreover, the policies and practices that determine community design and the built environment are a root cause of disparities in the social determinants of health that contribute to health inequity. An understanding of the links between the built environment and pediatric health will help to inform pediatricians’ and other pediatric health professionals’ care for patients and advocacy on their behalf. This technical report describes the range of pediatric physical and mental health conditions influenced by the built environment, as well as historical and persistent effects of the built environment on health disparities. The accompanying policy statement outlines community design solutions that can improve pediatric health and health equity, including opportunities for pediatricians and the health care sector to incorporate this knowledge in patient care, as well as to play a role in advancing a health-promoting built environment for all children and families. © © 2024 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - Rationale: Adverse health impacts from outdoor air pollution occur across the United States, but the magnitude of these impacts varies widely by geographic region. Ambient pollutant concentrations, emission sources, baseline health conditions, and population sizes and distributions are all important factors that need to be taken into account to quantify local health burdens. Objectives: To determine health impacts from ambient air pollution concentrations in the United States that exceed the levels recommended by the American Thoracic Society. Methods: Using a methodology that has been well established in previous “Health of the Air” reports, this study provides policy-relevant estimates for every monitored county and city in the United States for the adverse health impacts of outdoor pollution concentrations using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency design values for years 2018–2020. Additionally, for the first time, the report includes adverse birth outcomes as well as estimates of health impacts specifically attributable to wildland fires using an exposure dataset generated through Community Multiscale Air Quality simulations. Results: The adverse health burdens attributable to air pollution occur across the entire age spectrum, including adverse birth outcomes (10,660 preterm and/or low-weight births; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3,180–18,330), in addition to mortality impacts (21,300 avoidable deaths; 95% CI, 16,180–26,200), lung cancer incidence (3,000 new cases; 95% CI, 1,550–4,390), multiple types of cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity (748,660 events; 95% CI, 326,050–1,057,080), and adversely impacted days (52.4 million days; 95% CI, 7.9–92.4 million days). Two different estimates of mortality impacts from wildland fires were created based on assumptions regarding the underlying toxicity of particles from wildland fires (low estimate of 4,080 deaths, 95% CI, 240–7,890; middle estimate of 28,000 deaths, 95% CI, 27,300–28,700). Conclusions: This year’s report identified sizable health benefits that would be expected to occur across the United States with compliance with more health-protective air quality standards such as those recommended by the American Thoracic Society. This study also indicates that a large number of excess deaths are attributable to emissions from wildland fires; air quality management strategies outside what is required by the Clean Air Act will be needed to best address this important source of air pollution and its associated health risks. © 2024 by the American Thoracic Society.

AB  - Storms are one of the most frequent natural hazards and are expected to become more extreme as climate change proceeds. This paper investigates storms classified as disasters and infant mortality in the Philippines. Data from the Philippine Demographic and Health Surveys from 2003, 2008, and 2017 are combined with data on storms from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and the Geocoded Disasters Dataset. Storms included in EM-DAT are disasters with human and economic impact on the population. The lagged and immediate impact of storms are considered by including disasters occurring from five years prior to birth to two months after birth. The data are analysed with linear probability models and mother fixed-effects. The results show limited or no association between storms and infant mortality, which reflects a positive overall development in the Philippines over recent years. Improvements in disaster management systems are likely to have made communities and households more resilient. © 2023 The Author

AB  - Purpose of reviewThe consequences of climate change, including heat and extreme weather events impact kidney function in adults and children. The impacts of climate change on kidney development during gestation and thereby on kidney function later in life have been poorly described. Clinical evidence is summarized to highlight possible associations between climate change and nephron mass.Recent findingsPregnant women are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, being less able to thermoregulate, more sensitive to the effects of dehydration, and more susceptible to infections. Exposure to heat, wildfire smoke, drought, floods and climate-related infections are associated with low birth weight, preterm birth and preeclampsia. These factors are associated with reduced nephron numbers, kidney dysfunction and higher blood pressures in offspring in later life. Exposure to air pollution is associated with higher blood pressures in children and has variable effects on estimated glomerular filtration rate.SummaryClimate change has important impacts on pregnant women and their unborn children. Being born too small or too soon is associated with life-time risk of kidney disease. Climate change may therefore have a dual effect of impacting fetal kidney development and contributing to cumulative postnatal kidney injury. The impact on population kidney health of future generations may be significant. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Can emergency vitrification protect embryos and oocytes during natural disasters or other events that prevent normal practice to achieve satisfactory embryonic development and clinical outcomes at a later time? SUMMARY ANSWER: Emergency vitrification of oocytes and Day 0–Day 5 (D0–D5) embryos during disasters is a safe and effective protective measure. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: When some destructive events such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other accidents occur, emergency vitrification in embryo laboratories to protect human embryos, oocytes, and sperm is one of the important measures of an IVF emergency plan. However, there are few detailed reports on emergency vitrification in a state of disaster, especially about oocytes and D0 zygotes. Therefore, the effectiveness and safety of emergency vitrification of oocytes and D0–D5 embryos in disaster states are still unclear. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective study was made in the Reproductive Medicine Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2018 to November 2022. The record rainstorms in Zhengzhou, China, caused severe flooding, traffic disruptions, and power outages. From 17:30, 20 July 2021 to 17:30, 21 July 2021, 1246 oocytes and D0–D5 embryos of 155 patients were vitrified whilst the laboratory had only an emergency power supply. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: As of 21 December 2021, 1149 emergency vitrified oocytes and D0–D5 embryos of 124 patients underwent frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET). They were divided into the following four groups according to the days of embryo culture in vitro: oocyte group, Day 0–Day 1 (D0–D1) group, Day 2–Day 3 (D2–D3) group, and Day 4–Day 5 (D4–D5) group. Control groups for each were selected from fresh cycle patients who underwent IVF/ICSI from January 2018 to October 2021. Control and emergency vitrification patients were matched on criteria that included age, fertilization method, days of embryonic development, and number and grade of transferred embryos. A total of 493 control patients were randomly selected from the eligible patients and matched with the emergency vitrification groups in a ratio of 4:1. The results of assisted reproduction and follow-up of pregnancy were analyzed. The embryonic development, clinical outcomes, and birth outcomes in each group were statistically analyzed. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A significant difference was observed in fertilization rate (81% versus 72%, P ¼ 0.022) between the oocyte group and the control group. Significant differences were also observed in the monozygotic twin pregnancy rate (10% versus 0%, P ¼ 0.038) and ectopic pregnancy rate (5% versus 0%, P ¼ 0.039) between the D0–D1 group and the control group. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed between vitrified oocytes/D0–D1 embryos/D2–D3 embryos and the control group on the number of high-quality embryos (3.17 ± 3.00 versus 3.84 ± 3.01, P ¼ 0.346; 5.04 ± 3.66 versus 4.56 ± 2.87, P ¼ 0.346; 4.85 ± 5.36 versus 5.04 ± 4.64, P ¼ 0.839), the number of usable blastocysts (1.22 ± 1.78 versus 1.21 ± 2.03, P ¼ 0.981; 2.16 ± 2.26 versus 1.55 ± 2.08, P ¼ 0.090; 2.82 ± 3.23 versus 2.58 ± 3.32, P ¼ 0.706), clinical pregnancy rate (56% versus 57%, P ¼ 0.915; 55% versus 55%, P ¼ 1.000; 40% versus 50%, P ¼ 0.488), miscarriage rate (30% versus 15%, P ¼ 0.496; 5% versus 11%, P ¼ 0.678; 17% versus 20%, P ¼ 1.000), and live birth rate (39% versus 49%, P ¼ 0.460; 53% versus 50%, P ¼ 0.772; 33% versus 40%, P ¼ 0.635). No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed between the D4–D5 group and the control group on clinical pregnancy rate (40% versus 55%, P ¼ 0.645), miscarriage rate (0% versus 18%, P ¼ 1.000), and live birth rate (40% versus 45%, P ¼ 1.000) LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The retrospective study design is a limitation. The timing and extent of natural disasters are unpredictable, so the sample size of vitrified oocytes, zygotes, and embryos is beyond experimental control. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study is the first study analyzing embryonic development, clinical outcomes, and birth outcomes of large samples of oocytes, D0 zygotes, and D1–D5 embryos after emergency vitrification under the disaster conditions. The results show that emergency vitrification is a safe and effective protective measure applicable to oocytes and D0–D5 embryos. The embryology laboratories need to be equipped with an emergency uninterrupted power supply capable of delivering for 6–8 h at full load.

AB  - Legacies of racial capitalism and colonialism drive present day racial disparities in perinatal health outcomes. Climate change amplifies existing social inequalities associated with environmental exposures and reproductive health, of which BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) communities bear a disproportionate burden. Through case studies, this article summarizes three examples of climate justice issues with reproductive healthcare outcomes: traffic related air pollution exposure, chemical exposures in personal care products and plastics, and natural disaster frequency. We advocate for incorporation of climate justice and environmental health impact into medical school curriculum, increased prenatal screening for environmental toxins, and physician engagement with local environmental issues. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Evidence is accumulating, both in the US and abroad, of the apparent serious health impacts of various environmental exposures tied to climate change. High ambient temperature, or heat, is a worsening global health risk. Heat risk is affected by many factors such as the magnitude, duration, and timing of exposure – such as specific, critical windows during pregnancy. This article focuses on the association of heat with both adverse pregnancy and newborn health outcomes. Regarding pregnancy, studies link heat and preterm birth, low birth weight and stillbirth. Multiple potential mechanisms support the biological plausibility of these associations. Emerging evidence suggests that heat, via epigenetics, may affect maternal health far beyond pregnancy. For newborn health impacts, heat is associated with increased hospitalization, neurologic and gastrointestinal dysfunction, and infant death. Research gaps include the need to study neonates separately from children and determining the mechanisms linking heat to adverse outcomes. We also highlight disparate adverse reproductive health outcomes for communities of color and low income tied to disproportionate exposures to environmental stressors like heat. Finally, we summarize educational and clinical tool resources for clinicians, information for patients, and opportunities for near-term action using the precautionary principle framework. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Although the earth's climate has been continuously changing over billions of years, human influence has accelerated that rate of change. While high latitudes suffer the greatest increase in incremental temperature, moderate latitudes are highly vulnerable due to their temperate/tropical rain storms and hurricanes that bring about extreme flooding events. We and others have shown that there is a link between the occurrence and severity of these climate events and risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. In this review, we will discuss the data and consider interacting near and intermediate sequelae of worsening natural disasters–including food scarcity, disrupted or compromised built environments and infrastructure, and loss of communities with human migration. While certainly tackling these and other proximal mediators of adverse perinatal outcomes will benefit maternal and child health, a failure to meaningfully address the root causes of climate change and resultant environmental chemical exposures will be of little long-term benefit. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Objectives: Pregnant women are vulnerable to the health consequences of earthquakes, experiencing stress and limited access to healthcare. Despite the widespread impact of these events, knowledge about their effects on pregnancy outcomes is scarce and inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the available evidence, estimate the overall effect, and identify key research gaps about earthquake on pregnant women. Study Design: A comprehensive search of English-language peer-reviewed articles was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection. Various combinations of keywords related to earthquakes and pregnancy outcomes were used. Studies comparing quantitative data on pregnancy outcomes between earthquake-affected and unaffected pregnant women were included. Random and fixed-effects models were used to estimate the pooled effect size. Results: The meta-analysis revealed no significant difference in preterm delivery rates (OR: 1.18; 95 % CI: 0.94–1.47; I2 = 75 %; five studies, 26,365 women) and low birth weight (LBW) infant delivery rates (OR: 1.19; 95 % CI: 0.83–1.71; I2 = 72 %; three studies, 16,127 women) between the earthquake-affected and control groups. However, a statistically significant increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants was observed in the earthquake-affected group (OR: 1.25; 95 % CI: 1.08–1.43; I2 = 0 %; two studies, 10,238 women). Data on miscarriage and stillbirth rates were not suitable for meta-analysis. Conclusions: Limited evidence suggests that exposure to earthquakes may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm the increased risk of SGA in the affected population and to inform disaster management plans by enhancing our understanding of the adversities associated with earthquake exposure through more comprehensive epidemiologic research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Exposure to wildfires and health outcomes of vulnerable people: Evidence from US data
AU  - Zheng, J.
T2  - Economics and Human Biology
PY  - 2023
VL  - 51
AB  - This paper investigates the causal effect of wildfire exposure on birth outcomes and older people's health outcomes in United States (US). The study focuses on three sub-questions for each health outcome: (1) the causal effect of each of the five largest wildfires on individual health, (2) the causal impact of multiple large wildfires on individual health outcomes, and (3) the causal influence of wildfires larger than different sizes within different distances of counties on health outcomes at the county level. The analysis exploits data from National Vital Statistics System, Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System and FIRESTAT. In terms of birth outcomes, the findings show that the largest wildfire slightly increased the risk of other circulatory or respiratory anomalies. Multiple large wildfires moderately raised the risk of prematurity and led to a small decline in the probability of getting omphalocele and cleft lip. The county-level analysis suggests an increased risk of macrosomia following maternal exposure to wildfires. As for the elderly aged 65 +, the results indicate that exposure to multiple massive wildfires led to frequent occurrence of asthma symptoms, while the largest wildfire led to sleeping difficulty caused by asthma symptoms. The number of days older people experienced psychological problems was increased following exposure to multiple large wildfires. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Due to its high pervasiveness and adversarial consequences, postpartum anxiety has been one of the most worrying public health concerns in the last decade. According to previous research, the occurrence of mental disorders among women in the postpartum period upsurges significantly in the course of universal disasters. The Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale – Research Short Form – for use in global Crises [PSAS-IR-RSF-C] has not been used in Iran for postpartum women during a health system shock. Consequently, this study was conducted to determine the validity and reliability of the Persian version (PSAS-IR-RSF-C) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed with 180 women who were between six weeks and six months after delivery, by random sampling method from December 2021 to June 2022. The validity of the PSAS-RSF-C in terms of face, content, was analyzed, and the construct validity was assessed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Internal consistency and test–retest reliability of the questionnaire were measured using (Cronbach’s alpha, McDonald’s ω) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), respectively. Results: The content validity index and content validity ratio of the Persian version of the PSAS-IR-RSF-C were 0.96 and 0.98, respectively. A three-factor structure was extracted during the exploratory factor analysis process, and model validity was confirmed by the values of fit indices. Cronbach's alpha coefficient, McDonald’s ω and intra-cluster correlation coefficient (95% confidence interval) were 0.74, 0.92 (0.78 to 0.93) and 0.97 (0.93 to 0.98), respectively. Conclusions: For the specific assessment of postpartum anxiety among Iranian women during crises, the Persian version of the PSAS-IR-RSF-C is a valid and reliable tool. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting disadvantaged populations, with greater representation and worse outcomes in low socioeconomic and minority populations, and in persons from marginalized groups. General health care system approaches to inequity reduction (i.e., the minimization of differences in health and health care which are considered unfair or unjust), address the major social determinants of health, such as low income, ethnic affiliation or remote place of residents. Yet, to effectively reduce inequity there is a need for a multifactorial consideration of the aspects that intersect and generate significant barriers to effective care that can address the unique situations that people face due to their gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic situation. Main body: To address the health equity challenges of diverse population groups in Israel, we propose to adopt an intersectional approach, allowing to better identify the needs and then better tailor the infection prevention and control modalities to those who need them the most. We focus on the two main ethnic – cultural—religious minority groups, that of Arab Palestinian citizens of Israel and Jewish ultra-orthodox (Haredi) communities. Additionally, we address the unique needs of persons with severe mental illness who often experience an intersection of clinical and sociodemographic risks. Conclusions: This perspective highlights the need for responses to COVID-19, and future pandemic or global disasters, that adopt the unique lens of intersectionality and equity. This requires that the government and health system create multiple messages, interventions and policies which ensure a person and community tailored approach to meet the needs of persons from diverse linguistic, ethnic, religious, socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. Under-investment in intersectional responses will lead to widening of gaps and a disproportionate disease and mortality burden on societies’ most vulnerable groups. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To assess the level of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) disaster preparedness among pediatric residents. Methods: A mixed-methods study including qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys was used. Interviews guided survey development. Surveys were distributed to residents who rotated through Children's National NICU. Questions assessed residents' background in disaster preparedness, disaster protocol knowledge, NICU preparedness, roles during surge and evacuation, and views on training and education. Results: Survey response was 62.5% (n = 80) with 51.3% of invited residents completing it. Pediatric residents (PGY-2 and PGY-3) (n = 41) had low levels of individual disaster preparedness, particularly evacuations (86%). None were aware of specific NICU disaster protocols. Patient acuity, role ambiguity, knowledge, and training deficits were major contributors to unpreparedness. Residents viewed their role as system facilitators (eg, performing duties assigned, recruiting other residents, and clerical work like documentation). Resident training requests included disaster preparedness training every NICU rotation (48%) using multidisciplinary simulations (66%), role definition (56%), and written protocols (50%). Despite their unpreparedness, residents (84%) were willing to respond. Conclusion: Pediatric residents lacked knowledge of NICU disaster response but were willing to respond to disasters. Training should include multi-disciplinary simulations that can be refined iteratively to clarify roles, and residents should be involved in planning and execution. © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - Lineage-specific genes (LSGs) have long been postulated to play roles in the establishment of genetic barriers to intercrossing and speciation. In the genome of Neurospora crassa, most of the 670 Neurospora LSGs that are aggregated adjacent to the telomeres are clustered with 61% of the HET-domain genes, some of which regulate self-recognition and define vegetative incompatibility groups. In contrast, the LSG-encoding proteins possess few to no domains that would help to identify potential functional roles. Possible functional roles of LSGs were further assessed by performing transcriptomic profiling in genetic mutants and in response to environmental alterations, as well as examining gene knockouts for phenotypes. Among the 342 LSGs that are dynamically expressed during both asexual and sexual phases, 64% were detectable on unusual carbon sources such as furfural, a wildfire-produced chemical that is a strong inducer of sexual development, and the structurally-related furan 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF). Expression of a significant portion of the LSGs was sensitive to light and temperature, factors that also regulate the switch from asexual to sexual reproduction. Furthermore, expression of the LSGs was significantly affected in the knockouts of adv-1 and pp-1 that regulate hyphal communication, and expression of more than one quarter of the LSGs was affected by perturbation of the mating locus. These observations encouraged further investigation of the roles of clustered lineage-specific and HET-domain genes in ecology and reproduction regulation in Neurospora, especially the regulation of the switch from the asexual growth to sexual reproduction, in response to dramatic environmental conditions changes. © 2023 Wang et al.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Does the exposure to job loss during pregnancy increase the risk of miscarriage or stillbirth? SUMMARY ANSWER: The experience of own or partner’s job loss during the pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Prior research on the psycho-social aspect of pregnancy loss has investigated the contextual and the individual-level stressors. At the contextual level, natural disasters, air pollution, and economic downturns are associated with higher risk of pregnancy loss. At the individual level, intense working schedules and financial strain are linked with increased risk of pregnancy loss both at early and later stages of the gestation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This work draws on high-quality individual data of ‘Understanding Society’, a longitudinal survey that has interviewed a representative sample of households living in the UK annually since 2009. Approximately 40 000 households were recruited. The analyses use all the available survey waves (1–12, 2009–2022). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The final sample consisted of 8142 pregnancy episodes that contain complete information on pregnancy outcome and date of conception. Ongoing pregnancies at the time of the interview were excluded from the final sample. The outcome variable indicated whether a pregnancy resulted in a live birth or a pregnancy loss whereas the exposure variable identified the women’s or their partner’s job loss because of redundancy or a dismissal. Logistic regression models were employed to estimate the relation between job loss during pregnancy and pregnancy loss. The models were adjusted for an array of socio-demographic and economic characteristics following a stepwise approach. Several sensitivity analyses complemented the main findings. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Baseline models controlling for women’s demographic background and prior experience of miscarriage estimated an increased risk of pregnancy loss when women were exposed to their own or their partner’s job loss during their pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) ¼ 1.99, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.99). When the models were adjusted for all socio-economic and partnership-related covariates the association remained robust (OR ¼ 1.81, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.73). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: First, the pregnancy outcome and the date of conception were self-reported and may be subjected to recall and social desirability bias. Second, although we adjusted for an array socio-demographic characteristics and self-reported health, other contextual factors might be correlated with both job loss and pregnancy loss. Third, owing to the limited sample size, we could not assess if the main finding holds across different socio-economic strata. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: By showing that exposure to a job loss during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth, we underline the relevance of pregnancy loss as a preventable public health matter. This result also calls for policy design that enhances labour market protection and social security buffers for pregnant women and their partners.

AB  - Background: Gastroschisis prevalence more than doubled between 1995 and 2012. While there are individual-level risk factors (e.g., young maternal age, low body mass index), the impact of environmental exposures is not well understood. Methods: We used the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Quality Index (EQI) as a county-level estimate of cumulative environmental exposures for five domains (air, water, land, sociodemographic, and built) and overall from 2006 to 2010. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated from logistic regression models between EQI tertiles (better environmental quality (reference); mid; poorer) and gastroschisis in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study from births delivered between 2006 and 2011. Our analysis included 594 cases with gastroschisis and 4105 infants without a birth defect (controls). Results: Overall EQI was modestly associated with gastroschisis (aOR [95% CI]: 1.29 [0.98, 1.71]) for maternal residence in counties with poorer environmental quality, compared to the reference (better environmental quality). Within domain-specific indices, only the sociodemographic domain (aOR: 1.51 [0.99, 2.29]) was modestly associated with gastroschisis, when comparing poorer to better environmental quality. Conclusions: Future work could elucidate pathway(s) by which components of the sociodemographic domain or possibly related psychosocial factors like chronic stress potentially contribute to risk of gastroschisis. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic brings to light similarities to the 1918 influenza pandemic, one of the deadliest outbreaks in United States history. The work of the Henry Street Visiting Nurse Service also referred to the public health nurses for that time, was a critical part of the New York City response. This case study examined Lillian Wald's leadership in directing the public health nursing response in New York City during the second wave of the influenza pandemic, from September through December of 1918. A historical social framework was used. Primary sources included the Lillian Wald Papers in the Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Columbia University in New York, Wald's (1934) Windows on Henry Street, medical, public health and nursing documents, journals, and newspaper articles published during the early 20th century. Secondary source material include works by historians Sarah Abrams, Arlene Keeling, Karen Buhler-Wilkerson, Sandra Lewenson, John Barry, and Alfred Crosby. Key findings included developing a community wide strategic plan, using data driven decisions, implementing visiting nursing services, teaching in the home, and maintaining a diverse workforce. Lessons learned can guide leadership in emergency planning, system change, infection control and disease prevention, all familiar practices of public health nursing. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Background: Past research on the impact of climatic events, such as drought, on birth outcomes has primarily been focused in Africa, with less research in South Asia, including Nepal. Existing evidence has generally found that drought impacts birthweight and infant sex, with differences by trimester. Additionally, less research has looked at the impact of excess rain on birth outcomes or focused on the impact of rainfall extremes in the preconception period. Using data from a large demographic surveillance system in Nepal, combined with a novel measure of drought/excess rainfall, we explore the impact of these on birthweight by time in pregnancy. Methods: Using survey data from the 2016 to 2019 Chitwan Valley Study in rural Nepal combined with data from Climate Hazards InfraRed Precipitation with Station, we explored the association between excess rainfall and drought and birthweight, looking at exposure in the preconception period, and by trimester of pregnancy. We also explore the impact of excess rainfall and drought on infant sex and delivery with a skilled birth attendant. We used multilevel regressions and explored for effect modification by maternal age. Results: Drought in the first trimester is associated with lower birthweight (β = -82.9 g; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 164.7, -1.2) and drought in the preconception period with a high likelihood of having a male (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.01, 2.01). Excess rainfall in the first trimester is associated with high birthweight (β = 111.6 g; 95% CI = 20.5, 202.7) and higher odds of having a male (OR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.02, 2.16), and in the third trimester with higher odds of low birth weight (OR = 2.50; 95% CI = 1.40, 4.45). Conclusions: Increasing rainfall extremes will likely impact birth outcomes and could have implications for sex ratios at birth. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research documenting the public health impacts of natural disasters often focuses on adults and children. Little research has examined the influence of extreme events, like floods, on maternal health, and less has examined the effect of disasters on maternal indicators like severe maternal morbidity (SMM) or unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery. The aim of this study is to identify the impacts of the 2015 flood events on maternal health outcomes in South Carolina, USA. We employ a quasi-experimental design using a difference-in-difference analysis with log-binomial regressions to evaluate outcomes for impacted and control locations during the disaster event. Unlike previous studies, we extended our difference-in-difference analysis to include a trimester of exposure to assess the timing of flood exposure. We did not find evidence of statistically significant main effects on maternal health from the 2015 flood events related to preterm birth, gestational diabetes, mental disorders of pregnancy, depression, and generalized anxiety. However, we did find a statistically significant increase in SMM and low birth weight during the flood event for women in select trimester periods who were directly exposed. Our work provides new evidence on the effects of extreme flood events, like the 2015 floods, which can impact maternal health during specific exposure periods of pregnancy. Additional research is needed across other extreme weather events, as the unique context of the 2015 floods limits the generalizability of our findings. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: This study was undertaken to assess the health status of newborns discharged from Sick Newborn Care Units (SNCU) of the Cyclone Fani affected districts of Odisha, which is amongst the highest neonatal mortality rate states in the country. Methods: Cyclone Fani hit the coast of Odisha on May 3, 2019. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 5 districts and targeted the babies discharged from SNCU's from January to May 2019. A telephonic interview of the caregivers was conducted to assess the health status of the newborns. Data was collected in a web-based portal and analyzed by statistical package for social sciences SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). Results: We inquired about 1840 babies during the study period but only 875 babies could be followed up, with the highest proportion of the babies from the most affected district. Out of 875 babies, 111 (12.7%) had 1 or more illnesses during follow up. Distance from the health facility and time constraints were the major reasons for not seeking health care. Of the babies, 35.7% were reported as being underweight. Poor breastfeeding (14.1%) and kangaroo mother care (31.7%) practices were reported. Only 32% of the babies were completely immunized. Conclusion: The health status of the babies discharged from the SNCUs was found to be poor. Newborn care can be strengthened by improving home-based and facility-based newborn care. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Introduction: In the recent past, due to the pandemic and humanitarian crisis, the healthcare system has dived into turmoil, especially regarding core facilities for women and maternal health. Afghanistan has the highest maternal mortality rate globally according to the WHO. Methodology: Extensive research was performed regarding maternal health crises in Afghanistan using appropriate keywords. The inclusion criteria were case reports, case studies, systematic reviews and original articles in English. Implications of current crises on the problem: In such a decrepit system, regime changes resulted in major donors withdrawing from the national primary care service program leading to serious consequences for Afghani. Challenges: Major challenges faced by the Afghan healthcare system include the cessation of international funding due to the humanitarian crisis, the shortage of medicines and the failure to deliver salaries to healthcare workers. More than 90% of healthcare facilities are at risk of closure, leading to an estimated 4.8 million unattended pregnancies and 51,000 maternal deaths between 2021 and 2025. Current efforts: To ensure such a catastrophe does not arise, the World Bank, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and UNFPA in collaboration with governments around the world have pledged aid, both monetary and in terms of equipment & resources to Afghanistan. Recommendations: Local Afghan organizations such as the AHDS and JACK must also be supported to further their work in providing healthcare services. Conclusion: The health system in Afghanistan, particularly maternal health, has suffered greatly in the last two years and therefore, if no aid or funding is provided, a disaster is bound to occur. © 2023

AB  - Recruitment is one of the fundamental drivers of ungulate population dynamics. Recruitment of neonates into an ungulate population can be influenced by a wide range of abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic factors. Our objective was to examine which environmental variables most influenced pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) fawn recruitment, as measured by fawn:doe ratios, across six subpopulations in Idaho spanning 35 years (1984–2018) of herd composition surveys. Using a retrospective analysis, we examined the influence of precipitation, minimum and maximum temperatures, Palmer drought severity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation, and elevation across five biological time periods of interest (one and two months pre-parturition, one and two months post-parturition, and breeding). Environmental factors, especially the variance in the greenness of vegetation (i.e., NDVI) during the two months post-parturition (during lactation), were the main drivers of fawn recruitment for subpopulations occupying mountain valleys. Pronghorn fawn recruitment in these mountain valleys was dependent on the condition of the lactating female as influenced by the quality of vegetation, which would subsequently influence fawn growth rates. In contrast, pronghorn recruitment at lower elevations was driven by several environmental variables (i.e., NDVI, drought severity, minimum and maximum temperatures, forb, and grass cover) during the month pre-parturition. Environmental variables at lower elevations were influencing the condition of the female during gestation which, if favorable, would result in higher birth weights and subsequent increased fawn survival. At intermediate elevation sites, results were mixed with fawn recruitment at one site influenced by low temperatures, which could induce hypothermia in fawns, while recruitment at the other site was influenced by drought severity during gestation (two months pre-parturition). Influence of these environmental variables was also related to the timing of pronghorn arriving at the high elevation sites (i.e., arriving just prior to fawning); hence, effects were predominantly post-parturition. In contrast, low elevation sites either had resident pronghorn or earlier arrival; thereby, effects on fawn recruitment were mostly from pre-parturition variables. Given the range of environmental factors influencing pronghorn subpopulations, managers will need to consider the timing, intensity, and variability of environmental conditions as conditions were spatially and temporally explicit. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Heat exposure in pregnancy is associated with a range of adverse health and wellbeing outcomes, yet research on the lived experience of pregnancy in high temperatures is lacking. We conducted qualitative research in 2021 in two communities in rural Kilifi County, Kenya, a tropical savannah area currently experiencing severe drought. Pregnant and postpartum women, their male spouses and mothers-in-law, community health volunteers, and local health and environment stakeholders were interviewed or participated in focus group discussions. Pregnant women described symptoms that are classically regarded as heat exhaustion, including dizziness, fatigue, dehydration, insomnia, and irritability. They interpreted heat-related tachycardia as signalling hypertension and reported observing more miscarriages and preterm births in the heat. Pregnancy is conceptualised locally as a ‘normal’ state of being, and women continue to perform physically demanding household chores in the heat, even when pregnant. Women reported little support from family members to reduce their workload at this time, reflecting their relative lack of autonomy within the household, but also potentially the ‘normalisation’ of heat in these communities. Climate change risk reduction strategies for pregnant women in low-resource settings need to be cognisant of local household gender dynamics that constrain women's capacity to avoid heat exposures. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Due to global warming, an increased number of open fires is becoming a major contributor to PM<inf>2.5</inf> pollution and thus a threat to public health. However, the burden of stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> is unknown. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is a co-occurrence of high baseline stillbirth rates and frequent firestorms, which may lead to a geographic disparity. Across 54 LMICs, we conducted a self-matched case-control study, making stillbirths comparable to the corresponding livebirths in terms of time-invariant characteristics (e.g., genetics) and duration of gestational exposure. We established a joint-exposure-response function (JERF) by simultaneously associating stillbirth with fire- and non-fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations, which were estimated by fusing multi-source data, such as chemical transport model simulations and satellite observations. During 2000–2014, 35,590 pregnancies were selected from multiple Demographic and Health Surveys. In each mother, a case of stillbirth was compared to her livebirth(s) based on gestational exposure to fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf>. We further applied the JERF to assess stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> in 136 non-Western countries. The disparity was evaluated using the Gini index. The risk of stillbirth increased by 17.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6–35.7%) per 10 μg/m3 increase in fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf>. In 2014, referring to a minimum-risk exposure level of 10 μg/m3, total and fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> contributed to 922,860 (95% CI: 578,451–1,183,720) and 49,951 (95% CI: 3,634–92,629) stillbirths, of which 10% were clustered within the 6.4% and 0.6% highest-exposure pregnancies, respectively. The Gini index of stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> was 0.65, much higher than for total PM<inf>2.5</inf> (0.28). Protecting pregnant women against PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposure during wildfires is critical to avoid stillbirths, as the burden of fire-associated stillbirths leads to a geographic disparity in maternal health. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For policies and programs aiming at reducing climate risk, it is important to obtain vulnerability information at the sub-national level to identify hotspots. For the case of Costa Rica, no sub-national climate vulnerability index exists to date. To fill this gap, we constructed a climate vulnerability index at the canton level. We ground our work in the conceptual framework that vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Making extensive use of geographic information systems and publicly available data, we constructed 13 spatial layers to reflect the multi-dimensionality of vulnerability. Layers reflect for example, changes in climatic extremes, flood risk, vegetation cover, access to infrastructure (road density) and health services (distance to hospitals), as well as various socioeconomic (wealth level, employment rates, remittances, literacy rate) and demographic (infant mortality) characteristics. Following normalization, we constructed an inverse variance weighted index of canton-level climate vulnerability. We confirmed the validity of our climate vulnerability index through correlation with disaster damage data. We find the strongest climate vulnerability not only in the rural, agricultural producing border cantons (Los Chiles, Matina, Talamanca, Buenos Aires), but also for a few central urban cantons (Tibas, San Jose). Projects and interventions in these hot spot cantons may reduce sensitivity through strengthening hydrological infrastructure and economic development, while adaptive capacity may be improved through addressing barriers of remittance transfer, and via public health programs. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: Evacuations of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in emergency situations pose specialized challenges given their population of critically-ill neonates. Most of the literature on this topic describes planned evacuations and simulations due to natural disasters, usually involving only NICU staff. This study examines a unique emergent NICU evacuation simulation involving multiple responders occurring on a citywide scale. Methods: A simulated evacuation in response to a fire was conducted in 6 different NICUs in El Paso, Texas. The exercise utilized response from NICU staff and first responders. A standardized tool, by independent evaluators, was used to evaluate staff competencies while reactions were assessed using post-exercise surveys. Results: This city-wide multidisciplinary simulation improved NICU personnel skills in evacuation and also introduced first responders to this specialized patient population. Areas of strength across all NICUs included teamwork, knowledge of evacuation equipment, and patient tracking. Areas for improvement included lack of adequate equipment for post-evacuation care, understanding implications of smoke exposure, alternative evacuation routes, incident command structure, and unified communication. Conclusions: This successful, citywide NICU evacuation simulation improved knowledge among participants, introduced first responders to a specialized patient population, and provided valuable lessons on neonate-specific themes that can be incorporated to improve citywide emergency preparedness. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Information regarding the longitudinal effects of natural/environmental disasters on obstetrics outcomes is limited. This study aimed to analyze the longitudinal changes in obstetrics outcomes over 8 years after the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima power plant accident. We used data from the first 8 years of the Pregnancy and Birth Survey by the Fukushima prefectural government, launched in 2011. We compared data on obstetrics outcomes by year and divided Fukushima Prefecture into six districts based on administrative districts. Longitudinal changes in the occurrence of preterm birth before 37 gestational weeks, low birth weight, and anomalies in newborns were accessed using the Mantel–Haenszel test for trends in all six districts. Overall, 57,537 participants were included. In 8 years, maternal age, conception rate after sterility treatment, and cesarean section delivery incidence increased. Although significant differences were observed in preterm birth and low birth weight occurrence among districts, there was no significant trend in the occurrence of preterm birth, low birth weight, and anomalies in newborns in all six districts of Fukushima Prefecture. The Great East Japan Earthquake and Fukushima power plant accident were associated with increased cesarean section delivery incidence but had no significant adverse effects on obstetrics outcomes. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: More intense cyclones are expected in the future as a result of climate change. A comprehensive review is urgently needed to summa-rize and update the evidence on the health effects of cyclones. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to provide a systematic review with meta-analysis of current evidence on the risks of all reported health outcomes related to cyclones and to identify research gaps and make recommendations for further research. METHODS: We systematically searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies in English published before 21 December 2022. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guide-lines, we developed inclusion criteria, screened the literature, and included epidemiological studies with a quantitative risk assessment of any mortality or morbidity-related outcomes associated with cyclone exposures. We extracted key data and assessed study quality for these studies and applied meta-analyses to quantify the overall effect estimate and the heterogeneity of comparable studies. RESULTS: In total, 71 studies from eight countries (the United States, China, India, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Australia, Brazil), mostly the United States, were included in the review. These studies investigated the all-cause and cause-specific mortality, as well as morbidity related to injury, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, mental disorders, adverse birth outcomes, cancer, diabetes, and other outcomes (e.g., suicide rates, gender-based violence). Studies mostly included only one high-amplitude cyclone (cyclones with a Saffir–Simpson category of 4 or 5, i.e., Hurricanes Katrina or Sandy) and focused on mental disorders morbidity and all-cause mortality and hospitalizations. Consistently elevated risks of overall mental health morbidity, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as all-cause mortality or hospitalizations, were found to be associated with cyclones. However, the results for other outcomes were generally mixed or limited. A statistically significant overall relative risk of 1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.13], 1.18 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.25), 1.15 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.18), 1.26 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.50) was observed for all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalizations, respiratory disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospitalizations, respectively, after cyclone exposures, whereas no statistically significant risks were identified for diabetes mortality, heart disease mortality, and preterm birth. High between-study heterogeneity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: There is generally consistent evidence supporting the notion that high-amplitude cyclones could significantly increase risks of mental disorders, especially for PTSD, as well as mortality and hospitalizations, but the evidence for other health outcomes, such as chronic diseases (e.g., CVDs, cancer, diabetes), and adverse birth outcomes remains limited or inconsistent. More studies with rigorous exposure assessment, of larger spa-tial and temporal scales, and using advanced modeling strategy are warranted in the future, especially for those small cyclone-prone countries or regions with low and middle incomes. © 2023, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

AB  - Adverse environmental exposures in utero and early childhood are known to programme long-term health. Climate change, by contributing to severe heatwaves, wildfires, and other natural disasters, is plausibly associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and an increase in the future burden of chronic diseases in both mothers and their babies. In this Personal View, we highlight the limitations of existing evidence, specifically on the effects of severe heatwave and wildfire events, and compounding syndemic events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on the short-term and long-term physical and mental health of pregnant women and their babies, taking into account the interactions with individual and community vulnerabilities. We highlight a need for an international, interdisciplinary collaborative effort to systematically study the effects of severe climate-related environmental crises on maternal and child health. This will enable informed changes to public health policy and clinical practice necessary to safeguard the health and wellbeing of current and future generations. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The World Health Assembly resolution 68.15 recognised emergency and essential surgery as a critical component of universal health coverage. The first session of the three-part virtual meeting series on Strategic Planning to Improve Surgical, Obstetric, Anaesthesia, and Trauma Care in the Asia–Pacific Region focused on the current status of surgical care and opportunities for improvement. During this session, Ministries of Health and World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Directors shared country- and regional-level progress in surgical system strengthening. The WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) has developed an Action Framework for Safe and Affordable Surgery, whilst the WHO South-East Asia Regional Office (SEARO) highlighted their efforts in emergency obstetric care, workforce strengthening, and blood safety. Numerous countries have begun developing and implementing National Surgical, Obstetric, and Anaesthesia Plans (NSOAPs). Participants agreed surgical system strengthening is an integral component of universal health coverage, pandemic preparedness, and overall health system resilience. Participants discussed common challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, workforce capacity building, and improving access for hard-to-reach populations. They generated and shared common solutions, including strengthening surgical care capacity in first-level hospitals, anaesthesia task-shifting, remote training, and integrating surgical care with public health, preventive care, and emergency preparedness. Moving forward, participants committed to developing and implementing NSOAPs and agreed on the need to raise political awareness, build a broad-based movement, and form intersectoral collaborations. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: For 60 y, the people of Asubpeeschoseewagong Anishinabek (Grassy Narrows First Nation) have endured the effects of massive mercury (Hg) contamination of their river system, central to their traditions, culture, livelihood, and diet. In the years following the Hg discharge into the English–Wabigoon River system by a chloralkali plant in the early 1970s, there was a dramatic increase in youth suicides. Several authors attributed this increase solely to social disruption caused by the disaster. OBJECTIVE: This research examined the possible contribution of Hg exposure across three generations on attempted suicides among today’s children (5–11 y old) and youth (12–17 y old), using a matrilineal intergenerational paradigm. METHODS: Information from the 2016–2017 Grassy Narrows Community Health Assessment (GN-CHA) survey was merged with Hg biomonitoring data from government surveillance programs (1970–1997). Data from 162 children/youth (5–17 years of age), whose mothers (n = 80) had provided information on themselves, their parents, and children, were retained for analyses. Direct and indirect indicators of Hg exposure included a) grand-father had worked as a fishing guide, and b) mother’s measured and estimated umbilical cord blood and childhood hair Hg and her fish consumption during pregnancy with this child. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine significant links from grandparents (G0) to mothers’ exposure and mental health (G1) and children/youth (G2) risk for attempted suicide. RESULTS: Mothers’ (G1) median age was 33 y, 86.3% of grandmothers (G0) had lived in Grassy Narrows territory during their pregnancy, and 52.5% of grandfathers (G0) had worked as fishing guides. Sixty percent of children (G2) were <12 years of age. Mothers reported that among teenagers (G2: 12–17 years of age), 41.2% of girls and 10.7% of boys had ever attempted suicide. The SEM suggested two pathways that significantly linked grandparents (G0) to children’s (G2) attempted suicides: a) through mothers’ (G1) prenatal and childhood Hg exposure and psychological distress, and b) through maternal fish consumption during pregnancy (G1/G2), which is an important contributor to children’s emotional state and behavior. © 2023, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

AB  - Objective: Maternal health in pregnancy and birth outcomes were compared between pre- and post-Varzaghan earthquake. Methods: In this retrospective descriptive study, before and after the earthquake, 550 and 450 women were enrolled respectively. Neonatal weight, height, and head circumference, as well as maternal weight gain and hemoglobin (Hb) levels were obtained using medical records at health centers. Chi-square test and Independent t-test were used to analyze differences in pregnancy outcomes. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: A significant increase in inadequate gestational weight gain (44.1% vs 58.9%) was observed (P = 0.043) before and after the earthquake. The mean hemoglobin level in the first trimester before the earthquake was significantly higher than after the earthquake (P = 0.001). Before-after earthquake comparisons showed that the mean birth weight, birth height, and birth head circumference were decreased significantly (P < 0.05). In addition, the rates of preterm birth (18.91% vs 10.90%), abortion (17.11% vs 10.54%), and stillbirth (3.78% vs 1.82%) were increased significantly after the earthquake (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Earthquake causes inadequate gestational weight gain and decreased hemoglobin levels, which lead to adverse birth outcomes. More longitudinal and well-designed studies are desired to investigate the longitudinal consequences of disasters on susceptible groups. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Stress is an established seizure precipitant. Patients commonly report that stress can trigger their seizures, and prospective diary studies have demonstrated that seizures are more likely to occur during times of higher self-reported stress.1,2 Unfortunately, stress is a vague term. Certain stressors are ubiquitous, a part of everyday life, whereas others are more significant. Most studies exploring the relationship between stress and seizures do not provide insight into the nature or severity of the stressor. The exception is those examining seizure control during unprecedented crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, and terrorist attacks, during which many patients reported increased seizure frequency.2-4 © American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had significant negative impact on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) with devastating impact on pregnant women in resource constrain humanitarian settings. This paper provides detailed account of a community midwife-led intervention in ten humanitarian settings of Afghanistan using world health organization (WHO) emergency disaster risk management (EDRM) framework. Objectives: The project is aimed at increasing access to Integrated Package of Essential SRH Services and Minimal Initial Service Package (MISP) with a specific focus on prevention of Postpartum Haemorrhage (PPH) and screening and management of preeclampsia and eclampsia. Methods: The project was implemented through 150 Community outreach midwives (COMs). Each midwife served 300 households; mentored by gynaecologists and supervisors. Midwives were trained through a digitally enabled, simulation based training and equipped with a set of off-the shelf devices and kits. Results: During COVID-19 pandemic and in absence of health care services during crisis, this intervention has played as a lifesaving intervention for the community in Afghanistan. Variable digital literacy, sociocultural barriers, reluctance in adapting to digital platforms, security and uncertainties were some of the challenges faced. Adaptation of outreach methods integrated high impactful digital technologies has been the most appropriate strategy "to reach the unreached". Conclusion: Through this model, national and global stakeholders were engaged even during the crisis in Afghanistan. It also provided vital inputs for the donors, governments, civil society organizations and other stakeholders for sustaining and advancing the delivery of quality SRH services in humanitarian settings. © 2023, Kashan University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Background: During the summer of 2019/2020, Australia experienced a catastrophic wildfire season that affected nearly 80% of Australians either directly or indirectly. The impacts of climate crisis on perinatal health have only recently begun to receive attention. The objective of this study was to understand experiences of perinatal women during the bushfire and smoke events of 2019–2020 regarding health, health care, and public health messaging. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted by phone or web conferencing platforms with 43 participants living in the south-east of Australia who were either pregnant or who had recently had a baby during the 2019/2020 fires. Results: The health impacts on participants of the fires, associated smoke, and evacuations for some, were both physical and psychological. Many participants sought information regarding how to protect their own health and that of their unborn/recently born children, but reported this difficult to find. Conclusions: Pregnant women and new mothers exposed to bushfire events are a risk group for adverse physical and psychological outcomes. At the time of the 2019/2020 Australian bushfires, exposed women could not easily access evidence-based information to mitigate this risk. Family practitioners are well placed to provide pregnant women and new mothers with this sought-after information, but they need to be prepared well in advance of future similar events. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Global outdoor biomass burning is a major contributor to air pollution, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Recent years have witnessed substantial changes in the extent of biomass burning, including large declines in Africa. However, direct evidence of the contribution of biomass burning to global health outcomes remains limited. Here, we use georeferenced data on more than 2 million births matched to satellite-derived burned area exposure to estimate the burden of biomass fires on infant mortality. We find that each additional square kilometer of burning is associated with nearly 2% higher infant mortality in nearby downwind locations. The share of infant deaths attributable to biomass fires has increased over time due to the rapid decline in other important causes of infant death. Applying our model estimates across harmonized district-level data covering 98% of global infant deaths, we find that exposure to outdoor biomass burning was associated with nearly 130,000 additional infant deaths per year globally over our 2004 to 2018 study period. Despite the observed decline in biomass burning in Africa, nearly 75% of global infant deaths due to burning still occur in Africa. While fully eliminating biomass burning is unlikely, we estimate that even achievable reductions—equivalent to the lowest observed annual burning in each location during our study period—could have avoided more than 70,000 infant deaths per year globally since 2004. © © 2023 the Author(s).

AB  - Background: Changes in climate and anthropogenic activities have made water salinization a significant threat worldwide, affecting biodiversity, crop productivity and contributing to water insecurity. The Horn of Africa, which includes eastern Ethiopia, northeast Kenya, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Somalia, has natural characteristics that favor high groundwater salinity. Excess salinity has been linked to infrastructure and health problems, including increased infant mortality. This region has suffered successive droughts that have limited the availability of safe drinking water resources, leading to a humanitarian crisis for which little spatially explicit information about groundwater salinity is available. Methods: Machine learning (random forest) is used to make spatial predictions of salinity levels at three electrical conductivity (EC) thresholds using data from 8646 boreholes and wells along with environmental predictor variables. Attention is paid to understanding the input data, balancing classes, performing many iterations, specifying cut-off values, employing spatial cross-validation, and identifying spatial uncertainties. Results: Estimates are made for this transboundary region of the population potentially exposed to hazardous salinity levels. The findings indicate that about 11.6 million people (∼7% of the total population), including 400,000 infants and half a million pregnant women, rely on groundwater for drinking and live in areas of high groundwater salinity (EC > 1500 µS/cm). Somalia is the most affected and has the largest number of people potentially exposed. Around 50% of the Somali population (5 million people) may be exposed to unsafe salinity levels in their drinking water. In only five of Somalia's 18 regions are less than 50% of infants potentially exposed to unsafe salinity levels. The main drivers of high salinity include precipitation, groundwater recharge, evaporation, ocean proximity, and fractured rocks. The combined overall accuracy and area under the curve of multiple runs is ∼ 82%. Conclusions: The modelled groundwater salinity maps for three different salinity thresholds in the Horn of Africa highlight the uneven spatial distribution of salinity in the studied countries and the large area affected, which is mainly arid flat lowlands. The results of this study provide the first detailed mapping of groundwater salinity in the region, providing essential information for water and health scientists along with decision-makers to identify and prioritize areas and populations in need of assistance. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Retention of aging ewes is a strategy producers may use to maintain or increase flock size. Older ewes can have a higher risk of mortality and health issues, but these may be minimised with early intervention and culling. This retrospective study examined the incidence and causes of mortality and culling in a flock of Merino ewes as they aged from 4.5 to 5.5 until 9.5 to 10.5 years. The annual rate of ewe mortality ranged from 6.2% to 9.9%, with lambing complications being the major source of reported loss. Annual culling rates ranged from 1.6% to 42.8%, the larger rates reflecting opportunistic replacement with younger ewes rather than essential culling to maintain welfare and productivity. The major reasons for culling were low condition score, worn or missing teeth or faulty udders. The incidence of other faults was low. Only 18.3% of ewes remained when aged 9.5–10.5 years and these were fertile (89% pregnant) with a high proportion of multiple fetuses (52%) in their final year, although fleece weight had declined. Younger ewes born in 2004/2005 tended to have lower annual mortality rates than the aged ewes, but 8%–12% were still culled annually. It is concluded that an annual inspection pre-joining of all ewes and preventative culling for health issues is necessary to minimise any increase in mortality and risk to ewe welfare from retaining aging ewes. More frequent inspection will be required as potential health issues develop during the year, as these may not be evident pre-joining. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Despite the occurrence of wildfires quadrupling over the past four decades, the health effects associated with wildfire smoke exposures during pregnancy remains unknown. Particulate matter less than 2.5μms (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) is among the major pollutants emitted in wildfire smoke. Previous studies found PM<inf>2.5</inf>associated with lower birthweight, however, the relationship between wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>and birthweight is uncertain. Our study of 7923 singleton births in San Francisco between January 1, 2017 and March 12, 2020 examines associations between wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy and birthweight. We linked daily estimates of wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>to maternal residence at the ZIP code level. We used linear and log-binomial regression to examine the relationship between wildfire smoke exposure by trimester and birthweight and adjusted for gestational age, maternal age, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment. We stratified by infant sex to examine potential effect modification. Exposure to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>during the second trimester of pregnancy was positively associated with increased risk of large for gestational age (OR= 1.13; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.24), as was the number of days of wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>above 5μg m−3in the second trimester (OR= 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.06). We found consistent results with wildfire smoke exposure in the second trimester and increased continuous birthweight-for-gestational agez-score. Differences by infant sex were not consistent. Counter to our hypothesis, results suggest that wildfire smoke exposures are associated with increased risk for higher birthweight. We observed strongest associations during the second trimester. These investigations should be expanded to other populations exposed to wildfire smoke and aim to identify vulnerable communities. Additional research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms in this relationship between wildfire smoke exposure and adverse birth outcomes. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Normal birth is a eustress reaction, a beneficial hedonic stress with extremely high catecholamines that protects us from intrauterine hypoxia and assists in the rapid shift to extrauterine life. Occasionally the cellular O<inf>2</inf> requirement becomes critical and an O<inf>2</inf> deficit in blood (hypoxemia) may evolve to a tissue deficit (hypoxia) and finally a risk of organ damage (asphyxia). An increase in H+ concentration is reflected in a decrease in pH, which together with increased base deficit is a proxy for the level of fetal O<inf>2</inf> deficit. Base deficit (or its negative value, base excess) was introduced to reflect the metabolic component of a low pH and to distinguish from the respiratory cause of a low pH, which is a high CO<inf>2</inf> concentration. Base deficit is a theoretical estimate and not a measured parameter, calculated by the blood gas analyzer from values of pH, the partial pressure of CO<inf>2</inf>, and hemoglobin. Different brands of analyzers use different calculation equations, and base deficit values can thus differ by multiples. This could influence the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis, which is commonly defined as a pH <7.00 combined with a base deficit ≥12.0 mmol/L in umbilical cord arterial blood. Base deficit can be calculated as base deficit in blood (or actual base deficit) or base deficit in extracellular fluid (or standard base deficit). The extracellular fluid compartment represents the blood volume diluted with the interstitial fluid. Base deficit in extracellular fluid is advocated for fetal blood because a high partial pressure of CO<inf>2</inf> (hypercapnia) is common in newborns without concomitant hypoxia, and hypercapnia has a strong influence on the pH value, then termed respiratory acidosis. An increase in partial pressure of CO<inf>2</inf> causes less increase in base deficit in extracellular fluid than in base deficit in blood, thus base deficit in extracellular fluid better represents the metabolic component of acidosis. The different types of base deficit for defining metabolic acidosis in cord blood have unfortunately not been noticed by many obstetrical experts and organizations. In addition to an increase in H+ concentration, the lactate production is accelerated during hypoxia and anaerobic metabolism. There is no global consensus on definitions of normal cord blood gases and lactate, and different cutoff values for abnormality are used. At a pH <7.20, 7% to 9% of newborns are deemed academic; at <7.10, 1% to 3%; and at <7.00, 0.26% to 1.3%. From numerous studies of different eras and sizes, it can firmly be concluded that in the cord artery, the statistically defined lower pH limit (mean -2 standard deviations) is 7.10. Given that the pH for optimal enzyme activity differs between different cell types and organs, it seems difficult to establish a general biologically critical pH limit. The blood gases and lactate in cord blood change with the progression of pregnancy toward a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidemia because of increased metabolism and CO<inf>2</inf> production in the growing fetus. Gestational age-adjusted normal reference values have accordingly been published for pH and lactate, and they associate with Apgar score slightly better than stationary cutoffs, but they are not widely used in clinical practice. On the basis of good-quality data, it is reasonable to set a cord artery lactate cutoff (mean +2 standard deviations) at 10 mmol/L at 39 to 40 weeks’ gestation. For base deficit, it is not possible to establish statistically defined reference values because base deficit is calculated with different equations, and there is no consensus on which to use. Arterial cord blood represents the fetus better than venous blood, and samples from both vessels are needed to validate the arterial origin. A venoarterial pH gradient of <0.02 is commonly used to differentiate arterial from venous samples. Reference values for pH in cord venous blood have been determined, but venous blood comes from the placenta after clearance of a surplus of arterial CO<inf>2</inf>, and base deficit in venous blood then overestimates the metabolic component of fetal acidosis. The ambition to increase neonatal hemoglobin and iron depots by delaying cord clamping after birth results in falsely acidic blood gas and lactate values if the blood sampling is also delayed. Within seconds after birth, sour metabolites accumulated in peripheral tissues and organs will flood into the central circulation and further to the cord arteries when the newborn starts to breathe, move, and cry. This influence of “hidden acidosis” can be avoided by needle puncture of unclamped cord vessels and blood collection immediately after birth. Because of a continuing anaerobic glycolysis in the collected blood, it should be analyzed within 5 minutes to not result in a falsely high lactate value. If the syringe is placed in ice slurry, the time limit is 20 minutes. For pH, it is reasonable to wait no longer than 15 minutes if not in ice. Routine analyses of cord blood gases enable perinatal audits to gain the wisdom of hindsight, to maintain quality assurance at a maternity unit over years by following the rate of neonatal acidosis, to compare results between hospitals on regional or national bases, and to obtain an objective outcome measure in clinical research. Given that the intrapartum cardiotocogram is an uncertain proxy for fetal hypoxia, and there is no strong correlation between pathologic cardiotocograms and fetal acidosis, a cord artery pH may help rather than hurt a staff person subjected to a malpractice suit based on undesirable cardiotocogram patterns. Contrary to common beliefs and assumptions, up to 90% of cases of cerebral palsy do not originate from intrapartum events. Future research will elucidate whether cell injury markers with point-of-care analysis will become valuable in improving the dating of perinatal injuries and differentiating hypoxic from nonhypoxic injuries. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Heat is a dangerous hazard that causes acute heat illness, chronic disease exacerbations, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and a range of injuries. Risks are highest during extreme heat events (EHEs), which challenge the capacity of health systems and other critical infrastructure. EHEs are becoming more frequent and severe, and climate change is driving an increasing proportion of heat-related mortality, necessitating more investment in health protection. Climate-resilient health systems are better positioned for EHEs, and EHE preparedness is a form of disaster risk reduction. Preparedness activities commonly take the form of heat action plans (HAPs), with many examples at various administrative scales. HAP activities can be divided into primary prevention, most important in the pre-event phase; secondary prevention, key to risk reduction early in an EHE;and tertiary prevention, important later in the event phase. After-action reports and other postevent evaluation activities are central to adaptive management of this climate-sensitive hazard. © 2023 Annual Reviews Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The human sex ratio at birth (SRB) is the parameter which reflects the relationship between males and females at birth. It is not 50:50, but approximately 0.515 in favor of males. There are many factors that can influence SRB and its variations are not easily demonstrable. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Our aim was to investigate the environmental and human agents capable of causing variations in the SRB by providing a narrative review of the scientific literature. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Studies demonstrated that male and female embryos/fetuses' response to stress in different way and the male ones show less resistance. This phenomenon seems to persist for approximately six months after a stressful event, suggesting a purpose of reproductive regulation and protection of the perpetuation of the species. Although the relationship of dependence with parenting decisions, thanks to prenatal diagnosis and assisted fertility techniques is easily understood, it is more complex to correlate its variations with environmental pressures that act through secondary mechanisms. The Covid-19 pandemic, natural catastrophes, terroristic attacks, economic crises are some of the difficulties encountered in recent times. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of all the factors reported is not explained only with a possible a priori determination of sex at conception, but also with secondary effects in the pregnancy outcomes. Thus, the determination of sex appears to be a complex and multifactorial mechanism, besides a matter of genetics. The pandemic and climate changes are the present important opportunities of research for possibly reaching more certain answers. © © 2023 Edizioni Minerva Medica.

AB  - Importance Climate change is affecting the earth, resulting in more extreme temperatures and weather, rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and displacement of populations of plants and animals, including people and insects. These changes affect food and housing security, vector-borne illnesses, and access to clean air and water, all of which influence human health. Evidence and Results There are a number of adverse health outcomes linked to heat, air pollution from wildfires, stress from natural disasters, and other elements of climate change. Pregnant people are especially vulnerable to the health harms resulting from climate change, namely, preterm birth, small for gestational age, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and other adverse reproductive health and birth outcomes. Strategies to minimize these harms include mitigation and adaptation. Conclusions and Relevance Physicians are in a unique position to protect the health of pregnant persons and children by advocating for policy changes that address climate change and providing clinical recommendations for patients to protect themselves from the health impacts of climate hazards. Target Audience Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians. Learning objectives After participating in this activity, physicians should be better able to describe the adverse health effects and pregnancy outcomes associated with elements of climate change; and identify strategies for patients to minimize the health harms from climate change, including mitigation, adaptations, and building resilience. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Background: Exposure to wildfire smoke has been linked with a range of health outcomes. However, to date, evidence is limited for the association between wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>, a primary emission of wildfire smoke, and adverse birth outcomes. Objective: We aimed to estimate the risk and burden of preterm birth/term low birth weight, associated with maternal exposure to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Methods: A total of 330,884 birth records with maternal information were collected from the New South Wales Australia from 2015 to 2019, covering 523 residential communities. Daily wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> at a 0.25° × 0.25° (≈ 25 km × 25 km) resolution was estimated by a machine learning method combining 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and reanalysis meteorological data. Cox proportional hazards models were implemented to evaluate the association between wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> and preterm birth/term low birth weight. Number and fraction of preterm birth/term low birth weight attributable to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> during pregnancy were calculated. Results: Per one interquartile-range rise in wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> was found to be associated with 6.9% (HR: 1.069, 95% CI: 1.058–1.081) increased risk of preterm birth and 3.6% (HR: 1.036, 95% CI: 1.014–1.058) higher risk of term low birth weight. The most susceptible gestational window was the 2nd trimester for preterm birth whereas the 1st for term low birth weight. We estimated that 14.30% preterm births and 8.04% term low birth weight cases were attributable to maternal exposure to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> during the whole pregnancy. Male infants and mothers aged ≥ 40, experiencing temperature extremes or living in the inner region, and concepted during spring had higher risks of preterm birth/term low birth weight associated with wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Comparatively, mothers with advanced age have a higher risk of preterm birth while younger mothers were more likely to deliver term newborns with low birth weight, when being exposed to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Pregnancy-induced hypertension enhanced the risk of preterm birth associated with wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Conclusions: This study strengthened robust evidence on the enhanced risk of preterm birth/term low birth weight associated with maternal exposure to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>. In light of higher frequency and intensity of wildfire occurrences globally, more special attention should be paid to pregnant women by policy makers. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Objective To evaluate the potential for adverse health outcomes among infants born to US Coast Guard (USCG) responders to the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill disaster. Methods Department of Defense Birth and Infant Health Research programme data identified a cohort of singleton infants born 2010-2011 to USCG personnel in the DWH Oil Spill Coast Guard Cohort study. Infants were included if their military parent ( € sponsor') responded to the oil spill during a selected reproductive exposure window (ie, 3 months preconception for male sponsors and periconception through pregnancy for female sponsors), or if their sponsor was a non-responder. χ 2 tests and multivariable log-binomial regression were used to compare the demographic and health characteristics of infants born to spill responders and non-responders. Results Overall, 1974 infants with a male sponsor (n=182 responder, n=1792 non-responder) and 628 infants with a female sponsor (n=35 responder, n=593 non-responder) in the DWH Oil Spill Coast Guard Cohort were identified. Health outcomes were similar among the offspring of male responders and non-responders. The frequency of any poor live birth outcome (ie, low birth weight, preterm birth or birth defect) was higher among infants born to female responders (17.1%, n=6) than non-responders (8.9%, n=53); the maternal age-adjusted association was suggestively elevated (risk ratio 1.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 4.16). Conclusion Infant health outcomes were comparable between the offspring of male USCG oil spill responders and non-responders. Findings were limited by the small number of infants identified, particularly among female responders, and should be interpreted with caution. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to examine birth outcomes in areas affected by Hurricane Michael. Methods: Vital statistics data of 2017-2019 were obtained from the state of Florida. Births occurring in the year before and after the date of Hurricane Michael (October 7, 2018) were used. Florida counties were divided into 3 categories reflecting extent of impact from Hurricane Michael. Birth outcomes including incidence of preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and small for gestational age (SGA) were also compared before and after Hurricane Michael. Spontaneous and indicated PTBs were distinguished based on previously published algorithms. Multiple regression was used to control for potential confounders. Results: Both LBW (aRR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.32) and SGA (aRR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.21) were higher in the year after Michael than the year before in the most-affected area; a similar effect was not seen in other areas. A stronger effect was seen for exposure in the first trimester or in the 2 months after Michael than in the second or third trimester. Conclusion: Consistent with many previous studies, this study of Hurricane Michael found an effect on fetal growth. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - In this review, the Basic and Translational Science Assembly of the European Respiratory Society provides an overview of the 2022 International Congress highlights. We discuss the consequences of respiratory events from birth until old age regarding climate change related alterations in air quality due to pollution caused by increased ozone, pollen, wildfires and fuel combustion as well as the increasing presence of microplastic and microfibres. Early life events such as the effect of hyperoxia in the context of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and crucial effects of the intrauterine environment in the context of pre-eclampsia were discussed. The Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) was put forward as a new point of reference for healthy human lungs. The combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial data in the HLCA has enabled the discovery of new cell types/states and niches, and served as a platform that facilitates further investigation of mechanistic perturbations. The role of cell death modalities in regulating the onset and progression of chronic lung diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target was also discussed. Translational studies identified novel therapeutic targets and immunoregulatory mechanisms in asthma. Lastly, it was highlighted that the choice of regenerative therapy depends on disease severity, ranging from transplantation to cell therapies and regenerative pharmacology. © The authors 2023.

AB  - Aim: The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) was a disaster leading to radiation exposure and psychological distress, particularly among pregnant women. However, it is not known how this affected the seasonal changes of pregnancy and childbirth. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of the GEJE in the Fukushima Prefecture on spontaneous and induced abortions with regard to seasonal variability. Methods: We used the data of vital statistics of live birth and stillbirth registry and the census survey of the Fukushima Maternity Care Facility. We calculated the spontaneous and induced abortion rate for 2011–2016 using two different methods (cross-sectional and longitudinal). We calculated the quartiles and outliers to determine the impact and duration of the GEJE. Periodicity was investigated using spectral density analysis. The data were analyzed for the entire Fukushima Prefecture and by region. Results: The spontaneous abortion rate did not show specific changes after the GEJE. Contrarily, the monthly analysis in the cross-sectional method, revealed specific increases in induced abortion rate during the year after the GEJE; in the longitudinal method, induced abortions increased among women who became pregnant within 1 year after the GEJE. Spontaneous abortion showed no specific periodicity, while induced abortion showed cycles of 6 and 12 months, with a particular increase in May each year. Conclusions: The spontaneous abortion rate was not affected by the GEJE. The changes in the induced abortion rate after the disaster may have overlapped with the timing of the increased periodicity, and cannot be attributed solely to the GEJE. © 2023 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

AB  - Background: Injured children initially treated at trauma centers with high emergency department (ED) pediatric readiness have improved survival. Centers with limited resources may not be able to address all pediatric readiness deficiencies, and there currently is no evidence-based guidance for prioritizing different components of readiness. The objective of this study was to identify individual components of ED pediatric readiness associated with better-than-expected survival in US trauma centers to aid in the allocation of resources targeted at improving pediatric readiness. Methods: This cohort study of US trauma centers used the National Trauma Data Bank (2012-2017) matched to the 2013 National Pediatric Readiness Project assessment. Adult and pediatric centers treating at least 50 injured children (younger than 18 years) and recording at least one death during the 6-year study period were included. Using a standardized risk-adjustment model for trauma, we calculated the observed-to-expected mortality ratio for each trauma center. We used bivariate analyses and multivariable linear regression to assess for associations between individual components of ED pediatric readiness and better-than-expected survival. Results: Among 555 trauma centers, the observed-to-expected mortality ratios ranged from 0.07 to 4.17 (interquartile range, 0.93-1.14). Unadjusted analyses of 23 components of ED pediatric readiness showed that trauma centers with better-than-expected survival were more likely to have a validated pediatric triage tool, comprehensive quality improvement processes, a pediatric-specific disaster plan, and critical airway and resuscitation equipment (all p < 0.03). The multivariable analysis demonstrated that trauma centers with both a physician and a nurse pediatric emergency care coordinator had better-than-expected survival, but this association weakened after accounting for trauma center level. Child maltreatment policies were associated with lower-than-expected survival, particularly in Levels III to V trauma centers. Conclusion: Specific components of ED pediatric readiness were associated with pediatric survival among US trauma centers. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Climate change poses one of the greatest risks to human health as air pollution increases, surface temperatures rise, and extreme weather events become more frequent. Environmental exposures related to climate change have a disproportionate effect on pregnant women through influencing food and water security, civil conflicts, extreme weather events, and the spread of disease. Our research team sought to identify the current peer-reviewed research on the effects of climate change-related environmental exposures on perinatal and maternal health in the United States. Design and Methods: A systematic literature review of publications identified through a comprehensive search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases was conducted using a modified Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach. The initial search across both databases identified a combined total of 768 publications. We removed 126 duplicates and 1 quadruplet, and the remaining 639 publications were subjected to our pre-set inclusion and exclusion criteria. We excluded studies outside of the United States. A total of 39 studies met our inclusion criteria and were retained for thematic analysis. Findings: A total of 19 studies investigated the effect of either hot or cold temperature exposure on perinatal and maternal health outcomes. The effect of air pollution on perinatal outcomes was examined in five studies. A total of 19 studies evaluated the association between natural disasters (hurricanes, flash floods, and tropical cyclones) and perinatal and maternal health outcomes. High and low temperature extremes were found to negatively influence neonate and maternal health. Significant associations were found between air pollutant exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were linked to hurricanes, tropical cyclones, and flash floods. Conclusions: This systematic review suggests that climate change-related environmental exposures, including extreme temperatures, air pollution, and natural disasters, are significantly associated with adverse perinatal and maternal health outcomes across the United States. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Over the last 10 decades, the changes in normal environmental conditions, directly or indirectly connected to the presence of several chemical substances released in various ways and means, for many territories, throughout the planet, have become extremely evident, as well as the relative consequences assessed, which involve numerous international working groups. Starting from territorial pollution and known environmental disasters, the World Health Organization, Food and Drug Administration, European Food Safety Authority, European Commission, other international regulatory agencies, scientific societies, and research groups had proposed, through milestone epochs, the methods of study and monitoring of environmentally harmful molecules capable of interfering with the endocrine system, in wildlife, laboratory animals, and humans. Moreover, attention was focused on endocrine functions related to reproductive health and on mechanisms of interaction, during gestation, between fetus, mother, and placenta, in order to bridge the gap of the lack of knowledge in this global theme. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Introduction: When the COVID-19 pandemic disaster hit hospitals, neonates admitted to the NICU were at high risk because they were one of the most vulnerable pediatric patient populations. Although evidence suggests the effects of the SARS-COV2 virus in mild or asymptomatic neonates, the discovery of Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in children represents a unique and severe set of consequences for this disease. Special preparations, management, and strategies are implemented in the context of NICU preparedness in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic based on the adoption of international, national, and local guidelines. Objective: To provide an overview of the NICU strategy or management implemented in the context of NICU preparedness amid the COVID-19 pandemic to assist hospital management and policymakers in service planning and resource allocation. Methods: This systematic review of studies was carried out following the Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the PRISMA reporting item guide. A systematic and comprehensive literature study search was carried out from April 27th, 2022 to May 1st, 2022 on all journal articles published on the National and International Journal Websites Scopus, Proquest, Science Direct, Pubmed, and Google Scholar. Results: 12 articles stated that NICU management preparedness including prenatal care management, intranatal care health protocols, postnatal care, education and protection of health workers, infection prevention education, and parent and family protection. Conclusion: NICU management preparedness is recommended to be applied during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as planning considerations in dealing with similar disasters in the future. © 2023 MPPKI.

AB  - Pregnant people and children are more susceptible to wildfire smoke owing to physiological changes and the rapid growth and development that occur during the critical periods of pregnancy and childhood. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the epidemiological evidence that assesses the associations between wildfire smoke and health outcomes in the perinatal period and childhood. The primary pollutant assessed in this body of research is particulate matter less than 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) from wildfire sources. First, we focus on pregnancy and discuss the unique characteristics of the perinatal period and present a summary of studies of wildfire exposure in pregnancy and effects on maternal and newborn outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm birth, and mental health outcomes. We discuss the various methods used to access exposure and ascertain the outcomes and covariate adjustment in epidemiologic analyses. Second, we focus on exposure to wildfire smoke during childhood and review what is known on the effects of wildfire smoke on child health outcomes including health-service use, respiratory symptoms, and asthma. Our chapter concludes by highlighting the gaps in the literature and directions for future research and policy. This area of study on wildfire exposure and health effects during pregnancy and childhood is in a nascent stage and our knowledge in this is expected to change drastically over the next several years. © 2024 American Geophysical Union.

AB  - Methyl isocyanate (MIC) is a bitter reminder of the Bhopal disaster in 1984. MIC is extremely toxic to humans from acute (short-term) inhalation. It is a colorless liquid with a sharp pungent odor. MIC is prepared industrially by reacting methylamine with phosgene, oxidizing monomethylformamide at high temperatures (>550°C), or heating metal MICs. MIC is also manufactured from N-methylformamide and air. Because of its high reactivity, MIC is used as an intermediate in organic synthesis, most notably in the production of carbamate-based pesticides. Tobacco smoke from some brands of cigarettes also contains MIC, approximately 4μg per cigarette. Most of our knowledge on the toxic effects of MIC on humans is derived from the Union Carbide's battery manufacturing plant explosion accident in Bhopal in 1984. Within days of the initial exposure to MIC, thousands died, and additional deaths occurred during the following years. Exposure to MIC contaminated air can cause extreme irritation in the respiratory system. This can lead to development of pulmonary edema, bronchospasm, or electrolyte imbalance. Temporary reversible blindness may occur depending on the length of exposure. MIC exposed humans may exhibit lung, ocular, and reproductive effects for years; stillbirths and spontaneous abortions have also been observed. EPA has classified methyl isocyanate as a Group D, not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity. © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction. An increase in the number of wildfires, along with the lack of a chemical control system for the quality of the atmosphere during smoke, leads to a risk of developing health disorders for rescuers and firefighters exposed to high concentrations of toxic smoke components. The study aims to identify causal relationships based on experimental modeling between exposure to natural fire smoke and the functional state of the nervous and reproductive systems. Materials and methods. The authors conducted studies on white rats of both sexes. The animals were placed in inhalation chambers and exposed to forest fire smoke of varying concentrations and duration of exposure. The scientists examined the functional state of the nervous system (open field method, Morris test, electroencephalography, histology of nervous tissue), the reproductive system (number of Leydig cells, average number of spermatogonia, spermatogenesis index), the presence of genotoxicity (DNA comet method), DNA methylation and the effect on offspring (postnatal development, species-specific behavior). We calculated the total exposure limit in each group of animals in accordance with the indicators of CO and PM<inf>2.5</inf> content in the chambers. Results. The researchers found that with a total exposure load of 0.03–0.22 mg, there were initial changes in the morphofunctional state of the central nervous system. With an increase in the load to 4 mg, violations of the indicators of behavior and electrical activity of the brain were accompanied by significant changes in the structure of the nervous tissue of the rat brain. The reproductive function of rats under the influence of smoke changed, starting with a total exposure dose of 10.8 mg. We observed a decrease in spermatogenesis and a change in the cyclic function of the ovaries. A violation of the postnatal development of offspring has already been detected with a total dose of 0.22 to 4 mg. Prolonged exposure to tobacco smoke for one month was accompanied by a pronounced violation of the spermatogenetic function of the testicles and an increase in neonatal mortality in offspring, as well as a violation of the structure of behavior and spatial memory in adulthood. The genotoxic effect of smoke was not detected, and a change in DNA methylation in blood cells was detected at the maximum total dose of smoke components. Limitation. The study is limited to studying the effect of wildfire smoke on the nervous and reproductive systems of mongrel white male rats. Conclusion. The results obtained are a fundamental foundation for solving such tasks as the development of risk-oriented preventive health-saving measures for workers in extreme situations in conditions of smoke during wildfires and making effective management decisions. Ethics. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the East-Siberian Institute of Medical and Ecological Research (Protocol LK of East-Siberian Institute of Medical and Ecological Research No. 32/19 dated 09/10/2019), conducted in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrates Used for Experiments or Other Scientific Purposes (ETS No. 123), Directive of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union 2010/63/ EC dated 09/22/2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. © 2023, Izmerov Research Institute of Occupational Medicine.

AB  - Reviewing how much environmental pollution, such as air, soil, and water pollution, which in turn has an effect on the environment, is impacted by oil refineries' hazardous and destructive emissions is the purpose of the current study. Petroleum refineries can be enormous, wide factories with a lot of pipe running throughout, transporting streams of fluids via distillation columns and other chemical processing machinery. One of the major issues with this is the conflict between the economic benefits and the need for refineries throughout the world on the one hand, and environmental concerns on the other. The most frequent gases released into the environment around refineries are, in general, sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Furthermore, heavy metals including cadmium, lead, copper, and zinc are also discharged into the environment along with other compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, toluene, and phenol. In general, Living close a refinery has been demonstrated to have cumulative, long-term health effects due to hazardous fumes, chemical spills, and explosions, according to several studies. Some of the detrimental health effects include an increased risk of developing asthma, malignancies, birth defects, neurological and cardiovascular damage, breathing difficulties, and blood disorders. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna river basin, running through Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and northern India, is home to more than 618 million people. Annual monsoons bring extensive flooding to the basin, with floods predicted to be more frequent and extreme due to climate change. Yet, evidence regarding the long-term impacts of floods on children’s health is lacking. In this analysis, we used high-resolution maps of recent large floods in Bangladesh to identify flood-prone areas over the country. We then used propensity score techniques to identify, among 58, 945 mothers interviewed in six demographic population-based surveys throughout Bangladesh, matched cohorts of exposed and unexposed mothers and leverage data on 150, 081 births to estimate that living in flood-prone areas was associated with an excess risk in infant mortality of 5.3 (95% CI 2.2 to 8.4) additional deaths per 1, 000 births compared to living in non-flood-prone areas over the 30-y period between 1988 and 2017, with higher risk for children born during rainy (7.9, 95% CI: 3.3 to 12.5) vs. dry months (3.1, 95% CI: –1.1 to 7.2). Finally, drawing on national-scale, high-resolution estimates of flood risk and population distribution, we estimated an excess of 152, 753 (64, 120 to 241, 386) infant deaths were attributable to living in flood-prone areas in Bangladesh over the past 30 y, with marked heterogeneity in attributable burden by subdistrict. Our approach demonstrates the importance of measuring longer-term health impacts from floods and provides a generalizable example for how to study climate-related exposures and long-term health effects. © © 2023 the Author(s).

AB  - How has Cuba, a small, developing country, achieved its stunning medical breakthroughs? Hampered by scarce resources and a long-standing U.S. embargo, Cuba nevertheless has managed to provide universal access to health care, comprehensive health education, and advanced technology, even amid desperate economic conditions. Moreover, Cuba has sent disaster relief, donations of medical supplies and technology, and cadres of volunteer doctors throughout the world, emerging, in Castro’s phrase, as a “world medical power.” In her significant and timely study, Julie Feinsilver explores the Cuban medical phenomenon, examining how a governmental obsession with health has reaped medical and political benefits at home and abroad. As a result of Cuba’s forward strides in health care, infant mortality rates are low even by First World standards. Cuba has successfully dealt with the AIDS epidemic in a manner that has aroused controversy and that some claim has infringed on individual liberties-issues that Feinsilver succinctly evaluates. Feinsilver’s research and travel in Cuba over many years give her a unique perspective on the challenges Cuba faces in this time of unprecedented economic and political uncertainty. Her book is a must-read for everyone concerned with health policy, international relations, and Third World societies. © 1993 by The Regents of the University of California.

AB  - Climate change poses an existential threat to children’s health. Divestment of ownership stakes in fossil fuel companies is one tool available to pediatricians to address climate change. Pediatricians are trusted messengers regarding children’s health and therefore bear a unique responsibility to advocate for climate and health policies that affect children. Among the impacts of climate change on pediatric patients are allergic rhinitis and asthma; heat-related illnesses; premature birth; injuries from severe storms and fires; vector-borne diseases; and mental illnesses. Children are disproportionately affected as well by climaterelated displacement of populations, drought, water shortages, and famine. The human-generated burning of fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause global warming. The US healthcare industry is responsible for 8.5% of the nation’s entire greenhouse gases and toxic air pollutants. In this perspectives piece we review the principle of divestment as a strategy for improving childhood health. Healthcare professionals can help combat climate change by embracing divestment in their personal investment portfolios and by their universities, healthcare systems, and professional organizations. We encourage this collaborative organizational effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. © 2023, Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine Inc.. All rights reserved.

VL  - 11
AB  - The link between population dynamics and climate-related severe events is complicated. Extreme weather events (EWEs), along with other factors such as socioeconomic and cultural factors, influence population dynamics, particularly changes in fertility, mortality, and migration. This study focuses solely on the fertility aspect of climate change and aims to investigate it in Bangladesh, which is extremely sensitive to climate change and EWEs such as floods, cyclones, and droughts. On a regular basis, the country is confronted with a number of EWEs. The current study examines how different types of extreme weather events affect vulnerable people’s decisions to have children or to prefer children of a certain gender. People who reside in a particular area may be more vulnerable to particular EWE types, which may result in different preferences for fertility and gender. This study employed individual-level data from three places (flood-prone, drought-prone, and cyclone-prone), each exposed to a distinct hazard, to address this issue, and collected pertinent information from 177 respondents in the susceptible areas using a survey questionnaire. The quantitative results show that the gender of the first child, the perceived risk of infant death due to EWE, the opinion on having more children to recover from the damage and losses caused by EWE, government and non-governmental organization (NGO) support during EWE, and the intended timing of child bearing (after or before EWE) are all significant factors influencing fertility preferences and gender preferences. The findings also indicate that the three regions under investigation have statistically distinct preferences for fertility and gender. There were larger differences between flood-prone areas and drought- and cyclone-prone areas. The complex issue of variations due to different EWEs requires more in-depth studies with larger samples and different methodological techniques. © © 2023 Atiqul Haq.

AB  - Drinking water from various sources in Bangladesh’s coastal region has become polluted with diverse degrees of salinity due to saltwater intrusion from increasing sea levels, cyclone and storm surges, and upstream loss of fresh water. Salinity intrusion poses threats to water standard and security, as well as the health of people. The present study was conducted in coastal Dacope Upazila (sub-district) in southwestern Bangladesh to evaluate the impacts of salinity intrusion on human health. Data on some chronic illnesses such as arsenicosis, diarrhoea, as well as tuberculosis were collected from Dacope Upazila Health Complex for the period of 2013–2019. Environmental parameters comprising total dissolved solids (TDS), total solids (including both dissolved and suspended solids) (TS), acidity-alkalinity (pH), biological oxygen demand (BOD), iron (Fe), chemical oxygen demand (COD), electrical conductivity (EC), salinity, arsenic (As), and groundwater table data were also collected. The study found that within the seven-year period, a total of 843 arsenicosis patients, 31,164 diarrhoea patients, and 20,211 pneumonia or acute respiratory infection patients were treated at the local health complex. Although the study found that there was no significant relationship between the number of patients due to arsenicosis (P = 0.670), diarrhoea (P = 0.316), as well as those with tuberculosis (P = 0.102) and the environmental indicators (including those for salinity), key informants reported that salinity intrusion was associated with adverse maternal health and outcomes (e.g., miscarriage among pregnant women), new born mortality, menstrual hygiene problems, skin diseases, and hypertension among the coastal people. Future research could examine the existence and extent of any such relationship in this region. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Mahbuba Nasreen, Khondoker Mokaddem Hossain and Mohammed Moniruzzaman Khan; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Salinity intrusion in the coastal area of Bangladesh is a potential health risk for exposed populations and factors such as cyclone, tidal surge, flood, river flow, estuarine circulation etc. and climate change can exacerbate this. Salinity mainly affects land and water (surface water and groundwater) in the coastal areas. The aim of the study wastoexploretheimpactofsalinityonhealthinBangladeshbysearchingtheliteraturesystematically. Narrative literature reviews were completed from 27 articles by searching the databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, and grey literature like GoB, ICDDRB, and NGO/INGO during 2000ad to 2018 regarding salinity on health or diseases of Bangladesh. Among them 19 studies (10 studies on pregnant women) are associated with salinity and hypertension or high blood pressure- related diseases that trigger to cardiovascular diseases, morbidity, andmortality.Thisincreasingbloodpressureleadstootherchronicdiseaseslikecardiovasculardiseases, stroke or heart attack, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (after the 20thweek of pregnancy SBP > 140 mmHg or DBP > 90mmHg) of pregnant women, impaired liver function or kidney disease, low platelet count, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm birth, and maternal and prenatal deaths due to drinking water salinity. Five studies are found with cholera diseases in Bangladesh due to salinity intrusion, and three studies are associated with kidney diseases of Bangladeshi or British Bangladeshi patients for higher salt intake and drinking excess brackish water. Higher level of salinity (sodium) was prevalent in young adult, pregnant women, tube wells (ground), and during the dry season than adult or aged, male, pond (surface) and rain water, and the rainy season in this study.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization, midwife-led care is the most appropriate and cost-effective type of perinatal care. As the Covid-19 pandemic with its drastic changes and challenges for the health systems and the medical staff made large adjustments to the healthcare delivery system, midwife-led care became an even more important supportive tool in maintaining unnecessary interventions. This retrospective cohort study aims to compare the outcomes of midwife-led care and team-led care in low-risk births between the Covid-19 pandemic and non-Covid-19 pandemic period. The total studied population was 1,185 singleton births and consisted of 727 births during the non-Covid-19 period and 458 births from the Covid-19 period. The study revealed the safety of low-risk birth care during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in both groups. The maternal and perinatal outcomes remained stable without an increased rate of unsuccessful vaginal births and newborn asphyxia; moreover, birth care of low-risk women provided by midwives preserved autonomy, integrity, and resistance to responding to a disaster. The aforementioned results exhibit that high-quality, safe supervision by midwives in low-risk births can be provided even in high-stress circumstances. © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.

AB  - Extreme heat exposure is associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy and has the potential to impact maternal, neonatal and child health for a lifetime. In an extremely hot climate, pregnant women face an increased risk of premature birth, stillbirth, low birth weight, congenital anomalies and pre-eclampsia. In low and middle-income countries (LMICs), sociodemographic and behavioural practices may negatively affect body hydration during high temperatures. The possible causes and consequences of dehydration in the heat are poorly understood and have been little discussed in the literature. Living in a hot climate poses various challenges, including dehydration, where biological mechanisms and insufficient access to water can lead to dehydration in women and children, with consequences for the health of both mothers and children, particularly in relation to breastfeeding habits. During pregnancy, increased metabolic and cardiovascular demands interact with heat exhaustion and reduced availability of fresh water, which can affect the child’s growth and development. In this opinion piece, we emphasise the possible causes and impacts of dehydration in extreme heat on the health and well-being of mothers and children. We encourage more research, focused on biology and epidemiology, related to raising awareness and implementing adaptations to reduce the risk of dehydration in pregnant, postpartum women and newborns in the context of climate change-related heat exposure. © 2023.

AB  - There were 463,000 head of beef cows in New Mexico as of January 1, 2021 (NASS, 2020), down roughly 4% from 2020 (NASS, 2019). Frequent drought often results in herd reduction and loss of valuable genetic progress. Bull selection is critical due to their influence on herd development. A survey was conducted to identify traits important to bull selection in New Mexico. Surveys were collected digitally (n = 83) and via the mail (n = 74). Responses were largely by cow/calf producers averaging 57 ± 1 years old with 24 ± 1 years' experience. Survey respondents represented 4,384,296 acres of private owned, private leased, and leased public rangeland and irrigated pasture meadow in New Mexico and surrounding states. Average cow/calf operation size was 294 ± 39 head and average bull herd size was 21 ± 3 head. Average price paid for a bull in the past 2 years was $3,981 ± 213. Physical characteristics, individual bull performance information, and genetic information are all important traits to New Mexico bull buyers; however, most producers (56%) indicated that structural soundness was the most important factor influencing their selection decisions. Amongst expected progeny differences (EPDs), New Mexico producers consider the calving ease direct (CED) and birth weight (BW) EPDS to be most important (40% and 35%, respectively). Producers also indicated that multitrait selection indexes used by the American Angus Association were important to their selection decisions, with the beef value ($B) and weaned calf value ($W) indexes being cited most often (35% and 31%, respectively). Elements important to bull purchase include the bull's sale preview (87%), body condition score (86%), feed efficiency/average daily gain information (85%), and actual scrotal circumference (82%). Following purchase of a new bull, most (60%) keep the bull separate from the cow herd until the following breeding season, while the remaining 40% of producers turn newly purchased bulls out within 30 days of purchase. Sixty eight percent of producers evaluate semen quality annually or prior to the start of the breeding season. Interestingly, 39% of producers indicated they used reproductive technologies like artificial insemination and synchronization of estrus while most (80%) test for trichomoniasis. The primary factor influencing culling decisions is age, followed by soundness and fertility. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The results of two previously published reports of the events and impacts of the Campfire wildfire smoke exposure that occurred in California in 2018 are amplified from the point of view of the potential toxic mechanism involved. The Campfire wildfire led to the exposure of a breeding colony of macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during the peak of their breeding season in 2018–2019. Considering the timing, adverse effects, and endocrine implications reported, the cumulative evidence points to an early toxic sensitive period that can lead to birth defects in higher primates and human pregnancies. This deeper inspection of the published observations provides important caveats and useful guidance for future investigators. The unique higher primate placental–adrenal–brain axis may limit the use of many traditional toxicologic approaches. Retrospective neurological evaluations of human fetuses exposed to air pollutants during organogenesis and subsequent retrospective characterization of air samples using in vitro and animal models may be the best procedures to follow. © © 2023 Lasley.

AB  - Wild Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata) were exposed to radiation after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in 2011. To clarify the biological effects of radiation exposure on their fetal growth, pregnant monkeys and their fetuses were analyzed. These animals were collected between 2008 and 2020 (before and after the accident in 2011) living in Fukushima City, approximately 70 km from the nuclear power plant. Multiple regression analyses were conducted with fetal body weight (FBW) and fetal head circumference (FHS) as objective variables, and maternal and fetal factors as explanatory variables. The maternal factors were relative exposure dose rate (REDR), age, body weight, body length, fat index, and parity. The fetal factors were crown ramp length (CRL) and sex. Multiple regression analyses showed that FBR and FHS growth were positively associated with CRL, maternal body length, and negatively associated with REDR. Since the relative growth of FBR and FHS to CRL decreased with increasing REDR, radiation exposure due to the nuclear accident may have contributed to the delayed fetal growth observed in Japanese monkeys. © © 2023 Hayama, Nakanishi, Tanaka, Konno, Kawamoto and Omi.

AB  - We study the impacts of in utero exposure to Hurricane Catarina of March 2004, the first hurricane to hit Brazil. Catarina was unexpected and is representative of other recent hurricanes in the Americas in terms of wind speed, direct economic costs, and population affected. We use a tripledifferences strategy (close vs. far municipality, 2004 vs. 2003, after March vs. before) to highlight the importance of flexibly accounting for season of birth effects. We find that the adverse effects of exposure are concentrated among babies born to mothers 15–24 years old: birth weight decreased by 82 g, the probability of being born with low birth weight increased by 3.4 percentage points, and fetal deaths increased by about 17 per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths. Reductions in employment or healthcare use do not explain these impacts. Maternal stress is a plausible mechanism if younger women are more financially vulnerable to negative shocks, consistent with recent work highlighting the relationship between socioeconomic status, stress, and birth outcomes. Our findings are robust to various checks, including testing for pre-trends in infant health outcomes © 2023 by the Board of Regents of the University ofWisconsin System

AB  - Aim: SARS-CoV2 is the latest pandemic that have plagued the socio-health system as an epiphenomenon resulting from planetary resources abuse, crucial for biodiversity. The Anthropocene best defines the present epoch in which human activity irreversibly manipulates intricate and delicate geological and biological balances established over eons. The devastating ecological and socio-economic implications of COVID-19, underline the importance of updating the present pandemic framework to a syndemic. This paper stems from the need to suggest to scientists, doctors, and patients a mission that integrates responsibility from individual to collective health, from present to trans-generational, from human to the entire biotic network. Today's choices are crucial for the perspective on all levels: political, economic, and health as well as cultural. Methods: Research on PubMed and other specific web-sites journal was performed on the topic “Microbiota”, “Covid-19”, “Pandemic”, “Zoonosis”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “Environmental Pollutants”, “Epigenetics”, “Fetal Programming”, “Human Extinction”. Data collected were analysed for an integrative model of interconnection between environment, pregnancy, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and microbiota. Moreover, systematic literature review allowed to summarise in a table information about the worst pandemics that afflicted the human species recently. Results: This paper offers a broad view of the current pandemic starting with pregnancy, the moment when a new life begins and the health trajectories of the unborn child are defined, which will inevitably have repercussions on his well-being. The fundamental role of the biodiversity-rich microbiota in avoiding the development of severe infectious diseases, is therefore highlighted. It is imperative to adjust the current reductionist paradigm based on mostly immediate symptom management towards a broader understanding of the spatial interconnection of ecological niches with human health and the impacts of today's choices on the future. Health and healthcare are elitist rather than egalitarian, therefore focusing on environmental health forces us to make a concerted and systemic effort that challenges political and economic barriers, which are biologically senseless. A healthy microbiota is essential to well-being, both by preventing chronic degenerative conditions, the infectiousness and pathogenicity of bacterial and viral diseases. SARS-CoV-2 should not be an exception. The human microbiota, forged by the first 1,000 days of life, is fundamental in shaping the health-disease trajectories, and by the everlasting exposome that is dramatically affected by the ecological disaster. Individual health is one world health whereas single and global well-being are interdependent in a space-time perspective. Conclusions: Is it not a convenient reductionism not to consider the COVID-19 emergency as a bio-social epiphenomenon of a far more devastating and multi-faceted crisis whose common denominator is the global biotic network loss of which humans are still part?. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Plastics have conveyed great benefits to humanity and made possible some of the most significant advances of modern civilization in fields as diverse as medicine, electronics, aerospace, construction, food packaging, and sports. It is now clear, however, that plastics are also responsible for significant harms to human health, the economy, and the earth's environment. These harms occur at every stage of the plastic life cycle, from extraction of the coal, oil, and gas that are its main feedstocks through to ultimate disposal into the environment. The extent of these harms not been systematically assessed, their magnitude not fully quantified, and their economic costs not comprehensively counted. Goals: The goals of this Minderoo-Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health are to comprehensively examine plastics' impacts across their life cycle on: (1) human health and well-being; (2) the global environment, especially the ocean; (3) the economy; and (4) vulnerable populations-the poor, minorities, and the world's children. On the basis of this examination, the Commission offers science-based recommendations designed to support development of a Global Plastics Treaty, protect human health, and save lives. Report structure: This Commission report contains seven Sections. Following an Introduction, Section 2 presents a narrative review of the processes involved in plastic production, use, and disposal and notes the hazards to human health and the environment associated with each of these stages. Section 3 describes plastics' impacts on the ocean and notes the potential for plastic in the ocean to enter the marine food web and result in human exposure. Section 4 details plastics' impacts on human health. Section 5 presents a first-order estimate of plastics' health-related economic costs. Section 6 examines the intersection between plastic, social inequity, and environmental injustice. Section 7 presents the Commission's findings and recommendations. Plastics: Plastics are complex, highly heterogeneous, synthetic chemical materials. Over 98% of plastics are produced from fossil carbon- coal, oil and gas. Plastics are comprised of a carbon-based polymer backbone and thousands of additional chemicals that are incorporated into polymers to convey specific properties such as color, flexibility, stability, water repellence, flame retardation, and ultraviolet resistance. Many of these added chemicals are highly toxic. They include carcinogens, neurotoxicants and endocrine disruptors such as phthalates, bisphenols, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), brominated flame retardants, and organophosphate flame retardants. They are integral components of plastic and are responsible for many of plastics' harms to human health and the environment.Global plastic production has increased almost exponentially since World War II, and in this time more than 8,300 megatons (Mt) of plastic have been manufactured. Annual production volume has grown from under 2 Mt in 1950 to 460 Mt in 2019, a 230-fold increase, and is on track to triple by 2060. More than half of all plastic ever made has been produced since 2002. Single-use plastics account for 35-40% of current plastic production and represent the most rapidly growing segment of plastic manufacture. Explosive recent growth in plastics production reflects a deliberate pivot by the integrated multinational fossil-carbon corporations that produce coal, oil and gas and that also manufacture plastics. These corporations are reducing their production of fossil fuels and increasing plastics manufacture. The two principal factors responsible for this pivot are decreasing global demand for carbon-based fuels due to increases in 'green' energy, and massive expansion of oil and gas production due to fracking. Plastic manufacture is energy-intensive and contributes significantly to climate change. At present, plastic production is responsible for an estimated 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the contribution of Brazil. This fraction is projected to increase to 4.5% by 2060 if current trends continue unchecked. Plastic life cycle: The plastic life cycle has three phases: production, use, and disposal. In production, carbon feedstocks-coal, gas, and oil-are transformed through energy-intensive, catalytic processes into a vast array of products. Plastic use occurs in every aspect of modern life and results in widespread human exposure to the chemicals contained in plastic. Single-use plastics constitute the largest portion of current use, followed by synthetic fibers and construction. Plastic disposal is highly inefficient, with recovery and recycling rates below 10% globally. The result is that an estimated 22 Mt of plastic waste enters the environment each year, much of it single-use plastic and are added to the more than 6 gigatons of plastic waste that have accumulated since 1950. Strategies for disposal of plastic waste include controlled and uncontrolled landfilling, open burning, thermal conversion, and export. Vast quantities of plastic waste are exported each year from high-income to low-income countries, where it accumulates in landfills, pollutes air and water, degrades vital ecosystems, befouls beaches and estuaries, and harms human health-environmental injustice on a global scale. Plastic-laden e-waste is particularly problematic. Environmental findings: Plastics and plastic-associated chemicals are responsible for widespread pollution. They contaminate aquatic (marine and freshwater), terrestrial, and atmospheric environments globally. The ocean is the ultimate destination for much plastic, and plastics are found throughout the ocean, including coastal regions, the sea surface, the deep sea, and polar sea ice. Many plastics appear to resist breakdown in the ocean and could persist in the global environment for decades. Macro- and micro-plastic particles have been identified in hundreds of marine species in all major taxa, including species consumed by humans. Trophic transfer of microplastic particles and the chemicals within them has been demonstrated. Although microplastic particles themselves (>10 µm) appear not to undergo biomagnification, hydrophobic plastic-associated chemicals bioaccumulate in marine animals and biomagnify in marine food webs. The amounts and fates of smaller microplastic and nanoplastic particles (MNPs <10 µm) in aquatic environments are poorly understood, but the potential for harm is worrying given their mobility in biological systems. Adverse environmental impacts of plastic pollution occur at multiple levels from molecular and biochemical to population and ecosystem. MNP contamination of seafood results in direct, though not well quantified, human exposure to plastics and plastic-associated chemicals. Marine plastic pollution endangers the ocean ecosystems upon which all humanity depends for food, oxygen, livelihood, and well-being. Human health findings: Coal miners, oil workers and gas field workers who extract fossil carbon feedstocks for plastic production suffer increased mortality from traumatic injury, coal workers' pneumoconiosis, silicosis, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Plastic production workers are at increased risk of leukemia, lymphoma, hepatic angiosarcoma, brain cancer, breast cancer, mesothelioma, neurotoxic injury, and decreased fertility. Workers producing plastic textiles die of bladder cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma, and interstitial lung disease at increased rates. Plastic recycling workers have increased rates of cardiovascular disease, toxic metal poisoning, neuropathy, and lung cancer. Residents of "fenceline" communities adjacent to plastic production and waste disposal sites experience increased risks of premature birth, low birth weight, asthma, childhood leukemia, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. During use and also in disposal, plastics release toxic chemicals including additives and residual monomers into the environment and into people. National biomonitoring surveys in the USA document population-wide exposures to these chemicals. Plastic additives disrupt endocrine function and increase risk for premature births, neurodevelopmental disorders, male reproductive birth defects, infertility, obesity, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and cancers. Chemical-laden MNPs formed through the environmental degradation of plastic waste can enter living organisms, including humans. Emerging, albeit still incomplete evidence indicates that MNPs may cause toxicity due to their physical and toxicological effects as well as by acting as vectors that transport toxic chemicals and bacterial pathogens into tissues and cells.Infants in the womb and young children are two populations at particularly high risk of plastic-related health effects. Because of the exquisite sensitivity of early development to hazardous chemicals and children's unique patterns of exposure, plastic-associated exposures are linked to increased risks of prematurity, stillbirth, low birth weight, birth defects of the reproductive organs, neurodevelopmental impairment, impaired lung growth, and childhood cancer. Early-life exposures to plastic-associated chemicals also increase the risk of multiple non-communicable diseases later in life. Economic findings: Plastic's harms to human health result in significant economic costs. We estimate that in 2015 the health-related costs of plastic production exceeded $250 billion (2015 Int$) globally, and that in the USA alone the health costs of disease and disability caused by the plastic-associated chemicals PBDE, BPA and DEHP exceeded $920 billion (2015 Int$). Plastic production results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions equivalent to 1.96 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>e) annually. Using the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) social cost of carbon metric, we estimate the annual costs of these GHG emissions to be $341 billion (2015 Int$).These costs, large as they are, almost certainly underestimate the full economic losses resulting from plastics' negative impacts on human health and the global environment. All of plastics' economic costs-and also its social costs-are externalized by the petrochemical and plastic manufacturing industry and are borne by citizens, taxpayers, and governments in countries around the world without compensation. Social justice findings: The adverse effects of plastics and plastic pollution on human health, the economy and the environment are not evenly distributed. They disproportionately affect poor, disempowered, and marginalized populations such as workers, racial and ethnic minorities, "fenceline" communities, Indigenous groups, women, and children, all of whom had little to do with creating the current plastics crisis and lack the political influence or the resources to address it. Plastics' harmful impacts across its life cycle are most keenly felt in the Global South, in small island states, and in disenfranchised areas in the Global North. Social and environmental justice (SEJ) principles require reversal of these inequitable burdens to ensure that no group bears a disproportionate share of plastics' negative impacts and that those who benefit economically from plastic bear their fair share of its currently externalized costs. Conclusions: It is now clear that current patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal are not sustainable and are responsible for significant harms to human health, the environment, and the economy as well as for deep societal injustices.The main driver of these worsening harms is an almost exponential and still accelerating increase in global plastic production. Plastics' harms are further magnified by low rates of recovery and recycling and by the long persistence of plastic waste in the environment. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The present study analyzed the relation of disaster exposure prior to pregnancy with maternal characteristics and obstetric outcomes. Methods: The participants were 13,148 pregnant women recruited from 2013 to 2017. The women were classified into three groups by the severity of housing damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011: group A, house was not destroyed/did not live in the disaster area; group B, half/part of the house was destroyed; and group C, house was totally/ mostly destroyed. Maternal characteristics, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and gestational weeks were obtained using questionnaires and medical records. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the relation between disaster exposure and maternal characteristics, HDP, and GDM. A structural equation model was applied to investigate the relation of disaster exposure with HDP and gestational weeks. Results: The homes of about 11% of the women were totally/mostly destroyed. For groups B and C compared with those in group A, the adjusted ORs for HDP were 1.04 and 1.26 (P for trend = 0.01), and for GDM were 0.89 and 1.14 (P for trend = 0.9), respectively. Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) mediated 23.2% of the relation between disaster exposure and HDP. Disaster exposure was associated with gestational weeks. Conclusion: Disaster exposure at least 2.5 years before pregnancy was found to be associated with maternal characteristics and the prevalence of HDP. Pre-pregnancy BMI mediated the relation between disaster exposure and the prevalence of HDP, and gestational weeks were reduced through HDP. © 2021 Mami Ishikuro et al.

AB  - Objectives: During natural disasters, pregnant women are at risk of experiencing stress related pregnancy complications. This study explores factors influencing perceived stress reported by 90 women surveyed about their pregnancy during cyclones in Queensland, Australia. Methods: Perceived stress was measured using the 10 item Perceived Stress Scale and objective hardship using the Traumatic Stress Schedule. Maternal characteristics were captured using validated questions pilot tested for reliability and validity. Hierarchical linear regression was used to test factors across three analysis blocks (maternal sociodemographic characteristics, mediating factors, and objective hardship). The effect of factor interactions was tested both within and between analysis blocks. Results: Separate factors were found to have no significant effect on perceived stress. However, a significant moderating effect was found between maternal country of birth and experiences of objective hardship. Perceived stress levels were higher for mothers born in New Zealand who also experienced cyclone stressors (β = 0.48, p = 0.014), and mothers born in the United Kingdom/Western Europe who experienced non-cyclone stressors (β = 0.44, p = 0.014) and pregnancy complications (β = 0.43, p = 0.011). Conclusion: Recall and sampling bias may influence perceived stress reported. However, mothers migrating to a different country are at a higher risk of experiencing disaster stressors. This can be due to limited social networks and access to resources. Identifying additional vulnerabilities within an existing disaster priority group supports informed risk mitigation. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - In disaster situations, cholera outbreaks represent a public health emergency due to their high fatality rates and high spreading risk through camps for refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). The aim of this study is to examine water, sanitation, and hygiene attitudes and cholera knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among people living in resettlement sites in Cabo Delgado, the northernmost province of Mozambique. Between January 1 and March 31, 2022, a cross-sectional survey was conducted by administering a face-to-face interview to IDPs and residents in six relocation sites in Cabo Delgado Province. A total of 440 people were enrolled in the study. Overall, 77.8% (N 5 342) were female, 61% (N 5 268) were younger than 35 years old, and 60.5% (N 5 266) reported primary school to be the highest education level. Seventy-five percent (N 5 334) of participants lived with children under 5 years old. Thirty-one percent (N 5 140) and 11.8% (N 5 52) of the respondents reported, respectively, at least one cholera case and at least one diarrheal-related death among their family members in the previous 2 years. In multivariate analysis, being female, being younger than 35 years old, having attained a higher education level, owning a phone, or having soap at home were factors significantly associated with improved cholera KAP. In severely deconstructed social contexts, continuous education and community sensitization are crucial to achieve and maintain positive cholera prevention attitudes. © 2023 American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB  - Almost one-fourth of the global population live in South Asia (SA) countries with 14% of cultivable land. Most of the countries in the South Asian region are facing multiple challenges like high population growth, declining farm land area, and low productivity in primary and secondary sectors leading to limited employment opportunities. Consequently, both availability and access to food are adversely affected. Regions exposed to natural disasters, tribal and the hilly regions of SA are amongst the most vulnerable in terms of food security. Accelerated efforts are required to ensure that conflicts do not exacerbate the already fragile food situation in SA. Despite recent strong gains in economic growth and agricultural productivity, food and nutritional security remains a major concern in SA. The region has the largest concentration of poverty and hunger in the world, with nearly 40% of the world's impoverished and 45% of the world's undernourished people. The enormity of malnutrition in SA can be gauged from the fact that it is the home to nearly two-thirds of the world's undernourished children. More than 56% of the world's low-birth-weight babies are born in SA. Furthermore, food and nutrition security remain major challenges with a large proportion of the world's poor living here and global hunger index (GHI) at 30.9. Overcoming these twin challenges require actions both at the national and regional level. Among production constraints and yield gaps, imbalanced nutrient use is a critical issue in many of the SA countries, with nutrient application focused mainly on nitrogen (N), leaving the possibility for other plant nutrient deficiencies including phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). In some cases, the use efficiency of N may be low due to losses in the form of N<inf>2</inf>O emissions, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG), or via leaching with the undesirable offsite effects. Among the primary nutrients, K is an essential nutrient for productivity, food quality and numerous functions in the plant system. It plays a major role in activating ∼60 enzymes, regulating stomatal functions, controlling water relations especially under rainfed crop production, influencing the water balance of plant systems, and underpinning agronomic productivity and sustainability. Negative K balance in soil under intensive cropping is reported because of low external input and large crop removal, leading to large scale K mining in soils. Declining yield trends were observed in several fertilizer experiments 30–40 years long with continuous application of either N alone or NP without K under both irrigated and rainfed crop production systems in the region. Recent K fertility analysis indicates widespread K deficiency in light-textured alluvial soils, red and lateritic soils beside acid soil types in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan. The countries in SA depend largely on imported K fertilizers. Such imported fertilizer should be utilized most efficiently in the light of limited global K mineral reserves and 93% of world total K exports are from five countries viz. Canada (37.12%) followed by the Russian Federation, Belarus, Germany and Israel. Therefore, the current review addresses issues related to the K supplying capacity of soils in various crop production systems in SA, crop K responses, soil test methods followed, emerging issues in soil K fertility, K balance in major cropping systems and rationalizing K recommendations among crops, soil types and agro-ecological regions. The role of K in balanced nutrition, farm productivity, food and nutritional security in these countries is examined. The review also covers the critical role of K in climate change adaptation, mitigation of nitrous oxide (N<inf>2</inf>O) emissions and improving overall nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in the SA region. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives: A male is less adaptable to biological stressors than a female fetus with consequent higher morbidity and mortality. Adverse birth outcomes increase and male livebirths decrease after environmental disasters, economic crises, and terrorist events. We hypothesized the ratio of male to female livebirths would decrease in areas affected by severe tropical cyclones (TCs) in Queensland, Australia. Additionally, in male livebirths, there would be an increase in preterm and low birthweight births. Lastly, we hypothesized that the pregnancy stage at which exposure occurred would modify the association between TC exposure and observed outcomes. Methods: Interrupted time series analysis was used to analyze Queensland administrative birth records from July 2007 to June 2018 for significant changes in the sex ratio at birth, measured as the proportion of male livebirths. Adjusted generalized linear models were fitted to births in areas affected by two category five TCs: cyclones Yasi (February 2011) and Marcia (February 2015). To explore male mortality and morbidity risk, additional analysis was conducted on the proportion of male stillborn, low birthweight, and preterm births. The association between estimated pregnancy stage during the TC and the proportion of male births was also analyzed. Results: Contrary to our hypothesis, increases in the proportion of male livebirths were observed following early-pregnancy exposure to cyclone Yasi and mid-pregnancy exposure to Marcia, although the latter was not statistically significant. No significant changes were observed in proportions of male stillborn, low birthweight, and preterm births. Conclusions: This study found a significant association between severe TCs and sex ratio at birth. The stage of pregnancy at which maternal stressors were experienced modified this association. Among people exposed in early to mid-pregnancy, the proportion of male births was higher. This may be because of differential loss of females in utero. Studying sex differences in birth outcomes provides insight into in utero vulnerabilities associated with environmental stressors. Climate change is increasing the intensity and frequency of natural disasters. Understanding fetal vulnerability to environmental stressors will provide crucial information supporting early life health interventions that mitigate the immediate and long-term effects. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: We evaluated the effectiveness of transarterial embolization (TAE) for intractable postpartum hemorrhage in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) despite emergency hysterectomy. Materials and methods: We retrospectively assessed TAE performed after emergency hysterectomy in 15 patients between July 2008 and January 2022. Underlying condition, technical success, clinical success, angiographic findings, laboratory findings, pregnancy-modified DIC score (The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis), blood transfusion, ICU (Intensive care unit) admission day, hospital day, in-hospital mortality, and long-term sequelae were evaluated. Results: All patients were diagnosed with DIC before embolization, with a 43.9 mean DIC score. All patients showed positive angiographic findings for active bleeding. Thirty-eight bleeding arteries were confirmed. The remnant uterine artery (n=25) was the most common focus of persistent bleeding, followed by the cervicovaginal artery (n=6), pudendal artery (n=3), obturator artery (n=2), vesical artery (n=1), and unspecified artery from the internal iliac artery (n=1). Technical and clinical success rates were 100% (15/15) and 93.3% (14/15), respectively. Mean nadir hemoglobin (Hb) level before embolization was 4.9 g/dL. All patients underwent massive transfusion before embolization (mean 33.2 packs of RBC). Postoperatively, a smaller amount of blood was transfused than before the procedure (mean 10.6 packs of RBC). Mean nadir Hb level after embolization was 8.2 g/dL. There was one instance each of in-hospital death, hypoxic brain damage, and ischemic acute kidney injury. Conclusion: Despite hysterectomy for postpartum bleeding, there could be multiple residual or uncontrolled bleeding foci, especially in case of DIC, for which TAE could be an effective treatment. © 2022 The Royal College of Radiologists

AB  - Climate change has increased the frequency of drought occurrence in various parts of the world. Drought as a complex phenomenon causes severe impacts on ecological and socio-economic status. Short-term and long-term occurrences of drought have made many regions vulnerable globally. This paper makes an attempt to assess drought vulnerability in Godavari Middle Sub-basin of India. Twenty-four site specific socio-economic and environmental factors were identified based on the extensive literature review. Drought frequency was assessed using standardized precipitation index (SPI). These datasets were divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) data. Frequency ratio (FR) model was utilized to establish relationship among drought conditioning factors and drought frequency. Weights obtained from the FR model were used as input to the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) model. Drought vulnerability results were validated using the testing data and receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The accuracy of ANFIS models for 1-month (0.957), 3-months (0.882), 6-months (0.964) and 12-months (0.938) showed high suitability of ANFIS model for the assessment of drought vulnerability. The findings revealed that very low normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and increasing trend of highest maximum and mean maximum temperature were major environmental factors which influenced high drought vulnerability in the sub-basin. High proportion of area under fallow land, high infant mortality rate (IMR) and moderate literacy rate were identified as major socio-economic factors making watersheds vulnerable during short and long-term droughts. Largest area of the sub-basin was found under high vulnerability for 3-months, followed by 6-months and 12-months droughts. Thus, the study calls for policy intervention towards lessening the impact of drought in highly vulnerable watersheds. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objective: Ionizing radiation is a human carcinogen, and there is evidence that exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes. Methods: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the research of maternal and paternal exposure to low-dose radiation on low birth weight, miscarriage, pre-term delivery, and stillbirth. Our literature search used four databases (PubMed, Environmental Index, GeoBASE, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature). We included study populations exposed to occupational and medical sources of radiation, nuclear disasters, and those living near nuclear power plants. We considered papers published between January 1st, 1990, and June 30th, 2021. The quality of the studies was assessed, and we performed meta-analysis using random effects models to generate summary measures of association. Forest plots were created to assess the heterogeneity in these measures, and funnel plots were used to assess publication bias. Results: Overall, 26 studies were identified, and these yielded measures of association from 10, 11, and 8 studies for low birth weight, miscarriage, and stillbirth outcomes, respectively. It was not possible to perform meta-analyses for pre-term delivery due to a small number of studies. The meta-analysis summary relative risk (RR) of having a low-birth-weight infant among those ever exposed to radiation relative to those unexposed, after adjusting for publication bias, was 1.29 (95% CI 0.97–1.73). The corresponding risk estimates for miscarriage and stillbirth were 1.15 (95% CI 1.02–1.30), and 1.19 (95% CI 0.98–1.45), respectively. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that ionizing radiation increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes. Future work should strive to provide data needed to better understand the shape of the exposure–response curve. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives Previous research has suggested that women firefighters may have a greater risk of adverse reproductive outcomes compared with non-firefighting women. In this study, we investigated the association between firefighter occupational factors and risk of preterm birth. Methods This cross-sectional analysis of US firefighters surveyed in 2017 compared preterm birth among firefighters to non-firefighters using age-at-pregnancy-standardised prevalence ratios. Generalised estimating equations estimated relative risks and 95% CIs between firefighter occupational factors (career or volunteer, wildland status, shift schedule, fire responses, work restriction) and preterm birth risk. We adjusted for age-at-pregnancy, education, gravidity, BMI, and smoking and considered effect modification by age-at-pregnancy and career versus volunteer status. Results Among 934 women who reported 1356 live births, 12% were preterm (n=161). Preterm birth prevalence among firefighters was 1.41 times greater than non-firefighters (95% CI 1.18 to 1.68). Among wildland and combination wildland/structural firefighters, volunteers had 2.82 times the risk of preterm birth (95% CI 1.19 to 6.67) compared with career firefighters. Firefighters who started restricting their work in the 2nd trimester had a nonsignificant 0.67 times lower risk of preterm birth than those who started in the 3rd trimester or did not restrict work at all (95% CI 0.43 to 1.03). Conclusions Firefighters may have greater risk of preterm birth than non-firefighters, which could be influenced by roles in the fire service and work restrictions taken. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

AB  - Introduction: Hurricanes Irma and Maria made landfall in the US Virgin Islands (USVI) in 2017. To date, there is no published literature available on the experiences of pregnant women in the USVI exposed to these hurricanes. Understanding how hurricanes affect pregnant women is key to developing and executing targeted hurricane preparedness and response policies. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of pregnancy and birth among women in the USVI exposed to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Methods: We employed a qualitative descriptive methodology to guide sampling, data collection, and analysis. Semi-structured interviews of 30–60 min in length were conducted with a purposive sample of women (N = 18) in the USVI who were pregnant during or became pregnant within two months after the hurricanes. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and data managed in MAXQDA. Team members developed a codebook, applied codes for content, and reconciled discrepancies. We thematically categorized text according to a socioecological conceptual framework of risk and resilience for maternal-neonatal health following hurricane exposure. Results: Women’s experiences were organized into two main categories (risk and resilience). We identified the following themes related to risk at 3 socioecological levels including: (1) individual: changes in food access (We had to go without) and stress (I was supposed to be relaxing); (2) household/community: diminished psychosocial support (Everyone was dealing with their own things) and the presence of physical/environmental hazards (I was really scared); and (3) maternity system: compromised care capacity (The hospital was condemned). The themes related to resilience included: (1) individual: personal coping strategies (Being calm); (2) household/community: mutual psychosocial and tangible support (We shared our resources); and (3) the maternity system: continuity of high-quality care (On top of their game). Conclusions: A socioecological approach provides a useful framework to understand how risk and resilience influence the experience of maternal hurricane exposure. As the frequency of the most intense hurricanes is expected to increase, clinicians, governments, and health systems should work collaboratively to implement hurricane preparedness and response plans that address pregnant women’s unique needs and promote optimal maternal-infant health. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Studies of effects of hurricanes on perinatal outcomes often rely on approximate measures of exposure. This study aims to use observed damage from aerial imagery to refine residential building damage estimates, evaluate the population changes post landfall, and assess the associations between the extent of residential building damage and adverse perinatal outcomes and access to prenatal care (PNC) services. Methods: Vital statistics data from the Florida Department of Health’s Office of Vital Statistics were used to align maternal geocoded address data to high-resolution imagery (0.5-foot resolution, true color with red, blue, and green bands) aerial photographs. Machine learning (support vector machines) classified residential roof damage across the study area. Perinatal outcomes were compared with the presence or absence of damage to the mother’s home. Log-binomial regression models were used to compare the populations living in and outside of high-risk/damage areas, to assess the population changes after Hurricane Michael, and to estimate the associations between damage after Hurricane Michael and adverse perinatal outcomes/access to PNC services. A semi-parametric linear model was used to model time of first PNC visit and increase in damage. Results: We included 8,965 women in analysis. Women with lower education and/or of Black or other non-White race/ethnicity were more likely to live in areas that would see high damage than other groups. Moreover, there was a greater proportion of births delivered by women living in the high-risk/damage area (> 25% damaged parcels after Michael) in the year before Michael than the year after Michael. Lastly, living in the area with relatively high damage increased the risk of having intermediate or inadequate PNC (adjusted Risk Ratio = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.43), but not other adverse perinatal outcomes. Conclusions: Aerially observed damage data enable us to evaluate the impact of natural disasters on perinatal outcomes and access to PNC services based on residential building damage immediately surrounding a household. The association between the extent of damage and adverse perinatal outcomes should be further investigated in future studies. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Early forecasts give people in a storm’s path time to prepare. Less is known about the cost to society when forecasts are incorrect. In this observational study, we examine over 700,000 births in the path of Hurricane Irene and find exposure was associated with impaired birth outcomes. Additional warning time was associated with decreased preterm birth rates for women who experienced intense storm exposures documenting a benefit of avoiding a type II forecasting error. A larger share of this at-risk population experienced a type I forecasting error where severe physical storm impacts were anticipated but not experienced. Disaster anticipation disrupted healthcare services by delaying and canceling prenatal care, which may contribute to storm-impacted birth outcomes. Recognizing storm damages depend on human responses to predicted storm paths is critical to supporting the next generation’s developmental potential with judicious forecasts that ensure public warning systems mitigate rather than exacerbate climate damages. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: Flood is an annual phenomenon in Assam. This study aims to understand the after flood effects on children in the worst flood-hit districts of Assam during the last decades most devastating flood where more than 1,00,000 people were affected. Study design: A cross sectional population-based study was done covering 7512 children of 0–12 years of age in 35 worse flood-affected villages in three districts of lower Assam for nutritional risk profiling, low birth weight and morbidity pattern. Method: Anthropometric measurements of the children were compared with standard WHO definitions for nutritional risk profiling. ANOVA was conducted to see any relationship of nutritional status between the age groups and BMI for the districts. Two-factor ANOVA to analyse the effect of ARI on the morbidity status of different districts was done. District-wise and village-wise heat maps were generated to understand different nutritional parameters for analysing which areas within each district are more affected and why. Results: The moderate (< 2SD) and severely underweight (< 3SD) children under 5 years of age were highest in the Barpeta district (45.5% and 24.2% respectively). The moderate and severe stunting was highest in Morigaon (47.6%) and Barpeta (24.3%) respectively. The moderate and severe wasting was highest in the Morigaon district (46.1% and 20.6% respectively). All the nutritional indicators were less than the WHO standard. The age-wise and district-wise distribution of nutritional status shows variations in all three districts. Severe underweight was observed highest among 24–35 months’ children (50.9%) in Barpeta. The moderate and severe undernutrition status was found to be higher among the age group of 10–12 years of age compared to 5 to 10 years. Conclusion: This survey has provided a comprehensive picture of the nutritional status of the targeted children in the worst flood-affected areas. However, attention to its impact on health particularly among those exposed at very early stages in life is still lacking. This kind of rapid assessment helps to understand the health and nutritional status of the vulnerable groups in a deeper way and to plan robust region-specific interventions. © 2022, Indian National Science Academy.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the relation between early exposure to stressful events and symptoms of the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children, based on the outcomes from a natural experiment. It was hypothesized that children pre- and postnatally exposed to cyclone Aila have increased ADHD symptoms compared to the control group, and the effect depends on the timing of the exposure. Indian children (8–11 years) prenatally (N = 336) and early postnatally (N = 216) exposed to cyclone Aila were compared to a non-exposed control peer group (N = 285). ADHD symptoms were assessed using the Conner’s Teacher Rating Scale Revised. The main effect of exposure to the cyclone on the total ADHD symptoms’ score, ADHD index, Hyperactivity and Oppositional symptoms was significant and independent to covariates: age and sex of children, gestational age and birth weight, maternal stress during the year before the study and the socioeconomic status of a family. The timing of exposure and sex of the children were found to be a significant moderator of the relation between early exposure to the natural disaster and ADHD symptoms. The prenatal, but also early postnatal exposure to stressful experiences such as a natural disaster, may disturb the development of cognitive functions and behavioural control, thus increasing the risk of ADHD in children. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: Investigate an association between severe tropical cyclones (TCs) and birth outcomes in an Australian population. Methods: We analysed over 600,000 singleton livebirths collected through the Queensland Perinatal Data Collection between 2008 and 2018. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) of adverse birth outcomes using logistic multi-level modelling. Results: Exposure to TCs in early pregnancy was associated with significantly higher odds of preterm births in affected compared to unaffected areas during the TC year [OR=1.28, 95%CI=1.11, 1.49, p=0.001] and slightly significant higher odds in affected areas during TC years compared to non-TC years. Significantly higher odds of low birthweight births were associated with mid-pregnancy exposure to cyclone Marcia [OR=1.62, 95%CI=1.00, 2.40, p=0.016]. Conclusions: Findings aligned with studies demonstrating an association between exposure to environmental stressors in early to mid-pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes. Implications for public health: There is limited research into TCs and perinatal health in Australia despite most of the population residing along coastlines and TCs presenting one of the nation's most devastating weather events. This study will inform public health practice and contribute to further research into mitigating environmental risks faced by pregnant women. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Equestrian sport in Ireland is an extremely popular sport undertaken by many and considered by most to be a relatively safe pursuit. The aim of this study was to identify the incidence and severity of pelvic injuries in female amateur horse riders, referred to the Irish National Pelvic & Acetabular Referral Centre. The study was particularly focused on women of childbearing age, given the potentially catastrophic adverse outcomes associated with these injury patterns and the profound impact these injuries can have on both lifestyle and future childbirth. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients referred to the National Centre for Pelvic and Acetabular Trauma over a 30-month period from January 2018 through July 2020. Information was garnered from the national referral database, patient specific chart analysis and a review of images from the National Integrated Medical Imaging System (NIMIS). We identified a cohort of 16 females of childbearing age who sustained pelvic injuries while horse riding during this period. Four of these patients warranted surgical intervention, and with a minimum 6-month follow-up period, all were progressing satisfactorily. A review of the literature outlined the potential for profound adverse outcomes in young females suffering pelvic fractures, particularly in relation to genitourinary and pregnancy related complications. Caution should be exerted by all women of childbearing age engaging in recreational equine pursuits, and we would emphasise the importance of safety messaging and increased protective equipment for these athletes. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Climate change is accelerating the intensity and frequency of wildfires globally. Understanding how wildfire smoke (WS) may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and alterations in placental function via biological mechanisms is critical to mitigate the harms of exposure. We aim to review the literature surrounding WS, placental biology, biological mechanisms underlying adverse pregnancy outcomes as well as interventions and strategies to avoid WS exposure in pregnancy. This review includes epidemiologic and experimental laboratory-based studies of WS, air pollution, particulate matter (PM), and other chemicals related to combustion in relation to obstetric outcomes and placental biology. We summarized the available clinical, animal, and placental studies with WS and other combustion products such as tobacco, diesel, and wood smoke. Additionally, we reviewed current recommendations for prevention of WS exposure. We found that there is limited data specific to WS; however, studies on air pollution and other combustion sources suggest a link to inflammation, oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, DNA damage, telomere shortening, epigenetic changes, as well as metabolic, vascular, and endothelial dysregulation in the maternal-fetal unit. These alterations in placental biology contribute to adverse obstetric outcomes that disproportionally affect the most vulnerable. Limiting time outdoors, wearing N95 respirator face masks and using high quality indoor air filters during wildfire events reduces exposure to related environmental exposures and may mitigate morbidities attributable to WS. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Climate change is drastically altering the frequency, duration, and severity of compound drought-heatwave (CDHW) episodes, which present a new challenge in environmental and socioeconomic sectors. These threats are of particular importance in low-income regions with growing populations, fragile infrastructure, and threatened ecosystems. This review synthesizes emerging progress in the understanding of CDHW patterns in Brazil while providing insights about the impacts on fire occurrence and public health. Evidence is mounting that heatwaves are becoming increasingly linked with droughts in northeastern and southeastern Brazil, the Amazonia, and the Pantanal. In those regions, recent studies have begun to build a better understanding of the physical mechanisms behind CDHW events, such as the soil moisture–atmosphere coupling, promoted by exceptional atmospheric blocking conditions. Results hint at a synergy between CDHW events and high fire activity in the country over the last decades, with the most recent example being the catastrophic 2020 fires in the Pantanal. Moreover, we show that HWs were responsible for increasing mortality and preterm births during record-breaking droughts in southeastern Brazil. This work paves the way for a more in-depth understanding on CDHW events and their impacts, which is crucial to enhance the adaptive capacity of different Brazilian sectors. © 2022 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Background: From November 2019 to January 2020, eastern Australia experienced the worst bushfires in recorded history. Two months later, Sydney and surrounds were placed into lockdown for six weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by ongoing restrictions. Many pregnant women at this time were exposed to both the bushfires and COVID-19 restrictions. Objective: To assess the impact of exposure to bushfires and pandemic restrictions on perinatal outcomes. Methods: The study included 60 054 pregnant women who gave birth between November 2017 and December 2020 in South Sydney. Exposure cohorts were based on conception and birthing dates: 1) bushfire late pregnancy, born before lockdown; 2) bushfires in early-mid pregnancy, born during lockdown or soon after; 3) conceived during bushfires, lockdown in second trimester; 4) conceived after bushfires, pregnancy during restrictions. Exposure cohorts were compared with pregnancies in the matching periods in the two years prior. Associations between exposure cohorts and gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, hypertension, stillbirth, mode of birth, birthweight, preterm birth and small for gestational age were assessed using generalised estimating equations, adjusting for covariates. Results: A decrease in low birth weight was observed for cohort 1 (aOR 0.81, 95%CI 0.69, 0.95). Conversely, cohort 2 showed an increase in low birth weight, and increases in prelabour rupture of membranes, and caesarean sections (aOR 1.18, 95%CI 1.03, 1.37; aOR 1.21, 95%CI 1.07, 1.37; aOR 1.10 (1.02, 1.18) respectively). Cohort 3 showed an increase in unplanned caesarean sections and high birth weight babies (aOR 1.15, 95%CI 1.04, 1.27 and aOR 1.16, 95%CI 1.02, 1.31 respectively), and a decrease in gestational diabetes mellitus was observed for both cohorts 3 and 4. Conclusion: Pregnancies exposed to both severe climate events and pandemic disruptions appear to have increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes beyond only experiencing one event, but further research is needed. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to implement pediatric vertical evacuation disaster training and evaluate its effectiveness by using a full-scale exercise to compare outcomes in trained and untrained participants. Methods: Various clinical and nonclinical staff in a tertiary care university hospital received pediatric vertical evacuation training sessions over a 6-wk period. The training consisted of disaster and evacuation didactics, hands-on training in use of evacuation equipment, and implementation of an evacuation toolkit. An unannounced full-scale simulated vertical evacuation of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the training. Drill participants completed a validated evaluation tool. Pearson chi-squared testing was used to analyze the data. Results: Eighty-four evaluations were received from drill participants. Forty-three (51%) of the drill participants received training and 41 (49%) did not. Staff who received pediatric evacuation training were more likely to feel prepared compared with staff who did not (odds ratio, 4.05; confidence interval: 1.05-15.62). Conclusions: There was a statistically significant increase in perceived preparedness among those who received training. Recently trained pediatric practitioners were able to achieve exercise objectives on par with the regularly trained emergency department staff. Pediatric disaster preparedness training may mitigate the risks associated with caring for children during disasters. ©

AB  - The effects of natural and technological disasters on human, the environment, economy and social life can be prevented via scientific and technological developments. Especially, international scientific studies provide a better understanding of the nature, characteristics and effects of disasters. Therefore, a more resilient community can be built after disasters by reducing the damages of disasters at national and international level. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the disaster resilience of countries. In this study, by analyzing the data of 181 countries in 2018 and 2019, the rate of total population affected by disasters was employed as dependent variable and the factors indicating the development level of countries as independent variables. The data were analyzed with the help of ArcGIS 10.7 program using ordinary least squares regression analysis that reveals general relationships and geographical weighted regression analysis that shows local relationships across study area. In conclusion, in the general model, compulsory education duration in 2018 was the only variable that positively and significantly predicted the rate of total population affected by disasters. While neonatal mortality rate and unemployment predicted positively and significantly the rate of total population affected by disasters in 2019, urban population rate predicted negatively and significantly. The effect of all the independent variables on the rate of total population affected by disasters differed depending on time and region. The result of this study is expected to contribute to the national and international organizations responsible for disaster risk reduction efforts to prepare more effective and efficient disaster plans. In addition, the method and approach of this study may give an idea to scientists investigating on disasters. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although radioactivity is released routinely at every stage of nuclear power generation, the regulation of these releases has never taken into account those potentially most sensitive - women, especially when pregnant, and children. From uranium mining and milling, to fuel manufacture, electricity generation and radioactive waste management, children in frontline and Indigenous communities can be disproportionately harmed due to often increased sensitivity of developing systems to toxic exposures, the lack of resources and racial and class discrimination. The reasons for the greater susceptibility of women and children to harm from radiation exposure is not fully understood. Regulatory practices, particularly in the establishment of protective exposure standards, have failed to take this difference into account. Anecdotal evidence within communities around nuclear facilities suggests an association between radiation exposure and increases in birth defects, miscarriages and childhood cancers. A significant number of academic studies tend to ascribe causality to other factors related to diet and lifestyle and dismiss these health indicators as statistically insignificant. In the case of a major release of radiation due to a serious nuclear accident, children are again on the frontlines, with a noted susceptibility to thyroid cancer, which has been found in significant numbers among children exposed both by the 1986 Chornobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine and the 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan. The response among authorities in Japan is to blame increased testing or to reduce testing. More independent studies are needed focused on children, especially those in vulnerable frontline and Indigenous communities. In conducting such studies, greater consideration must be applied to culturally significant traditions and habits in these communities. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

AB  - Background: Indonesia is an archipelagic country that has a high potential for disaster. This is due to Indonesia's position at the equator and its wide geographic area and diverse demographics. Pregnant women are priority group because they are susceptible to nutritional problems during disasters. Pregnant women who are malnourished have a high potential for premature delivery, giving birth to babies with low birth weight and even death for mothers and children so that they become a real health threat. This research focuses on the nutritional needs of pregnant women in disaster. Methods: The method used is a cross sectional method. This research was carried out by a literature study that published about pregnant women’s during disaster in Indonesia databases. Inclusion criteria are research that focuses on the management of nutrition for pregnant women in disaster emergencies. Results: Health problems frequently occurs in pregnant women, namely not being aware of the increased nutritional needs during pregnancy, especially during a disaster, so there is a risk of decreasing in maternal nutritional status. There are several nutritional treatments for pregnant women that can be carried out during disaster such as measuring nutritional status, managing needs and food for pregnant women, as well as providing additional food and supplements for pregnant women such as blood-added tablets, folic acid, calcium, etc. Conclusion: Management of nutrition during disaster emergency can help to maintain nutritional control in pregnant women and ensure the health of both the mother and the fetus. © 2022, Dr Tarak Nath Podder Memorial Foundation.

AB  - Objective A non-negligible proportion of sub-Saharan African (SSA) households experience catastrophic costs accessing healthcare. This study aimed to systematically review the existing evidence to identify factors associated with catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) incidence in the region. Methods We searched PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, CNKI, Africa Journal Online, SciELO, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, and supplemented these with search of grey literature, pre-publication server deposits, Google Scholar®, and citation tracking of included studies. We assessed methodological quality of included studies using the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies for quantitative studies and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for qualitative studies; and synthesized study findings according to the guidelines of the Economic and Social Research Council. Results We identified 82 quantitative, 3 qualitative, and 4 mixed-methods studies involving 3,112,322 individuals in 650,297 households in 29 SSA countries. Overall, we identified 29 population-level and 38 disease-specific factors associated with CHE incidence in the region. Significant population-level CHE-associated factors were rural residence, poor socioeconomic status, absent health insurance, large household size, unemployed household head, advanced age (elderly), hospitalization, chronic illness, utilization of specialist healthcare, and utilization of private healthcare providers. Significant distinct disease-specific factors were disability in a household member for NCDs; severe malaria, blood transfusion, neonatal intensive care, and distant facilities for maternal and child health services; emergency surgery for surgery/trauma patients; and low CD4-count, HIV and TB co-infection, and extra-pulmonary TB for HIV/TB patients. Conclusions Multiple household and health system level factors need to be addressed to improve financial risk protection and healthcare access and utilization in SSA.

AB  - Climate change is likely to have wide-ranging impacts on maternal and neonatal health in Africa. Populations in low-resource settings already experience adverse impacts from weather extremes, a high burden of disease from environmental exposures, and limited access to high-quality clinical care. Climate change is already increasing local temperatures. Neonates are at high risk of heat stress and dehydration due to their unique metabolism, physiology, growth, and developmental characteristics. Infants in low-income settings may have little protection against extreme heat due to housing design and limited access to affordable space cooling. Climate change may increase risks to neonatal health from weather disasters, decreasing food security, and facilitating infectious disease transmission. Effective interventions to reduce risks from the heat include health education on heat risks for mothers, caregivers, and clinicians; nature-based solutions to reduce urban heat islands; space cooling in health facilities; and equitable improvements in housing quality and food systems. Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are essential to reduce the long-term impacts of climate change that will further undermine global health strategies to reduce neonatal mortality. © 2022

AB  - Most historiographies of the crossroads of environmental and reproductive health in 20th century start and end with the case of thalidomide. Despite its global scope, thalidomide today stands for sharp contrasts: in the numbers of victims, in institutional responses to the disaster, and also—more generally—in regulatory approaches to potential risks and national cultures of reproductive justice and disability rights. This paper takes a closer look at two countries that have been seen as emblematic of this divide in regulatory frameworks, despite similarities and interconnections in other areas, such as (pharma)industrial production, science, and robust feminist environmental health movements: the U.S. and West Germany. It argues that thalidomide needs to be historically contextualized within a broad framework of concepts and models of environment from research on exogenous reproductive effects. To do so, it reconstructs what counted as environment in research on reproductive health and birth defects in these two national settings in the postwar decades. It looks at transformations made across multifaceted initiatives, studying collective landscapes and workplaces as potentially dangerous “outer worlds,” as well as smaller scale and more individualized environments, i.e., the maternal metabolism, uterus, lifestyle, or social interactions. The article thereby aims to explicate concepts and debates about the environment that influenced later national divisions in politics of science and technology, hinting of the democratic challenges these posed. © 2022

AB  - Globally, 21 percent of young women are married before their 18th birthday. Despite some progress in addressing child marriage, it remains a widespread practice, in particular in South Asia. While household predictors of child marriage have been studied extensively in the literature, the evidence base on macro-economic factors contributing to child marriage and models that predict where child marriage cases are most likely to occur remains limited. In this paper we aim to fill this gap and explore region-level indicators to predict the persistence of child marriage in four countries in South Asia, namely Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. We apply machine learning techniques to child marriage data and develop a prediction model that relies largely on regional and local inputs such as droughts, floods, population growth and nightlight data to model the incidence of child marriages. We find that our gradient boosting model is able to identify a large proportion of the true child marriage cases and correctly classifies 77% of the true marriage cases, with a higher accuracy in Bangladesh (92% of the cases) and a lower accuracy in Nepal (70% of cases). In addition, all countries contain in their top 10 variables for classification nighttime light growth, a shock index of drought over the previous and the last two years and the regional level of education, suggesting that income shocks, regional economic activity and regional education levels play a significant role in predicting child marriage. Given the accuracy of the model to predict child marriage, our model is a valuable tool to support policy design in countries where household-level data remains limited. ©: © 2022 Dietrich et al.

AB  - Emergencies, such as natural and manmade disasters, can present an opportunity or be a detriment to preventive healthcare. While stay-at-home orders which some states implemented to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 are known to reduce acute and routine care, little is known about missed preventive care. Dental care, unlike other forms of preventive care - such as pediatric vaccines and well-visits, is simpler to analyze as it is not practicable with telehealth. Using weekly foot traffic data by SafeGraph from January 2018 to June 2020, we examine the effect of stay-at-home orders on visits to dental offices, finding a 15.4% decline after March 2020 for states with stay-at-home orders. Surprisingly, we find that states which allowed dental care during the stay-at-home period experienced a further 7.4% decline in visits. Using Michigan Medicaid dental claims for children we find that the decline of 0.25 claims per month is driven primarily by fewer diagnostic and preventive care visits. Though some preventive visits were rescheduled, we estimate only 58% of visits missed in March and April 2020 were made up by the end of the year. These estimates quantify the short-term declines in preventive dental care, suggesting similar declines in other preventive care. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown associations between maternal stress and poor birth outcomes, but evidence is unclear for causal inference. Natural disasters provide an opportunity to study effects of quasi-randomized hardship with an accurate measure of onset and duration. In a population-based quasi-experimental study, we examined the effect of maternal exposure to the January 1998 Québec ice storm on birth outcomes by comparing pregnant mothers who lived in an area hard hit by the ice storm with those in two unaffected regions. In a total of 147,349 singleton births between 1995 and 2001, we used a difference-in-differences method to estimate the effects of the ice storm on gestational age at delivery (GA), preterm birth (PTB), weight-for-gestational-age z-scores (BWZ), large for gestational age (LGA), and small for gestational age (SGA). After adjusting for maternal and sociodemographic characteristics, there were no differences between the exposed and the unexposed mothers for birth outcomes. The estimated differences (exposed vs. unexposed) were 0.01 SDs (95% CI:-0.02, 0.05) for BWZ; 0.10% point (95% CI:-0.95%, 1.16%) for SGA; 0.25% point (95% CI:-0.78%, 1.28%) for LGA;-0.01 week (95% CI:-0.07, 0.05) for GA; and 0.16% point (95% CI:-0.66%, 0.97%) for PTB. Neither trimester-specific nor dose-response associations were observed. Overall, exposure to the 1998 Québec ice storm as a proxy for acute maternal stress in pregnancy was not associated with poor birth outcomes. Our results suggest that acute maternal hardship may not have a substantial effect on adverse birth outcomes. ©

AB  - (1) Background: The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis links adverse fetal exposures with developmental mal-adaptations and morbidity later in life. Short- and long-term exposures to air pollutants are known contributors to health outcomes; however, the potential for developmental health effects of air pollution exposures during gestation or early-childhood have yet to be reviewed and synthesized from a DOHaD lens. The objective of this study is to summarize the literature on cardiovascular and metabolic, respiratory, allergic, and neuropsychological health outcomes, from prenatal development through early childhood, associated with early-life exposures to outdoor air pollutants, including traffic-related and wildfire-generated air pollutants. (2) Methods: We conducted a search using PubMed and the references of articles previously known to the authors. We selected papers that investigated health outcomes during fetal or childhood development in association with early-life ambient or source-specific air pollution exposure. (3) Results: The current literature reports that prenatal and early-childhood exposures to ambient and traffic-related air pollutants are associated with a range of adverse outcomes in early life, including cardiovascular and metabolic, respiratory and allergic, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Very few studies have investigated associations between wildfire-related air pollution exposure and health outcomes during prenatal, postnatal, or childhood development. (4) Conclusion: Evidence from January 2000 to January 2022 supports a role for prenatal and early-childhood air pollution exposures adversely affecting health outcomes during development. Future studies are needed to identify both detrimental air pollutants from the exposure mixture and critical exposure time periods, investigate emerging exposure sources such as wildfire, and develop feasible interventional tools. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as wildfires are expected to increase due to climate change. Childbearing women, that is, women who are pregnant, soon to be pregnant, or have recently given birth, may be particularly vulnerable to the effect of wildfire exposure. OBJECTIVES: This review sought to systematically assess what is known about birth outcomes, health, and health care needs of childbearing women during and after exposure to wildfires. METHODS: An integrative review methodology was utilized to enable article selection, data extraction, and synthesis across qualitative and quantita-tive studies. Comprehensive searches of SCOPUS (including MEDLINE and Embase), CINAHL, PubMed, and Google Scholar identified studies for inclusion with no date restriction. Included studies were independently appraised by two reviewers using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool. The findings are summarized and illustrated in tables. RESULTS: Database searches identified 480 records. Following title, abstract, and full text screening, sixteen studies published between 2012 and 2022 were identified for this review. Eleven studies considered an association between in utero exposure to wildfire and impacts on birth weight and length of gestation. One study reported increased rates of maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and gestational hypertension following exposure; whereas one study reported differences in the secondary sex ratio. Two studies reported higher incidence of birth defects following in utero exposure to wildfire smoke. Three studies reported increased mental health morbidity, and one study associated a reduction in breastfeeding among women who evac-uated from a wildfire disaster. DISCUSSION: Evidence indicates that wildfire exposure may be associated with changes to birth outcomes and increased morbidity for childbearing women and their babies. These effects may be profound and have long-term and wide-ranging public health implications. This research can inform the development of effective clinical and public health strategies to address the needs of childbearing women exposed to wildfire disaster. https://doi. org/10.1289/EHP10544. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

AB  - Climate change is a major risk factor for overall health, including reproductive health, and well-being. Increasing temperatures, due mostly to increased greenhouse gases trapping excess heat in the atmosphere, result in erratic weather patterns, wildfires, displacement of large communities, and stagnant water resulting in vector-borne diseases that, together, have set the stage for new and devastating health threats across the globe. These conditions disproportionately affect disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, including women, pregnant persons, young children, the elderly, and the disabled. This review reports on the evidence for the adverse impacts of air pollution, wildfires, heat stress, floods, toxic chemicals, and vector-borne diseases on male and female fertility, the developing fetus, and obstetric outcomes. Reproductive health care providers are uniquely positioned and have an unprecedented opportunity to educate patients and policy makers about mitigating the impact of climate change to assure reproductive health in this and future generations. © 2022

AB  - Background: Exposure to landscape fire smoke (LFS) is linked to child mortality and birthweight. It is unknown whether gestational exposure to LFS affects child survival rate. We aimed to link under-five death (U5D) to gestational LFS exposure by performing a causal mediation analysis based on birthweight. Method: We conducted a sibling-matched case-control study of children under 5 years of age who were affiliated with the same mothers from Demographic and Health Surveys in 54 low- and middle-income countries, during the period from 2000 to 2014. LFS exposure was quantified as the surface concentration of fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) attributable to landscape fires, estimated using a global atmospheric model. Three pairwise associations between fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf>, birthweight, and U5D were assessed using fixed-effects regressions. We used a bootstrap-based mediation test of regression coefficients to examine whether the LFS-birthweight-U5D pathway was statistically significant. We also conducted three pairwise exposure-response functions using nonlinear models and used them to estimate the pathway-specific disease burden from 2000 to 2014. Results: After adjustments for multiple confounders, each 1-µg/m3 increase in gestational exposure to fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> was associated with a reduction of 2.179 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −3.777, −0.580) g in birthweight. Each 1-g birthweight reduction was associated with a 0.072% (95% CI: 0.065%, 0.078%) increase in U5D. Furthermore, each increase in exposure to fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> was associated with a 2.853% (95% CI: 0.835%, 4.911%) increase in U5D; 7.294% (95% CI: 0.710%, 24.254%) of the linkage was explained by LFS-attributable birthweight reduction. Based on the estimated exposure-response functions, from 2000 to 2014, global exposure to fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> contributed a mean birthweight reduction of 10.30 (95% CI: 2.93, 19.47) g, contributing to 60,350 (18,111, 106,619) premature U5Ds annually. Conclusion: In low- and middle-income countries, gestational exposure to LFS can increase mortality during infancy; appropriate interventions are needed to promote health in childhood. © 2022

AB  - Climate change continues to have a detrimental effect on the overall health of people globally. The average yearly temperature has continually risen since the late 19th century and is projected to continue rising for decades ahead. Increased temperature has been linked to decreased sleep quality and increased heat strokes and pregnancy complications. Adverse effects on cardiopulmonary health have been linked to climate change. Air pollution is correlated to an increased risk of myocardial infarctions and aggravation of symptoms pertaining to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. Lengthening of the pollination season because of warmer weather due to climate change has led to an increase in allergy-related rhinitis and asthma. Temperature increases have caused a lengthening of the transmission season of infectious disease, especially vector and water-borne diseases. Infectious disease has begun to spread to new areas globally due to increased temperatures, rainfall and flooding attributed to climate change. The mental health impacts attributed to climate change, including depression and anxiety, are escalating. With increased floods and hurricanes, people of certain geographic areas can experience an increase in acute stress, which may lead to chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. Family physicians are at the forefront of advising patients on how to handle the health effects of climate change. In addition to climate change’s impact on health, patients of lower socioeconomic status are more at risk because of lack of adequate resources and financial stability. Through detailed histories, family physicians have an opportunity to identify affected patients and intervene earlier. © 2022 by the American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians.

AB  - Background Ethiopia is a Sub-Saharan country with very high neonatal mortality rates, varying across its regions. The rate of neonatal mortality reduction in Ethiopia is slow, and Ethiopia may not meet the third United Nations sustainable development target by 2030. This study aimed to investigate the spatial variations and contributing factors for neonatal mortality rates in Ethiopia. Methods We analysed data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS), which used a two-stage cluster sampling technique with a census enumeration area as primary and households as secondary sampling units. A Bayesian spatial logistic regression model using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) method was fitted accounting for socio-economic, health service-related and geographic factors. Results Higher neonatal mortality rates were observed in eastern, northeastern and southeastern Ethiopia, and the Somali region had higher risks of neonatal mortality. Neonates from frequently drought-affected areas had a higher mortality risk than less drought-affected areas. Application of traditional substances on the cord increased the risk of neonatal mortality (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.07, 95% Credible Interval (CrI): 1.12 to 4.30) and getting health facility delivery services had a lower odds of neonatal mortality (AOR = 0.60, 95% CrI: 0.37, 0.98). Conclusions Residing in drought-affected areas, applying traditional substances on the umbilical cord and not delivering at health facilities were associated with a higher risk of neonatal mortality. Policy-makers and resource administrators at different administrative levels could leverage the findings to prioritise and target areas identified with higher neonatal mortality rates. © 2022 Kibret et al.

AB  - The PROTECT research Center funded by the NIH’s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Superfund Research Program was launched in 2010 to explore the impact of exposure to pollutants on the high rate of premature births in Puerto Rico. In September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and María devastated the archipelago, which caused: collapse of the electrical system, collapse of the communication system, limited access to clean water, food, gas, and health services, destruction of public (e.g., hospitals) and private property (e.g., houses) and more than 4500 deaths. Pregnant and postpartum individuals are especially vulnerable to natural disasters. They face difficulty obtaining adequate pre-and post-natal care, are exposed to increased risk of miscarriage, premature delivery, and giving birth to low birth weight babies during and after disasters and are also more likely to suffer physical and mental health problems compared to the general population during and after disasters. A face-to-face questionnaire was administered to PROTECT participants who were pregnant during hurricanes Irma or Maria or who became pregnant shortly after in order to identify hurricane-related sources of stress and other adverse effects. This paper is based on the answers to the open-ended question at the end of the questionnaire where participants were asked to share their experiences during and after the hurricanes. Among the 375 participants who completed the survey, 76 answers to the open-ended question were considered due to data saturation. The answers to the open-ended question were transcribed into a document in order to facilitate the coding process. The transcribed text was analyzed first to identify emerging categories and then coded to identify common themes as well as divergence among participants. The following themes were identified: pregnancy and birth challenges, lack of access to basic services, housing conditions, stressful working conditions, concerns about health, concerns about their children, and positive or protective aspects. The results indicate how the disruption in access to basic services has a unique impact on the physical and mental health of pregnant and post-partum women in an emergency situation. These findings point to the potential benefit of developing specific protocols designed for emergency preparedness aimed at this population, which can inform healthcare providers and community organizations in case of future events. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Air pollution exposure has been associated with critical neonatal morbidities, including low birth weight (LBW). However, little is known on short-term exposure to wildfire smoke and LBW. In this study, we estimated the association between birth weight following pregnancy and wildfire smoke exposure in more than 1.5 million newborns in Brazil (considered as a very fire-prone region worldwide). Methods: We applied a logistic regression model to estimate the percent variation in newborns with low birth weight when exposed to wildfire in different trimesters of the pregnancy. Findings: After adjusting the model with relevant covariates, we found that an increase of 100 wildfire records in Brazil was associated with an increase in low birth weight in the Midwest region [0.98% (95%CI:0.34; 1.63)] and in the South region [18.55% (95%CI:13.66; 23.65)] when the exposure occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy. Interpretation: Wildfires were associated with LBW and this should be of public health concern for policymakers.

AB  - Background: Birth defects are a major cause of poor health outcomes during both childhood and adulthood. A growing body of evidence demonstrated associations between air pollution exposure during pregnancy and birth defects. To date, there is no study looking at birth defects and exposure to wildfire-related air pollution, which is suggested as a type of air pollution source with high toxicity for reproductive health. Objective: Our study addresses this gap by examining the association between birth defects and wildfire smoke exposure in Brazil between 2001 and 2018. Based on known differences of impacts of wildfires across different regions of Brazil, we hypothesized differences in risks of birth defects for different regions. Methods: We used a logistic regression model to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for individual birth defects (12 categories) associated with wildfire exposure during each trimester of pregnancy. Results: Among the 16,825,497 birth records in our study population, there were a total of 7595 infants born in Brazil between 2001 and 2018 with birth defects in any of the selected categories. After adjusting for several confounders in the primary analysis, we found statistically significant OR for three birth defects, including cleft lip/cleft palate [OR: 1.007 (95% CI: 1.001; 1.013)] during the second trimester of exposure, congenital anomalies of the respiratory system [OR: 1.013 (95% CI: 1.002; 1.023)] in the second trimester of exposure, and congenital anomalies of the nervous system [OR: 1.002 (95% CI: 1.001; 1.003)] during the first trimester of exposure for the regions South, North, and Midwest, respectively. Significance: Our results suggest that maternal exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of an infant being born with some congenital anomaly. Considering that birth defects are associated with long-term disability, impacting families and the healthcare system (e.g., healthcare costs), our findings should be of great concern to the public health community. Impact statement: Our study focused on the association between maternal exposure to wildfire smoke in Brazil during pregnancy and the risk of an infant being born with congenital anomalies, which presents serious public health and environmental challenges. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Hospitalized neonates are vulnerable to natural and man-made disasters because of their persistent requirement for medical resources and may need to be evacuated to safe locations when electricity and medical gas supply become unreliable. In Japan, a triage system for hospitalized neonates, or the Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment for Neonates, Revised (START-Neo-R), has been used to determine whether neonates are in suitable conditions for transportation. However, this scale is not useful to determine the evacuation order of neonates because a considerable number of evacuees are classified into the same categories. Study Objective: To solve this problem, a novel triage system, Neonatal Extrication Triage (NEXT) was developed. This study tested the validity and reproducibility of both triages and compared them with a standardized prognostic scoring system for hospitalized neonates, the Neonatal Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (NTISS). Methods: In this retrospective observational study, physicians and nurses independently assessed each neonate hospitalized at a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) twice weekly using NEXT and START-Neo-R. The NEXT system comprises six questionnaires regarding medical resources required during transition and transportation, providing composite scores on a 12-point scale. The START-Neo-R classified neonates into five levels based on the severity of disease and dependence on medical care. Inter-rater reliability of both systems was assessed using Cohen’s kappa coefficient, whereas the criterion validity with NTISS was assessed using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Results: Overall, 162 neonates were assessed for 49 days, resulting in triage data for 1,079 accumulated patients. Both NEXT scores and START-Neo-R ranks were well-dispersed across different levels without excessive accumulation in specific categories. Inter-rater reliability of NEXT (kappa coefficient, 0.973; 95% confidence interval, 0.969-0.976) and START-Neo-R (kappa coefficient, 0.952; 95% confidence interval, 0.946-0.957) between physicians and nurses was sufficiently high. The correlation coefficient of NEXT and START-Neo-R scores with NTISS scores were 0.889 (P <.001) and 0.850 (P <.001), respectively. Conclusions: Both START-Neo-R and NEXT had good reproducibility and correlation with the severity of neonates indicated by NTISS. With its well-dispersed scores across different levels, the NEXT system might be a powerful tool to determine the priority of evacuation objectively. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - There are about 200 million people on the move in the world, and approximately 50% of them are women. There are no clear migration plans for women leaving as a result of persecution, war, famine, climatic disasters or moving away from contexts of external abuse and even intrafamily violence. Gender-related violence, to which women are exposed in cultural contexts characterized by a patriarchal social organization, is manifested through different ways including, but not limited to, early marriages and genital mutilation, with reproductive health already being seriously impaired at an early age. To this must be added the consideration that low-income countries are not able to deal with chronic degenerative diseases with a multidisciplinary approach such as diabetes. Fragile or non-existent health systems are not prepared for this need, which now affects a third of all deaths from this cause. Compared to Italian mothers, women from high-migration pressure countries had a higher risk of gestational diabetes; in addition, young women of Ethiopian ethnicity are more exposed to increased diabetes risk, in an age- and BMI-dependent way. Gender inequalities are also more evident in migrants for other non-communicable diseases besides diabetes. A major effort is needed in terms of training practitioners and reorganization of basic health services, making them competent in an intercultural sense. Health education of the population as a whole and of women specifically is also needed to contain risk behavior and prevent the early onset of metabolic syndromes in general and of type 2 diabetes in particular. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Background: Women are at higher risk of death during disasters due to physical, biological, psychological, and cultural differences. After a disaster, they experience more miscarriages, premature births, inadequate fetal growth, low birth weight, sexual violence, and unwanted pregnancies. This study aims to investigate the reproductive health status of women affected by the 2017 earthquake in Kermanshah, Iran. Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in 2018. The study population consists of women aged 15-49 years (Mean age=31.7 years) living in Sarpol-e Zahab, Javanrood, and Thalas Babajani towns in Kermanshah city affected by the earthquake in 2017. The questionnaire used for assessing the status of reproductive health in women was the Reproductive Health Assessment Questionnaire for Women of Reproductive Age, which has already been localized in Iran and its reliability and validity have been confirmed. Native Kurdish language experts completed the questionnaires on behalf of 396 participants. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the variables. Results: It was found that 42.4% of women complained of abnormal menstruation and 34.09% of limited menstrual hygiene materials. Sixty women were pregnant at the time of the earthquake, all of whom gave birth in hospital; two had miscarriages, two had premature births, and one had stillbirth. Urinary tract infection was the most common problem (21%) in pregnant women. Moreover, 48% of women used contraceptive methods after the earthquake, the most commonly used method was the use of contraceptive pills (23%). Access to contraception methods was difficult for 14.4% of them after the earthquake. Furthermore, 25% had experienced violence after the earthquake; of these, 30 reported physical violence, 86 verbal violence, and 13 sexual violence. Conclusion: The control of pregnancy and safe delivery in earthquake-affected areas of Kermanshah is relatively acceptable; however, the provision of reproductive health services seems to be challenging. It is recommended to pay attention to the menstrual hygiene of women and regular distribution of contraceptives (despite the current population growth plan), address sexual acts of violence, and develop a protocol to support the victims. © 2022, Negah Institute for Scientific Communication.

AB  - Introduction: One of the goals of the third millennium development is maternal and neonatal health. One of the harmful factors of health is natural disasters. This study was performed aimed to determine maternal complications in Kermanshah earthquake in 2017. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 850 women who had delivery in Imam Khomeini hospital of Eslam Abad Gharb. The earthquake group included the women who had delivered in the earthquake of 2017 and the non-earthquake group included the women who were delivered in the same hospital in 2016. All data obtained from patients' records. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 21) and Independent t-test, and Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square and Fisher exact test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: In women who had delivered in an earthquake, prevalence of maternal complications included preterm labour in 99 (22.3%), premature rupture of membrane in 30 (7.05%), caesarean section in 179 (42.1%), postpartum hemorrhage in 42 (9.9%), gestational hypertension in 24 (5.6%) and abortion in 11 (2.58%). In women who had delivered in 2016, there were preterm labor in 51 (11%), premature rupture of membrane in 12 (2.8 %), caesarean section in 153 (36%), postpartum hemorrhage in 20 (5%), gestational hypertension in 9 (2.1%) and abortion in 2 (0.5%). There were significant differences between the two groups in all cases (P<0.05). Conclusion: Natural disasters such as earthquakes can increase maternal complications. Therefore, necessary precautions and health care should be increased in the event of a natural disaster. © 2022, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Despite the rapid increase in knowledge about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is limited data on vertical transmission, viral loads in mother-neonate pairs, and health outcomes. We aimed to describe the characteristics, viral loads, and short-and mid-term outcomes of neonates born to mothers with confirmed COVID-19 infection in northern Iran. Materials and methods: In a cross-sectional study, we prospectively collected and analyzed the clinical features, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results, viral loads, and outcomes of 60 neonates delivered by 58 SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women in maternity hospitals of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences (northern Iran) during first three waves of the pandemic from March 1 to December 31, 2020. We assessed neonates' short and mid-term outcomes up to 24 months after the pandemic. We also described the timing of mother-to-infant transmission based on the classification presented by the World Health Organization. Results: Of the 17767 deliveries, 58 mothers had confirmed and probable COVID-19 infection. Twenty (33.3%) neonates were positive for SARS-CoV-2, two of whom had possible in utero transmission. Twenty-five (41.2%) neonates were preterm, most of whom were born during the first and second waves in which mothers were critically ill. 19 (31.7%) patients needed resuscitation in the delivery room. 34 (56.7%) neonates were isolated in the neonatal intensive care unit. We observed a significant relationship between the maternal and neonatal viral load (correlation coefficient = 0.983, P = 0.00). No neonatal death was observed and all babies had a good outcome. Conclusions: The results showed that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible but rare. Regional factors and severity of mother's disease may influence the clinical course of neonates. With increasing experience, proper observance of health precautions, and rapid development of evidence-based response systems for regional and global disasters, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to newborn is reduced. © 2022

AB  - Over the course of approximately 60 years, the field of pediatric urology has evolved as a convergence of pediatric surgery, urology, and plastic surgery to address congenital anomalies of the urinary tract and genitalia in children. Guidelines for training and certification are narrowing in high-income countries (HICs) at the same time as the fertility rate is declining and the prevalence of complex genitourinary (GU) conditions is decreasing. In low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), health systems for large populations are currently in a state of stress. Here we briefly review the history of pediatric urology as a surgical subspecialty, identify unmet needs especially in LMICs and place the field in the context of a global surgical ecosystem. Methods: The English language literature on workforce trends in pediatric urology, pediatric surgery and urology was reviewed as well as development of the emerging field of global surgery. Global surgery looks at the social, economic and political context of health systems as well as unmet clinical need. World trends in fertility rates were reviewed to identify regions of workforce surplus and gaps, supply chain needs, infrastructure and systems strengths and weaknesses. Results: The proliferation of training programs in pediatric surgery and specialties in high-income countries (HICs) coupled with declining birth rates has led to a saturation of specialists and declining surgical case load. In LMICs, while the birth rate has also been declining, surgical specialization has not progressed. In the lowest income countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, training in pediatric surgical specialties and urology is rare. The broad workforce that supports surgical care, such as anesthesia, intensivist pediatrics, radiology, laboratory, and nursing face similar challenges. Supply chains for specialized pediatric urological surgery are weak. Conclusion: There is an evolving maldistribution of pediatric surgical and pediatric urological workforce globally, with too few practitioners in LMICs and too many in HICs. The high cost of specialized equipment limits access to quality care, and the supply chain for consumables and medication is patchy. In LIC's, basic community-based infrastructure for health including reliable electricity is lacking. Recent experience with Covid and environmental disasters has highlighted that even in HICs surgical resilience can be challenged. This is an opportunity to consider the state of children's urological care globally and to build resilience by identifying and addressing strengths and gaps. © 2022 The Author

AB  - In times of epidemics and pandemics, depletion or diversion of health system resources from routine health care is common, posing serious threats to primary care. This study estimates the contemporaneous and long-run effects of health disasters on maternal and child mortality in 111 countries during 2000–2019 using two-way fixed-effects and two-step system general method of moments frameworks. We also provide evidence that indicates how health system capacity, public health infrastructure, health care coverage and financing, and social determinants of health can mitigate disaster effects. In low- and middle-income countries, health disasters increase maternal, under-5, and neonatal mortalities by 0.3%, 0.3%, and 0.2% instantaneously and by 35%, 80%, and 26% after one year, respectively. Our estimates show that emergency preparedness and response can prevent these effects. However, other mitigators, namely physician density, water, sanitation, and hygiene coverage, universal health coverage, education, gender equality, and financial inclusion have greater impact. © 2022 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland

AB  - Purpose of Review: Climate change is the biggest public health threat of the twenty-first century but its impact on the perinatal period has only recently received attention. This review summarizes recent literature regarding the impacts of climate change and related environmental disasters on pregnancy health and provides recommendations to inform future adaptation and mitigation efforts. Recent Findings: Accumulating evidence suggests that the changing climate affects pregnancy health directly via discrete environmental disasters (i.e., wildfire, extreme heat, hurricane, flood, and drought), and indirectly through changes in the natural and social environment. Although studies vary greatly in design, analytic methods, and assessment strategies, they generally converge to suggest that climate-related disasters are associated with increased risk of gestational complication, pregnancy loss, restricted fetal growth, low birthweight, preterm birth, and selected delivery/newborn complications. Window(s) of exposure with the highest sensitivity are not clear, but both acute and chronic exposures appear important. Furthermore, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations may be more vulnerable. Summary: Policy, clinical, and research strategies for adaptation and mitigation should be continued, strengthened, and expanded with cross-disciplinary efforts. Top priorities should include (a) reinforcing and expanding policies to further reduce emission, (b) increasing awareness and education resources for healthcare providers and the public, (c) facilitating access to quality population-based data in low-resource areas, and (d) research efforts to better understand mechanisms of effects, identify susceptible populations and windows of exposure, explore interactive impacts of multiple exposures, and develop novel methods to better quantify pregnancy health impacts. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Fenugreek is an annual leguminous crop native to Asia and Southeast Europe. Fenugreek is a short-duration winter forage crop and can tolerate drought. The fact that fenugreek produces high-quality forages in all growth stages, does not create bloat problem in cattle, and contains animal growth-promoting substances makes it an attractive forage crop. Irrigated fenugreek crop gives 250-350 q/ha green fodder but rainfed crop gives 150-250 q/ha. The average seed yield of fenugreek is 6-8 q/ha. The chemical compositions of fenugreek are crude protein (3.6%), ether extract (3.5%), crude fiber (7.1%), nitrogen-free extract (9.5%), and ash (2%) at the flowering stage on dry weight basis. Coumarin-like compounds present in fenugreek may interfere with the activity and dosing of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs and cause birth defects in animals and it can pass through the placenta. © 2019 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Iodine is an essential element for the production of thyroid hormones (THs). Both deficient and excess iodine intakes may precipitate in adverse thyroidal events. Radioactive iodine (RI) is a common byproduct of nuclear fission processes. During nuclear emergencies RI may be released in a plume, or cloud, contaminating the environment. If inhaled or ingested, it may lead to internal radiation exposure and the uptake of RI mainly by the thyroid gland that absorbs stable iodine (SI) and RI in the same way. A dose of radiation delivered to the thyroid gland is a main risk factor for the thyroid cancer development. The SI prophylaxis helps prevent childhood thyroid cancer. The thyroid gland saturation with prophylactic SI ingestion, reduces the internal exposure of the thyroid by blocking the uptake of RI and inhibiting iodide organification. However, negative impact of inadequate SI intake must be considered. We provide an overview on the recommended iodine intake and the impact of SI and RI on thyroid in children and adolescents, discussing the benefits and adverse effects of the prophylactic SI for thyroid blocking during a nuclear accident. The use of SI for protection against RI may be recommended in cases of radiological or nuclear emergencies, moreover the administration of iodine for prophylactic purposes should be cautious. Benefits and risks should also be considered according to age. Adverse effects from iodine administration cannot be excluded. Precise indications are mandatory to use the iodine for thyroid blocking. Due to this natural adaption mechanism it’s possible to tolerate large doses of iodine without clinical effects, however, a prolonged assumption of the iodine when not needed can be dangerous and may precipitate in severe thyroidal and non-thyroidal negative effects. © © 2022 Calcaterra, Mameli, Rossi, Massini, Gambino, Baldassarre and Zuccotti.

AB  - Background: On May 3, 2016, residents of Fort McMurray Wood Buffalo, Alberta were evacuated due to an uncontrolled wildfire. The short-notice evacuation had destabilizing consequences for residents, including changes in routines, loss of control, and increased uncertainty. These consequences were especially detrimental to women who were pregnant or pre-conception during the evacuation. Pregnant and pre-conception women are particularly susceptible to a vast range of negative consequences during and post natural disasters, including elevated stress and higher incidence of pregnancy complications including gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy induced hypertension and C-section. The aim of this study was to understand the experiences, perceived stress and resilience of women who were pregnant during the wildfire. As well as to explore potential interventions to promote the health and enhance resilience of pregnant women and to assist in recovery after exposure to a natural disaster or other traumatic events. Methods: A qualitative thematic analysis of 16 narratives penned by pregnant women and recounted in Ashley Tobin's compilations 93/88,000 and 159 More/ 88,000: Stories of Evacuation, Re-Entry and the In-Between was conducted. Results: Analysis revealed five key themes: (1) experience of stress responses due to personal and external factors, (2) social connectedness and support as a facilitator of resilience, (3) performance of resilience-enhancing activities, (4) the roles of pregnancy and motherhood in the experiences of loss and resilience, and (5) the importance of home. Conclusion: Pregnant women have unique barriers that may negatively impact them during a natural disaster or other form of stressful event. They may benefit from assistance with navigating role transition during pregnancy, training in stress management strategies, and writing interventions to build resiliency and begin the process of recovery from trauma. © © 2022 Pike, Mikolas, Tompkins, Olson, Olson and Brémault-Phillips.

AB  - Objective: India reported its first case of coronavirus in Kerala on 30th January, 2020. On March 24, 2020, the Government of India announced the first complete lockdown of the entire nation for 21 days for the containment of the virus. The immediate effect of the lockdown was that the cases and COVID-19-related deaths were significantly controlled. Besides the direct effects, the indirect impact of the pandemic and pandemic-control policies on healthcare services, communities, and the global economy may also affect vulnerable groups like pregnant women. The objective is to explore trends in maternal or neonatal outcomes during this pandemic by comparing the same in pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic phases. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of maternal and neonatal outcomes over the period from January 2020 to August 2021. The monthly statistics from the pre-pandemic period (2018 and 2019) were combined and then analyzed against the statistics from 2020 and 2021 using the Fisher’s exact test or Chi-squared analysis as appropriate. Results: There was positive correlation between the monthly number of COVID-19-related deaths with the monthly number of stillbirths (p = 0.153). The diagnosis of antenatal complications such as hypertension in pregnancy occurred at the same rate pre-pandemic as in the months during the pandemic. There was a strong positive correlation between maternal mortality and the number of COVID-19-related deaths (p = 0.016). Conclusion: Women’s healthcare is often adversely affected in humanitarian disasters, and our study highlights the importance of planning for powerfully built maternal services in any emergency services. © The Author(s). 2022.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have shown that perinatal distress has a negative influence on pregnancy outcome and the physiological development of the baby. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal perinatal mental health in Spain. Methods: Seven hundred and twenty-four women (N = 450 pregnancy, N = 274 postpartum) were recruited online during the pandemic. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Satisfaction With Life Scale were administered. Variables related to sociodemographic information, the COVID-19 pandemic, and perinatal care were also assessed. Findings: The results showed that 58% of women reported depressive symptoms. Moreover, 51% of women reported anxiety symptoms. On the other hand, a regression analysis for life satisfaction showed that besides the perception about their own health, marital status or being a health practitioner were also significant predictors during pregnancy. However, perception about baby's health and sleep, perception about their own health, and marital status were significant predictors of life satisfaction during the postpartum stage. Discussion: Women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported high rates of psychological distress. Conclusion: These results highlight the need of clinical support during this period. Knowing the routes to both distress and well-being may help maternity services to effectively cope with the pandemic. © 2021 Australian College of Midwives

AB  - Maternal stress during pregnancy exerts long-term effects on the mental well-being of the offspring. However, the long-term effect of prenatal exposure on the offspring’s mental status is only partially understood. The placenta plays a vital role in connecting the maternal side to the fetus, thereby serving as an important interface between maternal exposure and fetal development. Here, we profiled the placental transcriptome of women who were pregnant during a hurricane (Superstorm Sandy), which struck New York City in 2012. The offspring were followed longitudinally and their temperament was assessed during the first 6–12 months of age. The data identified a significant correlation between a Superstorm Sandy stress factor score and infant temperament. Further, analysis of the placental transcriptomes identified an enrichment of functional pathways related to inflammation, extracellular matrix integrity and sensory perception in the specimen from those infants with “Slow-to-Warm-up” temperament during the first year of life. Together, these findings provide initial evidence that maternal exposure to climate-related disasters results in altered placental transcriptome, which may be related to long-term emotional and behavioral consequences in children. © © 2022 Buthmann, Huang, Casaccia, O’Neill, Nomura and Liu.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has increased risk of disturbances in the functioning of everyday life, directly or indirectly has influenced the risk of mental disorders in the most vulnerable populations, including pregnant women. The aim of this study was to analyze adverse mental health effects in the pregnant population during the COVID-19 pandemic, investigate risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes, identify protective factors, and create practical implications for clinical practice, bearing in mind the need to improve perinatal mental healthcare during such pandemics. Qualitative research was conducted in the electronic databases PubMed and Web of Sciences for the keywords COVID-19, pregnancy, depression, anxiety, and telemedicine for relevant critical articles (n = 3280) published from 2020 until October 2021, outlining the outcomes of control studies, meta-analysis, cross-sectional studies, face-to-face evaluation survey studies, remotely administered survey studies, and observational studies regarding the main topic; all were evaluated. Mental health problems among pregnant women linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, in most cases, show symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD and may cause adverse outcomes in pregnancy and fetus and newborn development, even at later stages of life. Therefore, useful implications for clinical practice for improving the adverse mental health outcomes of pregnant women associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are highly desirable. Our research findings support and advocate the need to modify the scope of healthcare provider practice in the event of a disaster, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be implemented and adopted by healthcare providers as useful implications for clinical practice. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Drought-induced tree mortality is predicted to increase in dry forests across the globe as future projections show hotter, drier climates. This could potentially result in large-scale tree die-offs, changes in species composition, and loss of forest ecosystem services, including carbon storage. While some studies have found that forest stands with greater basal areas (BA) have higher drought mortality, many have not evaluated the extent to which forests restored to lower densities via restoration activities affect drought mortality. The southwestern USA is particularly susceptible to tree mortality due to the predicted increases in temperature, drier soils, and forests with high density. Our objective was to evaluate how ponderosa pine mortality is expected to be influenced by the Four Forests Restoration Initiative (4FRI), a large-scale forest restoration effort ongoing in northern Arizona, USA, that will reduce stand BA by approximately 40%. Specifically, we modeled drought mortality in three time periods, one contemporary (1970–2010), and two future (2020–2059 and 2060–2099) under three restoration scenarios: no thinning, 4FRI thinning, and a BA reduction beyond the 4FRI plan (4FRI-intensive). We estimated mortality using 11 climate models under two emissions scenarios. Without thinning, our model predicted that by mid-century (2020–2059), changes in climate could increase annual ponderosa pine mortality rates by 45–57% over contemporary rates. However, with thinning, mid-century mortality was predicted to remain near or below contemporary rates and these rates are 31–35% (4FRI) and 46–51% (4FRI-intensive) less than the mid-century scenarios without thinning. Our study shows that while climate change is likely to increase tree mortality rates, large-scale forest restoration projects, such as 4FRI, have the potential to ameliorate the effects of climate change and keep mortality rates near contemporary levels for decades. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Children comprise approximately 22% of the population in the United States.1 In a widespread disaster such as a hurricane, pandemic, wildfire or major earthquake, children are at least proportionately affected to their share of the population, if not more so. They also have unique vulnerabilities including physical, mental, and developmental differences from adults, which make them more prone to adverse health effects of disasters.2-4 There are about 5000 pediatric critical care beds and 23 000 neonatal intensive care beds out of 900 000 total hospital beds in the United States.5 While no mechanism exists to consistently track pediatric acute care beds nationally (especially in real time), a previous study6 showed a 7% decline in pediatric medical-surgical beds between 2002 and 2011. This study also estimated there are about 30 000 acute care pediatric beds nationally. Finding appropriate hospital resources for the provision of care for pediatric disaster victims is an important concern for those charged with triaging patients in a major event. © © 2022 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - Background Breast-feeding holds considerable potential to reduce infant mortality. Feeding choices, already complex, take on additional complexity against a backdrop of the risk of transmissi-ble Ebola Virus. This review describes the factors that influence infant feeding and attitudes of pregnant women, mothers, family members and health practitioners, policy makers and providers (midwives) concerning infant feeding when there is a risk of Mother-to-Child (MTC) transmission of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Methodology A systematic review of qualitative studies identified through rigorous searches of thirteen online databases and additional citation searches of included studies was undertaken. Search terms included breast-feeding, breast-feeding, infant feeding; Ebola; and qualitative, interview(s) and findings. Independent extraction of data by two reviewers using predefined extraction forms. Studies were assessed using the CASP Qualitative checklist. Principal findings 5219 references were screened. 38 references related specifically to Ebola, and five papers met the inclusion criteria with data gathered from two settings: Guinea and Sierra Leone. The EVD outbreak had a significant impact on beliefs, attitudes, and resources to support infant feeding practices negatively affecting the nutritional status of children. The evidence from these studies highlight the need for guidance and appropriate psychosocial support need to be available to mothers who display symptoms and become infected and to front-line staff who are giving advice. Communities need to be engaged because stigma and fear may hinder uptake of appropriate interventions. The EVD outbreak caused multi-level system disruption akin to that seen following a natural disaster, meaning that logistics and coor-dination are critical and need adequate resourcing. Food production and distribution, and malnutrition screening are also disrupted and thereby compounding compromised nutritional status. The limited number of relevant studies highlights the need for further primary research, particularly in translation of messages to local settings. Conclusions An EVD outbreak causes multi-level disruption that negatively impacts infant feeding and child care practices. Negative impacts have multiple causes and successful planning for Ebola outbreaks requires that nutrition of infants and young children is a priority. Lessons from the Ebola pandemic have wider applicability to other pandemic contexts including Covid-19. © The Authors.

AB  - Background Maternal exposure to oil pollution is an important public health concern. However, there is a dearth of literature on the effects of maternal exposure to oil pollution on maternal outcomes in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. This study was therefore designed to determine the effect of maternal exposure to oil pollution on maternal outcomes in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Methods Prospective cohort study design involving 1720 pregnant women followed from pregnancy to delivery was conducted. The participants were 18-45 years old at a gestational age of less than 17 weeks, who attended randomly selected health facilities in the areas with high exposure and low exposure to oil pollution in the Niger Delta, Nigeria. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and review of medical records from April 2018 to April 2019. Multivariate log-binomial model was used to examine the effect of maternal exposure to oil pollution on the risk of adverse maternal outcomes adjusting for sociodemographic, maternal and lifestyle characteristics. Results A total of 1418 women completed the follow-up and were included in the analysis. Women in high exposure areas had a higher incidence of premature rupture of membrane (PROM), caesarean section (CS) and postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) compared to women in areas with low exposure to oil pollution. After adjusting for cofounders, women in high exposure areas also had a higher risk of PROM (ARR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.24-3.10) and PPH (ARR = 2.12; 95% CI: 1.28-3.36) in Model I-III when compared to women in areas with low exposure to oil pollution. However, pregnancy-induced hypertension and CS had no association with maternal exposure area status to oil pollution. Conclusion Women in high exposure areas are at a higher risk of PROM and PPH. This calls for policies and intervention toward reducing maternal exposure to oil pollution in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. © 2022 Oghenetega et al.

AB  - Preterm birth (PTB) complications are the leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age, responsible for approximately 1 million deaths in 2015, according to the World Health Organization. Those infants born prematurely who survived the first 5 years, studies suggest that these infants are more likely to experience a range of poor health outcomes during childhood and even adulthood. Wildfire smoke has been suggested as a type of air pollution source with high toxicity for reproductive health. In this study, we estimated the association between preterm birth and wildfire periods in Brazil, a country included in the list of the 10 nations with the greatest number of preterm birth and also considered as a very fire-prone region. We applied a time-stratified case-crossover study design using conditional logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratio for preterm birth associated with wildfire-related prenatal PM<inf>2.5</inf>, during different windows of exposure, including trimesters 1–3. After adjusting for several confounders (other air pollutants, demographics, meteorological variables, and spatiotemporal terms), we found that wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy may be associated with preterm birth in Brazil. Southeast was the region with the highest increase in the odds of PTB (OR:1.41 (95%CI: 1.31–1.51) when the exposure occurred in the first trimester. In the North, exposure to PM<inf>2.5</inf> during wildfire periods in the second trimester of pregnancy was associated with increased odds of PTB (OR:1.05 (95%CI: 1.01–1.09) in preterm birth when the exposure occurred in the second trimester. This study suggests that wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy may increase the risk for preterm birth in Brazil. This should be of great concern to the public health authorities, obstetricians, and policymakers. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether mindfulness-based childbirth and parenting (MBCP) or enhanced care as usual (ECAU) for expectant couples decreases fear of childbirth (FOC) and nonurgent obstetric interventions during labor and improves newborn outcomes. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Midwifery settings, the Netherlands, April 2014-July 2017. Population: Pregnant women with high FOC (n = 141) and partners. Methods: Allocation to MBCP or ECAU. Hierarchical multilevel and intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses. Main outcome measures: Primary: pre-/postintervention FOC, labor anxiety disorder, labor pain (catastrophizing and acceptance), and preferences for nonurgent obstetric interventions. Secondary: rates of epidural analgesia (EA), self-requested cesarean birth (sCB), unmedicated childbirth, and 1- and 5-minute newborn's Apgar scores. Results: MBCP was significantly superior to ECAU in decreasing FOC, catastrophizing of labor pain, preference for nonurgent obstetric interventions, and increasing acceptance of labor pain. MBCP participants were 36% less likely to undergo EA (RR 0.64, 95% CI [0.43-0.96]), 51% less likely to undergo sCB (RR 0.49, 95% CI [0.36-0.67]), and twice as likely to have unmedicated childbirth relative to ECAU (RR 2.00, 95% CI [1.23-3.20]). Newborn's 1-minute Apgar scores were higher in MBCP (DM −0.39, 95% CI [−0.74 to −0.03]). After correction for multiple testing, results remained significant in ITT and PP analyses, except EA in ITT analyses and 1-minute Apgar. Conclusions: MBCP for pregnant couples reduces mothers’ fear of childbirth, nonurgent obstetric interventions during childbirth and may improve childbirth outcomes. MBCP adapted for pregnant women with high FOC and their partners appears an acceptable and effective intervention for midwifery care. © 2021 The Authors. Birth published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Objective: This study continues former studies on perinatal mortality in Japan after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (FDNPP) accident in March 2011. An increased study region is chosen, and the study period is extended to 2019. Methods: Japanese monthly perinatal mortality data are provided on a prefecture level by the Japanese government. The study region consists of 12 prefectures around the FDNPP; the rest of Japan is used as the control region. A combined non-linear regression of perinatal mortality rates in the study- and control regions is conducted. The regression model allows for a common asymptotic lower limit of perinatal mortality, seasonal variations, and periodic peaks in 2012-2019 in the study region. To determine the dependency of the effect on distance from the FDNPP, the study region is divided into four core prefectures and eight prefectures surrounding the core prefectures. Results: Perinatal mortality rates in the study region show a significant 6.4% (95% CI: 1.8%, 13.4%) overall increase in 2012-2019 relative to the trend in preceding years with no attenuation during 2012-19. The increase translates to 590 (165, 1226) excess perinatal deaths (p = 0.016). It is characterized by annual peaks with maxima in April. A 13.6% increase is determined in the four core prefectures and a 4.3% increase in eight prefectures surrounding the core prefectures. Before 2012, there is a peak around April 2011 and a decline in October 2011; another significant peak is detected in November 2012. In the 4 core prefectures, large increases are found in the first quarter of 2018 (+70%) and in May 2019 (+130%). Conclusion: This study finds periodic peaks in perinatal mortality in spring 2012-2019 in 12 prefectures of Japan surrounding the FDNPP. In light of massive increases in 2018 and 2019 in the four core prefectures, continued investigation of perinatal mortality in contaminated regions of Japan is recommended.

AB  - Fetal growth is affected by exposure to both prenatal stress and environmental contaminants. The attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) resulted in exposure to chemicals and psychological stress amongst New York City residents. We measured prenatal maternal stress and exposure to persistent organic pollutants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, polychlorinated biphenyls, and poly-chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs)) in 108 participants from a Columbia University WTC birth cohort. Principal component (PC) analyses were conducted to characterize the mixture of exposure to the three groups of chemicals. We evaluated the associations between geographical exposures (proximity to the WTC disaster) and both chemical exposures (PCs) and stress (demoralization). We then evaluated the effect these exposures (PCs and stress) had on previously reported associations between geographical WTC exposure and birth outcomes (birth weight and birth length) in this study population to understand their individual roles in the observed associations. Geographical exposure via proximity to the WTC was associated with the PC reflecting higher PCDD exposure (PC3) (β = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.03, 1.18 for living/working within 2 miles of the WTC; and β = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.08, 1.38 for living within 2 miles of WTC). Previously reported reductions in birth weight and length associated with WTC proximity (β = −215.2, 95% CI: −416.2, −14.3 and β = −1.47, 95% CI: −2.6, −0.34, respectively) were attenuated and no longer significant for birth weight (β = −156.4, 95% CI: −358.2, 45.4) after adjusting for PC3, suggesting that PCDDs may act as partial mediators in this previously observed association. The results of this study can help focus future research on the long-term health effects of these prenatally exposed populations. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Objectives: Exposure to natural disasters during pregnancy is associated with adverse birth outcomes and increased probability of female births. Nonetheless, relatively little work has been done on evacuations of women living in close vicinity to volcanic eruptions. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among women from villages near the Sinabung volcano in North Sumatra, Indonesia, which has been active since 2010. Methods: We compared an “exposed” sample of women (n = 97) who were pregnant when forced to evacuate their villages due to the volcanic eruptions and an “unexposed” sample of non-evacuees (n = 97) matched for age and year of child's birth. We collected anthropometric data (height and weight of each woman) and conducted structured interviews about pregnancy outcomes and evacuation-related stress. Results: Evacuation led to an almost five-fold increase in the adjusted odds of having an early or preterm birth in non-imputed (OR = 4.84, 95% CI: 1.31–17.92) and multiply imputed (OR = 4.84, 95% CI: 1.29–19.19) analyses. It also led to approximately a 1 cm decrease in birth length in the non-imputed (β = −1.10, 95% CI: −1.96–0.24) and multiply imputed (β = −1.17, 95% CI: −1.20–0.36) analyses, both including controls for confounders. We found decreasing birth length with increasing stress among evacuees. There was no discernible effect of evacuation or stress on the other outcomes. Conclusions: Both adverse effects we documented can exert negative influences on later-in-life outcomes for children of women pregnant during evacuation. This should be considered when developing protocols for supporting women and connecting them with clinical resources when evacuated from natural disasters. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Using an exogenous measure of natural disasters based on physical intensities, I examine their impact on child mortality. I find that children, mostly, in poor countries are affected — a one standard deviation increase in the natural disaster index leads to an additional 6.77 deaths per 1000 live births in the disaster year. The impact is long lasting, extending beyond the disaster year. I provide suggestive evidence of the potential mechanisms driving these effects, namely, lower GDP and vaccination rates among children, along with an increased maternal mortality and disease incidence in low-income countries due to disasters. Using an endogenous measure of disasters based on damage records from insurance data leads to severe underestimation of the disaster impact. The results are robust to the use of mortality rates from multiple sources, different functional forms, and an extensive dynamic panel specification as well as various other tests. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Disaster risk is the potential loss expressed in lives, health status, livelihoods, assets, and services, which could occur in a particular community or a society due to the impact of a natural hazard. Disaster can lead to a loss in lives, livelihoods, and health and severely impact the economic, physical, social, cultural, and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities, and countries. All disasters are a health issue, impacting the health of the population and bringing about substantial losses and disruption to health systems. Disaster risk reduction (DRR) is essential for sustainable social and economic development. In 2015 the United Nations released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 2030 Agenda for SDGs recognizes and reaffirms the urgent need to reduce the risk of disasters. The Sendai Framework for DRR 2015–2030 highlights the concern on human health and well-being that are common to DRR, climate change, and sustainable development (Sendai Framework for DRR 2015–2030). Sendai Framework and SDGs are frequently interlinked. Health has a central place in SDG 3 among 17 goals. SDG 3 states to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Other SDGs such as education, food, water, sanitation, environmental gender discrimination, and abuse are social determinants of health that are also linked with health of people. With the additional knowledge and skills of epidemiology, and DRR, EpiNurse can play an important role to achieve these SDGs. Since EpiNurse seeks to help people to achieve optimum health, their work has a significant impact on SDGs. The Nepal Government has also set the targets and indicators for SDGs. The proposed SDG 3 targets include reduction of maternal mortality rate to less than 70 per 100 thousand live births, reduction of preventable death of newborn and children to less than one percent, and almost elimination of the prevalence of HIV, TB, malaria and other tropical diseases, and waterborne diseases by 2030. To achieve these targets of SDGs in Nepal, the role of EpiNurse nurses is crucial while disasters exist. EpiNurse refers to local nurses who perform epidemiological surveillance and care to ensure human health security and communicate with health authorities on the health status of communities during and after disasters. The aim of EpiNurse is to identify the potential health threats associated with different kinds of disasters in the community; and reduce such health risks as much as possible by using information and communication technology (ICT) based on the Sendai Framework for DRR. Participatory health assessment and monitoring, providing direct care, epidemiological surveillance and reporting, and communicating to authorities to ensure health security are the main roles of EpiNurse. The incorporation of ICT and epidemiological approach with nursing is an innovative approach. This approach can play an important role to meet the SDG targets. The aim of this article is to discuss the EpiNurse, emerging care, communication, and health monitoring during disasters. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

AB  - Introduction: Worster Drought syndrome (WDS) is a type of cerebral palsy that affects the muscles around the mouth and throat. This causes problems with swallowing, feeding, talking, and dribbling. Although the impairments are predominantly motor, a range of cognitive, behavioral, and seizures also exist. These features point towards the involvement of the perisylvian area of the cerebral cortex. Purpose of the Study: In WDS, the predominant impairment is a profound expressive communication problem and feeding difficulties; hence, it is under-recognized and even under-reported. Besides, these children have a specific phenotype which when recognized early can make a significant difference in management. This study aims to know the etiology and profile of WDS. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective cohort study in a tertiary care hospital from January 2018 to December 2019. All patients who met the absolute criterion for the diagnosis of WDS were included. A detailed history, clinical examination findings, relevant investigations like CT/MRI brain, and EEG were recorded in a predesigned proforma, and results were analyzed. Results: A total of 83 children (M:F = 52:31) presented within the age group of 2 years to 18 years. Seventy (84.33%) of them were delivered by a normal vaginal route. All children had global developmental delay, expressive speech delay, and spasticity. Other features were undernutrition 75(90%), drooling 66(79.51%), seizures 44(52.60%), and prolonged feeding 42(50.60%). Birth asphyxia was present in 72 (86.70%) cases, but neuroimaging was suggestive of perisylvian gliosis in 80 (96.38%) cases. Conclusions: WDS should be considered in children with cerebral palsy if mild motor delay with a predominant expressive language delay is present without hearing impairment and autistic features. In India, birth asphyxia is the most common cause. © 2021 Journal of Pediatric Neurosciences.

AB  - The Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) remains one of the backward provinces out of 34 provinces in Indonesia known for its high prevalence of undernutrition, poor access to sanitation, high poverty level, high infant mortality rate, and lack of physical infrastructure. Poor people face numerous shocks caused by climate variability that directly or indirectly affect their livelihoods and food security. This paper analyzes climate variability on food security dimensions using longitudinal panel data undertaking district-wise analysis. The study contributes to the existing literature on climate variability and food security undertaken four empirical models for an alternative comparison. Results revealed that climate variability influenced all components of food security variables. Food accessibility (i.e. income per capita) was the most affected by climate variables, followed by expenditure and household poverty. The maximum temperature greatly influenced food utilization (i.e. risk of diarrhea). Also, food availability such as paddy yield and livestock production was significantly affected by climate variability, followed by paddy and coffee production. In contrast, maize and coconut were less affected by climate variability. Results indicated that the province had experienced more extreme events recently with consequent natural disasters. Moreover, some increases and decreases in food production were also attributed to the local policy orientation. The findings of the study will be of immense benefit for policymaking. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Bangladesh has gained significant strides in economic development and social indicators, including poverty reduction and reduced infant mortality rate, instead of facing the havoc of the extreme climatic events, including seasonal flooding, cyclonic storm, and drought. This has been possible with the country’s leadership role in comprehensive planning and action for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction over the decades. Its success in adaptation to climatic risk has been praised in international forums, including the United Nations panel on climate change. The chapter will specify the details of historical actions and measures taken by the government and nongovernment sectors to cope with climate change and associated disasters in Bangladesh. Firstly, it briefly discusses the uncertainty, transformation, impacts, and adaptation features of Bangladesh against the effects of global greenhouse gas emissions or changing nature of climate. Later on, starting with the international context, it discusses disaster risk reduction and the adaptation context of the country. Then, to frame adaptation governance, it discusses the role of the individual, government, and stakeholders in capacity building. It also shows past and future investment scenarios to achieve the milestone of adaptation management at the national level. In addition, the chapter briefly discusses some successful cases and projects of adaptation practices in different sectors and various climate-vulnerable regions. It then describes existing plans, policies, and sectorial response and their integration into the national planning process to resist and adapt to climate change. Finally, it discusses the challenges and the way forward with closing remarks. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Backgrounds: For centuries, arboviruses have been spreading like a wildfire across the world, especially in developing countries like Nigeria with inadequate diagnostic and disease surveillance facilities, causing infinite death and suffering in human and animal populations. Therefore, this study aimed to discuss the impact of arboviruses on public health with a focus on Nigeria and West Africa. Materials & Methods: About 100 research articles were downloaded from online journal databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and African Journals OnLine (AJOL) with the following keywords: arboviruses, emerging, public health importance, Nigeria, and Africa. Findings: A total of 50 articles were used to write this review after a thorough screening. Arboviral infections caused by yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, West Nile, dengue, and chikungunya viruses were reported in Nigeria and discovered based on seroprevalence studies. Conclusion: Hemorrhagic fever, abortion, neonatal death, and decreased production in livestock are the most obvious features of arboviral infections; therefore, they are of public health and economic importance. Thus, there is a need to strengthen and refurbish the healthcare system in the country by employing preventive and control measures, vaccination campaigns, and other strategies to prevent the occurrence of diseases in the future. © 2022, TMU Press.

AB  - This research examined the seismic behavior of medical equipment, which supports advanced hospital functions through shaking table testing and numerical analysis, and derived evaluation index for mitigating damage. The shaking table test observed the rocking and overturning of neonatal beds and a dialysis liquid feeding apparatus under sine waves and the building floor responses during earthquakes. The rocking and overturning damage occurred only when the casters of equipment were all locked, and the ratio between the equipment’s gravity center height (h) and leg width (b), b/h, is smaller than a certain threshold. The influence of equipment dimensions and weight on the seismic behavior was studied by parametric analysis using a distinct element method (DEM) model of equipment. The probability of damage decreased significantly when the ratio between the b/h becomes large. For the floor velocity response of 80cm/s, which is assumed for the approximate return period of 500 years and with the response amplification factor (the ground to floor response ratio) of 1.6, the probability of overturning became negligible when the b/h is 0.4 or larger. This paper also presents an analytical equation to calculate sufficient safety weights added to existing equipment for conforming to the above thresholds of b/h. © 2022, Transactions of Japanese Society for Medical and Biological Engineering.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In April 2000, a series of wildfires occurred simultaneously in five adjacent small cities located on the eastern coast of Korea. These wildfires burned approximately 23,794 hectares of forestland over several days. We investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to the by-products generated by wildfire disasters on birth weight. METHODS: Birth weight data were obtained for 1999-2001 from the birth registration database of the Korean National Statistical Office and matched with the zip code and exposed/unexposed pregnancy week for days of the wildfires. Generalized linear models were then used to assess the associations between birth weight and exposure to wildfires after adjusting for fetal sex, gestational age, parity, maternal age, maternal education, paternal education, and average exposed atmospheric temperature. RESULTS: Compared with unexposed pregnancies before and after the wildfires, mean birth weight decreased by 41.4 g (95% confidence interval [CI], -72.4 to -10.4) after wildfire exposure during the first trimester, 23.2 g (95% CI, -59.3 to 13.0) for exposure during the second trimester, and 27.0 g (95% CI, -63.8 to 9.8) during the third trimester. In the adjusted model for infants exposed in utero during any trimester, the mean birth weight decreased by 32.5 g (95% CI, -53.2 to -11.7). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a 1% reduction in birth weight after wildfire exposure. Thus, exposure to by-products generated during a wildfire disaster during pregnancy may slow fetal growth and cause developmental delays. © 2022 Korean Society of Epidemiology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the most famous scientists in the United States. In particular, Tyson has expertise as an astrophysicist and hehas written several books and received extraordinary awards as an Astrophysician. Tyson is not only a scientist, he also recognizes himself as an agnostic. Tyson’s disbelief in the existence of God by seeing various event such as volcanoes, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, pestilences, and birth defects that produce suffering is totally against the Nature of Almighty God. Tyson considers God's intelligent Design as a philosophy of ignorance or neglect. The subject raised by Tyson that rejects God’s omnipotence and His Intelligent Design is categorized as a Problem of Evil. This article rejects Neil deGrasse Tyson's opinion built on God's teleological and theodicy philosophy as a form of defense of God's intelligent design and God's omnipotence. It is evident that a plan is needed for the existence of every creature by looking at integrated goals and structures. The beauty of the world also shows the existence of God's intelligent design as the Great Creator. Because the universe has been designed for the life of living things themselves, a plan is needed that is produced through a Person for the lives of the living things themselves. God's omnipotence means that God has no limits and He is able to do something that is impossible for anyone else who is limited through one’s nature and ability. Evil itself arises from humans who are God's creations, but they have free will. The very existence of Evil cannot detract from God's purpose in the creation of the universe. Evil itself requires the existence of an objective standard of goodness with a metaphysical foundation, namely God himself. Christianity cannot ignore the existence of evil itself. Crime is a reality. Crime itself is divided into three types: moral crime, physical crime and natural crime. Evil is in a sense very dependent on the existence of God who opposes evil. Evil cannot take away the Providence of God who has a wise, good and holy purpose. James has taught that there are different attitudes in the face of trials (James 1:2-18). Believers are encouraged to be diligent in facing trials that make one's personality mature and give one spiritual strength. People who believe Jesus Christ is God, have hope as the children of God to obtain certainty of the afterlife in the future based on striving for ideal conditions in their earthly human life. These notions support the existence of God's intelligent design and His Omnipotence. © 2023 Open Access/Author/s

AB  - Background: This study aimed to investigate the effects of maternal exposure to external radiation on perinatal outcomes among women who experienced the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster (FDND) using the Fukushima Health Management Survey (FHMS). Methods: Data from the Pregnancy and Birth Survey and Basic Survey in the FHMS were combined to analyze external maternal radiation exposure following the FDND, and the relationship between radiation dose and perinatal outcomes was analyzed using binomial logistic regression analysis. Missing dose data were supplemented using multiple imputation. Results: A total of 6,875 individuals responded to the survey. Congenital anomalies occurred in 2.9% of patients, low birth weight (LBW) in 7.6%, small for gestation age (SGA; <10th percentile) in 8.9%, and preterm birth in 4.1%. The median maternal external radiation dose was 0.5 mSv (maximum, 5.2 mSv). Doses were classified as follows: <1 mSv (reference), 1 to <2 mSv, and ≥2 mSv. For congenital anomalies, the crude odds ratio for 1 to <2 mSv was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56–1.17) (no participants with congenital anomaly were exposed to ≥2 mSv). At 1 to <2 mSv and ≥2 mSv, the respective adjusted odds ratios were 0.91 (95% CI, 0.71–1.18) and 1.21 (95% CI, 0.53–2.79) for LBW, 1.14 (95% CI, 0.92–1.42) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.30–2.37) for SGA, and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.65–1.29) and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.22–4.87) for preterm birth. Conclusion: External radiation dose due to the FDND was not associated with congenital anomalies, LBW, SGA, or preterm birth. © 2022 Shun Yasuda et al.

AB  - There are limited studies on the long-term effects of natural/environmental disasters, especially nuclear disasters, on obstetric outcomes. This study aimed to review the results of perinatal outcomes immediately after the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, as well as their long-term trends over 8 years, in the Fukushima Health Management Survey. The annual population-based Pregnancy and Birth Survey is conducted as part of the Fukushima Health Management Survey. The Fukushima Prefecture government launched it to assess the health conditions of pregnant women and their neonates after the GEJE. The self-reported questionnaire was sent to 115,976 pregnant women by mail from January 2012, with 58,344 women responding to the questionnaire (50.3% response rate). Pregnancy complications, such as gestational hypertension, respiratory diseases, and mental disorders, increased in some women who were pregnant at the time of the earthquake and immediately after the earthquake. However, the direct effects on newborns, such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and congenital anomalies, were not immediately clear after the earthquake. Although there were significant differences in the occurrence of preterm birth and low birth weight among the districts, there was no change in the occurrences of preterm birth, low birth weight, or anomalies in newborns in Fukushima Prefecture from the fiscal year 2011 to the fiscal year 2018. Therefore, the long-term effects of the post-disaster radiation accident on perinatal outcomes are considered to be very small. © 2022 Hyo Kyozuka et al.

AB  - The Fukushima Health Management Survey (FHMS) was established in response to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident on March 11, 2011. The primary objectives of the study are to monitor residents’ long-term health and promote their future well-being, and to determine the health effects of long-term low-dose radiation exposure. This special issue summarizes the results and current status of the FHMS and discusses the challenges and future directions of the FHMS. The FHMS, a cohort study of all people who were residents in Fukushima Prefecture at the time of the accident, consists of a Basic Survey, Thyroid Ultrasound Examination, Comprehensive Health Check, Mental Health and Lifestyle Survey, and Pregnancy and Birth Survey. The radiation exposure was estimated based on the behavioral records examined using the Basic Survey. Although the response rate was low in the Basic Survey, the representativeness of the radiation exposure data was confirmed using additional surveys. There appears to be no relationship between the radiation exposure and risk of thyroid cancer, although more thyroid cancer cases were detected than initially expected. The ongoing Comprehensive Health Check and Mental Health and Lifestyle Survey have provided evidence of worsening physical and mental health status. The Pregnancy and Birth Survey showed rates of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and congenital abnormalities similar to the national average. Considering the above evidence, the Fukushima Prefectural Government decided to end the Pregnancy and Birth Survey at the end of March 2021, as recommended by the Prefectural Oversight Committee. The framework of the FHMS has not changed, but the FHMS needs to adapt according to the survey results and the changing needs of the eligible residents and municipalities. © 2022 Seiji Yasumura et al.

AB  - With three-quarters of the 80 million people in need of humanitarian assistance being women or children in 2014, maternal care makes up a significant burden of medical care in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. Due to lack of infrastructure and up to 80% of these displaced people being located in developing countries, mothers are often extremely vulnerable to disease, abuse and malnutrition. This can lead to late presentations of severe disease and birthing complications that would usually be easily manageable, but are far more complex due to the physical condition of the mother and lack of available resources. The British Armed Forces are often involved in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief either intentionally or due to the nature of the operations they carry out. However, it is not always possible to predict the requirement of maternal care. This humanitarian special edition article focuses on the factors impacting the maternal patient in a humanitarian environment, also looking at common pathologies and ways of managing these in a Role 1 facility. This is a paper commissioned as a part of the Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Operations special issue of BMJ Military Health. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

AB  - Objective: To present the methodological aspects of the Brumadinho Health Project and to describe the epidemiological profile of participants in the baseline cohort. Methods: Prospective, population-based cohort study in a representative sample of residents (aged 12 and over) of Brumadinho, Minas Gerais, after a mining tailings dam failure. Information for the baseline was collected in 2021, two years after the mining tailings dam collapsed, including sociodemographic, health and service use aspects, among others. Prevalence estimates of health outcomes were described in Brumadinho, as well as in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte and Minas Gerais, using data from the 2019 National Health Survey. All analyses were performed in the software Stata 17.0, considering the sampling weights and design effect. Results: 3,080 (86.4%) residents participated in the study, most of them being females (56.7%) and with a mean age of 46.1 years. The diseases more frequently reported were arterial hypertension (30.1%), high cholesterol (23.1%) and depression (22.5%), similarly to what was observed in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte and Minas Gerais, although the prevalence in Brumadinho was higher. At least one medical appointment and one hospitalization occurred in 75.2% and 9.4% of residents in the past year, respectively. Conclusion: It is important to monitor health, physical and mental conditions of residents after the occurrence of a disaster of this magnitude. This information can contribute with risk management of these processes, not only in the affected municipality, but also in other areas where populations are at risk of major disasters. © 2022, Assocaicao Brasileira de Pos, Gradacao em Saude Coletiva.

AB  - Objective: To present the research protocol and to describe the preliminary results of the Bruminha Project. Methods: This project is part of the set of health actions proposed under the Brumadinho Health Project. It is a prospective cohort study with periodic follow-ups for four years. The eligible population was all children aged 0 to 6 years living in four rural communities of the affected municipality. Sociodemographic and health data were collected, as well as urinary samples, for assessment of exposure to metals. Results: In the first year of study, we evaluated 62% (217) of the eligible population and collected 172 (79%) valid urine samples. At least one metal was detected in all samples, and in 50.6% (n=87) or them, the metal concentration was higher than the reference value. In 38% (n=82) of the children, neuropsychomotor development was considered at risk. Report of respiratory allergy was four times (4.27) more frequent and of bronchitis 62% higher (1.62) in children living in locations exposed to dust from ore residues, compared to those living more than 10 km away from the site of the dam disaster. Conclusion: The study protocol was proven adequate to evaluate the proposed outcomes. The strategy used for population selection required adjustments regarding the long-term community awareness process, with new participants in the upcoming follow-ups (2022 and 2023). © 2022, Assocaicao Brasileira de Pos, Gradacao em Saude Coletiva.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the findings of the pregnancy and birth survey launched by the Fukushima prefectural government in 2011 following the Great East Japan Earthquake and the accident at Tokyo Electric Power Company’s (TEPCO’s) Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The survey was to assess the physical and mental health of pregnant women and mothers in the Fukushima prefecture after the disasters, address their anxiety, and provide necessary support. Over the past 7years, a questionnaire was sent to 102,425 pregnant women who received the Maternal and Child Health handbooks, and 50,996 of them responded. The response rate was relatively higher (58.2%) in the first year but has fluctuated around 50% since then. The incidences of stillbirth, preterm birth, low-birth-weight infants, and congenital anomalies were similar to those reported in the national surveys. Our analysis of the survey findings shows that the disaster had no significant adverse outcomes in the Fukushima prefecture. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Chronic lung disease (CLD) is a major neonatal pulmonary disorder associated with inflammation. Recent studies have shown that protein C anticoagulant pathways, such as those for protein C (PC), protein S (PS), and thrombomodulin (TM), could be useful indices for reflecting pulmonary injury. However, the involvement of these factors in preterm infants with very low birthweight (VLBW) who have developed CLD remains to be investigated. Here, we investigated whether PC pathway-related factors could predict the development of CLD in preterm infants with VLBW. Methods: We collected plasma samples from 26 preterm infants with VLBW (13 each from those with and without CLD) at the time of birth and measured TM, PC, and PS levels in their plasmas. We analyzed prospectively the relationship between these factors in infants with and without CLD. Results: There were significant differences in gestational age, birthweight, Apgar score (5 min), and duration of mechanical ventilation between the CLD and non-CLD groups. No significant differences in the PC and PS levels at birth were observed between the two groups, whereas the TM levels in the CLD group were significantly higher than those in the non-CLD group (P = 0.013). The TM levels correlated with gestational age and duration of mechanical ventilation. However, covariance analysis demonstrated that gestational age was significantly associated with TM levels, and consequently, development of CLD was not associated with TM level at birth.

AB  - Thalidomide is responsible for the biggest medical disaster in history, causing severe birth defects in more than 10, 000 children, globally, between 1957 and 1962. Understanding how thalidomide caused birth defects has remained a challenge for many years. Yet thalidomide is now used around the world to successfully treat a wide range of conditions, including leprosy, Crohn’s disease, multiple myeloma, and some cancers. Tragically, however, with its renewed use children are again being born with thalidomide-induced deformities, particularly in Brazil. Breakthroughs in the understanding of thalidomide’s teratogenic actions raise the possibility of producing analogs or synthesizing new forms of thalidomide that maintain the clinical benefits but without the teratogenic side effects. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic resulting from the emergence of the SARS- CoV-2 virus remains a serious global health problem. An analysis has been made of the available modern foreign and Russian literature on topical issues of the 2019 novel coronavirus infection during pregnancy. Despite the tsunami of published information, many issues remain disputable and controversial and require further study. To date, little is known about the impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus infection on pregnancy. This review considers the physiological changes during pregnancy, which make pregnant women vulnerable to contamination and severe infection, as well as the possibility of intrauterine transmission, lactation during COVID-19, and specific preventive measures. Conclusion: Understanding that pregnant women are a vulnerable population at high risk for severe COVID-19 infection is essential to improve obstetric care during a pandemic. Medical personnel should conduct educational conversations with pregnant women and/or puerperas about the importance of adhering to non-specific prevention and vaccination measures to reduce adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. © A group of authors, 2022.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The devastation of pharmaceutical production facilities from Hurricane Maria caused a national shortage of parenteral amino acids in October 2017. Our institution decreased trophamine in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants and initiated human milk fortification at a lower feeding volume to increase enteral protein intake more quickly. The objective of this study was to assess how protein management during the shortage period affected the incidence of malnutrition. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of infants admitted to 2 neonatal intensive care units from June 1, 2017 to May 31, 2018. Infants between 23 and 32 weeks’ gestation were included in this study. The primary outcome was the incidence of malnutrition at 14 days, defined as a z score decline of ≥0.8 SDs, in the pre-shortage period compared with the shortage period. Clinical data regarding adverse effects associated with early fortification and pharmacy costs were recorded. RESULTS There were 68 infants prior to and 65 during the shortage who met inclusion criteria. There was no difference in malnutrition between the pre-shortage and shortage groups; however, a significant increase in malnutrition was observed in infants who did not receive early fortification during the shortage. No difference in time to full enteral feeds or necrotizing enterocolitis was observed with early fortification. CONCLUSIONS Early fortification in VLBW infants receiving less trophamine during the shortage was not associated with an increase in malnutrition. Restricting trophamine in neonates during the shortage allowed for distribution to other critically ill patients.

AB  - Objective: Radiation exposure is known to be mutagenic and teratogenic. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of the increased ionizing radiation emitted by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on maternal and fetal outcomes in Hungary. Methods: A retrospective analysis of abortion, stillbirth, and congenital anomaly data for pregnancies in Hungary between 1 January 1981 and 31 December 1991 was conducted. Results: Trend analysis revealed increasing trends in spontaneous and voluntary abortion rates in Hungary during the study time period, while late pregnancy losses showed a decreasing trend. Overall, there were generally decreasing incidence rates for birth defects throughout the 1980s. Increased voluntary abortions over the study period might reflect, at least in part, maternal anxiety in the post-Chernobyl years. Decreased late pregnancy loss over the same period may be attributable to improvements in prenatal diagnostics. A notable weakness of this study is that missing data could not be complemented due to the decades that have passed since the incident. Conclusions: In conclusion, the present data suggest that the nuclear catastrophe in 1986 did not cause a significant increase in pregnancy loss or congenital malformations in Hungary. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Infectious diseases, chronic diseases, and mental disorders in both adults and children are reported after disasters occur. The correlation between chronic diseases and mental disorders has also been reported. Moreover, disasters may affect perinatal outcomes. Thus, both adult and child health should be carefully monitored in disaster aftermath. A prospective cohort study of pregnant women and their families, the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project (TMM) Birth and Three-Generation Cohort Study (TMM BirThree Cohort Study), has been conducted since 2013. A total of 73,529 family members participated in the TMM BirThree Cohort Study. Among siblings, the proportion of “small for gestational age” was the same in the pre-and post-disaster periods. Among parents and grandparents who answered the baseline questionnaire, 5.6% in the inland area and 19.8% in the coastal area had their houses totally/mostly destroyed by the Great East Japan Earthquake. Although a depression trend due to house damage was not observed in mothers, the proportion of psychological distress was high according to house damage (P for trend = 0.04). Among parents, there was an increase in overweight persons (P for trend = 0.004 in mothers and < 0.0001 in fathers) and in the number of smokers based on the severity of house damage (P for trend = 0.002 in mothers and < 0.0001 in fathers), whereas no such trend was observed in grandparents. Continuous monitoring and support for those who need are essential. Moreover, utilizing existing cohort studies to investigate health status when we face a new disaster is desirable. © 2022 Tohoku University Medical Press.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is the most important event in women’s lives and can lead to psychological lability. Several risk factors (such as disasters, events and pandemics) have been correlated with greater prevalence of mental disorders during pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: To research how pregnant women have been affected by the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic process, in order to contribute to the limited literature. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional survey study conducted at the Training and Research Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Ordu, Ordu, Turkey, from February 1 to March 1, 2021. METHODS: In total, 356 pregnant women were enrolled and completed the survey. Intention of going to hospital and the Beck anxiety, Beck depression, Beck hopelessness and Epworth sleepiness scales were applied to detect mental disorders. RESULTS: Among the participants, the anxiety, depression, hopelessness and sleepiness scores were 29.2%, 36.2%, 58.1% and 11.8%, respectively. The pregnant women stated that they avoided going to hospital in unnecessary situations by obeying the ‘stay at home’ calls, but also stated that they were afraid of the potential harmful effects of inadequate physician control. However, most of them stated that they would go to the hospital in emergencies. CONCLUSIONS: This paper illustrated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of pregnant women and emphasized their high rates of anxiety, depression, hopelessness and sleepiness. Since presence of mental disorders is indirectly related to poor pregnancy outcomes, preventive strategies should be developed, especially during this pandemic process. © 2021 by Associação Paulista de Medicina.

AB  - Recent evidence has shown an association between wildfire smoke and COVID-19 cases and deaths. The San Francisco Bay Area, in California (USA), experienced two major concurrent public health threats in 2020: the COVID-19 pandemic and dense smoke emitted by wildfires. This provides a unprecedented context to unravel the role of acute air pollution exposure on COVID-19 severity. A smoke product provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association Hazard Mapping System was used to identify counties exposed to heavy smoke in summer and fall of 2020. Daily COVID-19 cases and deaths for the United States were downloaded at the County-level from the CDC COVID Data Tracker. Synthetic control methods were used to estimate the causal effect of the wildfire smoke on daily COVID-19 case fatality ratios (CFRs), adjusting for population mobility. Evidence of an impact of wildfire smoke on COVID-19 CFRs was observed, with precise estimates in Alameda and San Francisco. Up to 58 (95% CI: 29, 87) additional deaths for every 1000 COVID-19 incident daily cases attributable to wildfire smoke was estimated in Alameda in early September. Findings indicated that extreme weather events such as wildfires smoke can drive increased vulnerability to infectious diseases, highlighting the need to further study these colliding crises. Understanding the environmental drivers of COVID-19 mortality can be used to protect vulnerable populations from these potentially concomitant public health threats. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Flood is one of the natural disasters with high prevalence in the world. The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of flood on pregnancy outcome and pregnancy complication such as preterm birth, LBW, SGA, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia and eclampsia. This is a systematic review based on the PRISMA model that examines pregnancy disorder, pregnancy complication, and reproductive outcomes in floods. For fulfilling of the objectives of the research, related keywords were identified using Mesh and Emtree databases. Then the search was done in the electronic database of Medline, Web of Science, Embase, scopus until 2021.2.10. The search strategy in the Medline database. Database searches resulted in 823 non-duplicate records. After reading the abstracts, 808 articles were excluded. 15 abstracts were eligible for the study, which their full texts were provided. Finally based on inclusion and exclusion criteria 7 articles were included in this study. After flood, the rate of LBW birth and gestational hypertension increases. However, there is no significant difference in preterm birth rates. Pregnancy complications can be reduced or prevented by starting prenatal care early and also by controlling risk factors such as reducing smoking and alcohol consumption. © 2021

AB  - Purpose: In March 2020, daily life was disrupted by the new virus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Pandemic-related prenatal anxiety could lead to depression, a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes and abnormal neonatal development. This study aimed to investigate the impact of anxiety on the mental health of pregnant women exposed to catastrophic events as compared to those without such exposure. Materials and methods: PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched for relevant studies. This study compared the prevalence of anxiety among pregnant women during a catastrophic event. Results: Fifteen full texts were assessed for inclusion, with 3 included, 10 excluded for not meeting criteria, and 2 excluded for other reasons. The included studies were published before the current COVID-19 pandemic but included the SARS 2003 outbreak. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, 10 further studies were conducted, but they failed to meet the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of two studies using STAI revealed that women exposed to a catastrophic event had a higher mean STAI score of 1.82 points (95% CI: 0.47–3.18 points). Conclusion: Women with complications during pregnancy should be assessed for anxiety independently from catastrophic events. During financial crises, environmental or other disasters, special attention should be given to women with low risk, normal pregnancies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - There is limited population-scale evidence on the burden of exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy and its impacts on birth outcomes. In order to investigate this relationship, data on every singleton birth in California 2006–2012 were combined with satellite-based estimates of wildfire smoke plume boundaries and high-resolution gridded estimates of surface PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations and a regression model was used to estimate associations with preterm birth risk. Results suggest that each additional day of exposure to any wildfire smoke during pregnancy was associated with an 0.49 % (95 % CI: 0.41–0.59 %) increase in risk of preterm birth (<37 weeks). At sample median smoke exposure (7 days) this translated to a 3.4 % increase in risk, relative to an unexposed mother. Estimates by trimester suggest stronger associations with exposure later in pregnancy and estimates by smoke intensity indicate that observed associations were driven by higher intensity smoke-days. Exposure to low intensity smoke-days had no association with preterm birth while an additional medium (smoke PM<inf>2.5</inf> 5–10 μg/m3) or high (smoke PM<inf>2.5</inf> > 10 μg/m3) intensity smoke-day was associated with an 0.95 % (95 % CI: 0.47–1.42 %) and 0.82 % (95 % CI: 0.41–1.24 %) increase in preterm risk, respectively. In contrast to previous findings for other pollution types, neither exposure to smoke nor the relative impact of smoke on preterm birth differed by race/ethnicity or income in our sample. However, impacts differed greatly by baseline smoke exposure, with mothers in regions with infrequent smoke exposure experiencing substantially larger impacts from an additional smoke-day than mothers in regions where smoke is more common. We estimate 6,974 (95 % CI: 5,513–8,437) excess preterm births attributable to wildfire smoke exposure 2007–2012, accounting for 3.7 % of observed preterm births during this period. Our findings have important implications for understanding the costs of growing wildfire smoke exposure, and for understanding the benefits of smoke mitigation measures. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: One of the biggest drug disasters in history has not prevented thalidomide from being used to treat various clinical conditions. Currently, Brazil has a worrying scenario: high consumption of the drug and, cases of pregnant women using thalidomide, even after adopting restrictive legislation. Areas covered: This review of the literature and legislation sought to comparatively analyze the monitoring of thalidomide use in Brazil and other countries that use this drug. Finally, we discuss the differences between the countries. Expert opinion: This analysis allows us to think beyond the safe use of thalidomide, but the safety provided by any type of monitoring system. It seems that out-patients that use unsafe drugs are exposed to some degree of risk. To improve safety, more extensive improvements are needed than monitoring systems related to the use of thalidomide. Its safe use depends on a drastic reduction in the incidence of leprosy and Erythema Nodosum Leprosum in the world; investment in research and development of safe and effective therapeutic alternatives to thalidomide; improvement of health systems and their health surveillance systems, particularly in primary health care; awareness of health professionals and patients for greater responsibility in the use of medicines, especially thalidomide. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We undertake a nationwide US study to estimate how mega-fires (defined as wildfires >100,000 acres in size) affect short-term infant health outcomes in communities located within the flame zone. This is the first study to look exclusively at mega-fires, which have unique characteristics compared to smaller wildfire events and are becoming more frequent in the US. We find that pregnant mothers in affected counties experience 0.8 percentage point greater instances of low birth weight and 1.2 percentage point greater instances of prematurity. The low birth weight finding is equivalent to what would be expected if a mother smoked approximately 6.2 cigarettes per day during pregnancy. Importantly, impacts are potentially non-linearly increasing in mega-fire size. Improved benefit-cost analyses are needed to account for mega-fire indirect impacts when making wildfire control and suppression decisions. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose of reviewTo evaluate the available literature regarding effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on newborns, ranging from effects related to in utero and perinatal exposure to maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, to pandemic-related stress and socioeconomic changes.Recent findingsSeveral large studies and national registries have shown that the risk of vertical transmission from SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers to newborns is rare and does not appear to be related to postnatal care policies such as mother-newborn separation and breastfeeding. Newborns exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in utero are at higher risk for preterm delivery for reasons still under investigation. When newborns do acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection, their disease course is usually mild. Long-term follow-up data are lacking, but preliminary reports indicate that, similarly to prior natural disasters, being born during the pandemic may be associated with developmental risk.SummaryAlthough risk of vertical or perinatal transmission is low across a range of postnatal care practices, early indicators suggest developmental risk to the generation born during the pandemic. Long-term follow-up data are critically needed to determine the developmental impact of in utero and early life exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Background: Evidence from previous studies suggests that women firefighters have greater risk of some adverse reproductive outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether women firefighters had greater risk of miscarriage compared to non-firefighters and whether there were occupational factors associated with risk of miscarriage among firefighters. Methods: We studied pregnancies in the United States fire service using data from the Health and Wellness of Women Firefighters Study (n = 3181). We compared the prevalence of miscarriage among firefighters to published rates among non-firefighters using age-standardized prevalence ratios. We used generalized estimating equations to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between occupational factors (employment (career/volunteer), wildland firefighter status (wildland or wildland-urban-interface/structural), shift schedule, fire/rescue calls at pregnancy start) and risk of miscarriage, adjusted for age at pregnancy, education, gravidity, BMI, and smoking. We evaluated if associations varied by age at pregnancy or employment. Results: Among 1074 firefighters and 1864 total pregnancies, 404 pregnancies resulted in miscarriages (22%). Among most recent pregnancies, 138 resulted in miscarriage (13%). Compared to a study of US nurses, firefighters had 2.33 times greater age-standardized prevalence of miscarriage (95% CI 1.96–2.75). Overall, we observed that volunteer firefighters had an increased risk of miscarriage which varied by wildland status (interaction p-value< 0.01). Among structural firefighters, volunteer firefighters had 1.42 times the risk of miscarriage (95% CI 1.11–1.80) compared to career firefighters. Among wildland/wildland-urban-interface firefighters, volunteer firefighters had 2.53 times the risk of miscarriage (95% CI 1.35–4.78) compared to career firefighters. Conclusions: Age-standardized miscarriage prevalence among firefighters may be greater than non-firefighters and there may be variation in risk of miscarriage by fire service role. Further research is needed to clarify these associations to inform policy and decision-making. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Pacific Island countries are vulnerable to disasters, including cyclones and earthquakes. Disaster preparedness is key to a well-coordinated response to preventing sexual violence and assisting survivors, reducing the transmission of HIV and other STIs, and preventing excess maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. This study aimed to identify the capacity development activities undertaken as part of the SPRINT program in Fiji and Tonga and how these enabled the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) response to Tropical Cyclones Winston and Gita. Methods: This descriptive qualitative study was informed by a framework designed to assess public health emergency response capacity across various levels (systems, organisational, and individual) and two phases of the disaster management cycle (preparedness and response). Eight key informants were recruited purposively to include diverse individuals from relevant organisations and interviewed by telephone, Zoom, Skype and email. Template analysis was used to examine the data. Findings: Differences in the country contexts were highlighted. The existing program of training in Tonga, investment from the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) Humanitarian Hub, the status of the Tonga Family Health Association as the key player in the delivery of SRH, together with its long experience of delivering contract work in short time-frames and strong relationship with the Ministry of Health (MoH) facilitated a relatively smooth and rapid response. In contrast, there had been limited capacity development work in Fiji prior to Winston, requiring training to be rapidly delivered during the immediate response to the cyclone with the support of surge staff from IPPF. In Fiji, the response was initially hampered by a lack of clarity concerning stakeholder roles and coordination, but linkages were quickly built to enable a response. Participants highlighted the importance of personal relationships, individuals’ and organisations' motivation to respond, and strong rapport with the community to deliver SRH. Discussion: This study highlights the need for comprehensive activities at multiple levels within a country and across the Pacific region to build capacity for a SRH response. While the SPRINT initiative has been implemented across several regions to improve organisational and national capacity preparedness, training for communities can be strengthened. This research outlines the importance of formalising partnerships and regular meetings and training to ensure the currency of coordination efforts in readiness for activation. However, work is needed to further institutionalise SRH in emergencies in national policy and accountability mechanisms. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Species responses to climate change depend on environment, genetics, and interactions among these factors. Intraspecific cytotype (ploidy level) variation is a common type of genetic variation in many species. However, the importance of intraspecific cytotype variation in determining demography across environments is poorly known. We studied quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), which occurs in diploid and triploid cytotypes. This widespread tree species is experiencing contractions in its western range, which could potentially be linked to cytotype-dependent drought tolerance. We found that interactions between cytotype and environment drive mortality and recruitment across 503 plots in Colorado. Triploids were more vulnerable to mortality relative to diploids and had reduced recruitment on more drought-prone and disturbed plots relative to diploids. Furthermore, there was substantial genotype-dependent variation in demography. Thus, cytotype and genotype variation are associated with decline in this foundation species. Future assessment of demographic responses to climate change will benefit from knowledge of how genetic and environmental mosaics interact to determine species’ ecophysiology and demography. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - To evaluate whether pregnancies conceived via assisted reproductive technology and exposed to Hurricane Katrina (HK), one of the most destructive natural disasters in United States history, were more prone to adverse perinatal outcomes, miscarriages, or sex disparities compared with pregnancies established but not directly exposed to the natural disaster. Retrospective cohort study. Women 18 years and older undergoing fresh ART cycles that resulted in singleton pregnancies and entered in the SART CORS database from 2004 to 2008. Incidence of full-term and preterm delivery, miscarriage rate, infant weight at birth, and infant sex ratio. Total follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation dosage and number of oocytes retrieved. Between January 2004 and December 2008, a total of 451,848 fresh autologous IVF cycles were recorded in SART CORS, leading to 190,624 pregnancies and 129,499 live births. After controlling for potential confounders, our results demonstrate no association between HK exposure and overall preterm deliveries (< 37 weeks) in women with singleton pregnancies conceived after ART. Other perinatal outcomes such as rate of spontaneous abortion or infant weight at birth in the exposed and unexposed groups were also not associated with HK. A comparison of pre and post disaster sex ratios revealed fewer males were born after HK (51.0% vs. 49.4%), showing a trend of decreased male infant births that was least in part associated with HK (CI 0.81–1.01; p = 0.07). Exposure to HK did not appear to affect perinatal outcomes such as the rate of preterm delivery or the rate of spontaneous abortion. Extreme stress may be a factor that contributes to a reduced male to female secondary sex ratio. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - At the beginning of 2020, the Italian Lombardy region was hit by an “epidemic tsunami” which was, at that point in time, one of the worst pandemics ever. At that moment the effects of SARS-COV 2 were still unknown. To evaluate whether the pandemic has influenced ART (Assisted Reproduction Techniques) outcomes in an asymptomatic infertile population treated at one of the major COVID-19 epicentres during the weeks immediately preceding lockdown. All ART procedures performed during two time periods were compared: November 1st, 2018 to February 28th, 2019 (non-COVID-19 risk) and November 1st, 2019 to February 29th, 2020 (COVID-19 risk). In total 1749 fresh cycles (883 non-COVID-19 risk and 866 COVID-19 risk) and1166 embryos and 63 oocytes warming cycles (538 and 37 during non-COVID and 628 and 26 during COVID-19 risk, respectively) were analysed. Clinical pregnancies per cycle were not different: 370 (25.38%) in non-COVID versus 415 (27.30%) (p = 0.237) during COVID-19 risk. There were no differences in biochemical pregnancy rates 52 (3.57%) versus 38 (2.50%) (p = 0.089) nor in ectopic pregnancies 4 (1.08%) versus 3 (0.72%) (p = 0.594), spontaneous miscarriages 84 (22.70%) versus 103 (24.82%) p = 0.487, nor in intrauterine ongoing pregnancies 282 (76.22%) versus 309 (74.46%) p = 0.569. A multivariate analysis investigating differences in spontaneous miscarriage rate showed no differences between the two timeframes. Our results support no differences in asymptomatic infertile couples’ ART outcomes between the pre COVID and COVID-19 periods in one of the earliest and most severe pandemic areas. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: On the 27th of March 2020 the Zimbabwean government declared the Covid-19 pandemic a ‘national disaster’. Travel restrictions and emergency regulations have had significant impacts on maternity services, including resource stock-outs, and closure of antenatal clinics during the lockdown period. Estimates of the indirect impact of Covid-19 on maternal and perinatal mortality was expected it to be considerable, but little data was yet available. This study aimed to examine the impact of Covid-19 and lockdown control measures on non-Covid outcomes in a government tertiary level maternity unit in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, by comparing maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality before, and after the lockdown was implemented. Methods: This was a retrospective, observational study, using a cross-sectional design to compare routine monthly maternal and perinatal statistics three months before and after Covid-19 emergency measures were implemented at Mpilo Central Hospital. Results: Between January-March and April-June 2020, the mean monthly deliveries reduced from 747.3 (SD ± 61.3) in the first quarter of 2020 to 681.0 (SD ± 17.6) during lockdown, but this was not statistically significant, p = 0.20. The Caesarean section rates fell from a mean of 29.8% (SD ± 1.7) versus 28.0% (SD ± 1.7), which was also not statistically significant, p = 0.18. During lockdown, the percentage of women delivering at Mpilo Central Hospital who were booked at the hospital fell from a mean of 41.6% (SD ± 1.1) to 35.8% (SD ± 4.3) which was statistically significant, p = 0.03. There was no significant change, however, in maternal mortality or severe maternal morbidity (such as post-partum haemorrhage (PPH), uterine rupture, and severe preeclampsia/eclampsia), stillbirth rate or special care baby unit admission. There was an increase in the mean total number of early neonatal deaths (ENND) (mean 18.7 (SD ± 2.9) versus 24.0 (SD ± 4.6), but this was not statistically significant, p = 0.32. Conclusions: Overall, maternity services at Mpilo showed resilience during the lockdown period, with no significant change in maternal and perinatal adverse outcomes, with the same number of man-hours worked before and during the lockdown Maternal and perinatal outcomes should continue to be monitored to assess the impact of Covid-19 and the lockdown measures as the pandemic in Zimbabwe unfolds. Further studies would be beneficial to explore women’s experiences and understand how bookings and deliveries at local clinics changed during this time. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Natural disasters (NDs) experienced by women and their children during prenatal and infant growth may have long-lasting effects on offspring’s development. Handgrip strength (HGS) is one of the measures of muscular strength and an indicator of health status. This study compared HGS in children exposed to cyclone Aila in India during their prenatal and infant growth compared to a control group from a non-affected, adjacent area. The total sample involved 444 boys and 423 girls aged 7–9 years, categorised into 3 groups: prenatally exposed to Aila, exposed to Aila in infancy, and the control group, non-exposed to Aila. Results revealed that prenatally exposed children of both sexes had significantly lower HGS than the controls (at least, p < 0.001 in boys; p < 0.05 in girls). On the other hand, the postnatally exposed boys, but not the girls, showed lower HGS than the controls. A significant effect of a group factor (ND exposure) on HGS was observed even after controlling for confounding variables (age, height, BMI, birth weight, gestational age; at least, p < 0.05). Our findings indicate that prenatal or early postnatal experience of a ND may have association with impaired HGS in prepubertal children. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: To examine changes in psychological distress prevalence among pregnant women in Miyagi Prefecture, which was directly affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, and compare it with the other, less damaged areas of Japan. Methods: This study was conducted in conjunction with the Japan Environment and Children`s Study. We examined 76,152 pregnant women including 8270 in Miyagi Regional Center and 67,882 in 13 other regional centers from the all-birth fixed data of the Japan Environment and Children’s Study. We then compared the prevalence and risk of distress in women in Miyagi Regional Center and women in the 13 regional centers for 3 years after the disaster. Results: Women in the Miyagi Regional Center suffered more psychological distress than those in the 13 regional centers: OR 1.38 (95% CI, 1.03–1.87) to 1.92 (95% CI, 1.42–2.60). Additionally, women in the inland area had a consistently higher prevalence of psychological distress compared to those from the 13 regional centers: OR 1.67 (95% CI, 1.18–2.38) to 2.19 (95% CI, 1.60–2.99). Conclusions: The lack of pre-disaster data in the Japan Environment and Children’s Study made it impossible to compare the incidence of psychological distress before and after the March 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. However, 3 years after the Great East Japan Earthquake, the prevalence of pregnant women with psychological distress did not improve in Miyagi Regional Center. Further, the prevalence of mental illness in inland areas was consistently higher than that in the 13 regional centers after the disaster. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - In mammalian species with prolonged maternal investment in which high-ranking males gain disproportionate numbers of mating opportunities, males that quickly ascend the hierarchy may benefit from eliminating the dependent offspring of their competitors. In savanna baboons, high-ranking females are the most profitable targets of infanticide or feticide, because their offspring have higher survival rates and their daughters reach sexual maturity at a younger age. However, such patterns may be obscured by environmental stressors that are known to exacerbate fetal losses, especially in lower-ranking females. Using 30 years of data on wild olive baboons (Papio anubis) in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, we found evidence that rapidly-rising immigrant males induced miscarriages in high-ranking females outside of drought conditions. However, miscarriage rates were largely reversed during prolonged periods of low rainfall, suggesting that low-ranking females are particularly vulnerable to low food availability and social instability. Infanticide did not emerge as a recurrent male strategy in this population, likely because of the protective behavior of resident males towards vulnerable juveniles. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Radiation from nuclear weapons or power plants has caused great concern among the public-concern that needs to be addressed with the best available data. Among the concerns associated with ionizing radiation are possible serious and far-reaching effects on reproductive health.Relevant data that can be used to address these concerns are scarce. The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings of World War II and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine are probably among the most dramatic and important sources of information on health effects, but much of the information is historical, and the exposed cohorts are getting old. In their accompanying article, Yamada et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2021;190(11):2323-2333) revisit data on reproductive health outcomes in survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings during the years after the blasts. Exposure levels were very high, but after Yamada et al.'s reanalysis, effect estimates were low, and the evidence for overall effects on birth defects and perinatal mortality is still weak. The authors acknowledge that their data have limitations and that the generalizability of the findings is limited by the devastating conditions that prevailed in the 2 Japanese cities after the blasts. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

AB  - Background: Maternal wildfire exposure (e.g., smoke, stress) has been associated with poor birth outcomes with effects potentially mediated through air pollution and psychosocial stress. Despite the recent hike in the intensity and frequency of wildfires in some regions of the world, a critical appraisal of the evidence on the association between maternal wildfire exposure and adverse birth outcomes has not yet been undertaken. We conducted a systematic review that evaluated the scientific evidence on the association between wildfire exposure during pregnancy and the risk of adverse birth outcomes. Methods: Comprehensive searches in nine bibliographic databases were conducted from database inception up to June 2020. Observational epidemiological studies that evaluated associations between exposure to wildfire during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes were eligible for inclusion. Studies were assessed using the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP OHAT) risk of bias tool and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Screening of retrieved articles, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Study results were synthesized descriptively. Results: Eight epidemiological studies conducted in four countries and involving 1,702,252 births were included in the review. The exposure to wildfire during pregnancy was assessed in individual studies by measurement of PM<inf>2.5</inf> (n = 2), PM<inf>10</inf> (n = 1), Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aerosol index (n = 1), heat spots (n = 1), and by proximity of maternal residence to wildfire-affected areas (n = 3). There is some evidence indicating that maternal wildfire exposure associates with birth weight reduction (n = 7) and preterm birth (n = 4), particularly when exposure to wildfire smoke occurred in late pregnancy. The association between wildfire exposure and small for gestational age (n = 2) and infant mortality (n = 1) was inconclusive. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that maternal exposure to wildfire during late pregnancy is linked to reduced birth weight and preterm birth. Well-designed comprehensive studies are needed to better understand the perinatal effects of wildfires. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Purpose: The quality and availability of sexual and reproductive health care are key determinants to reducing maternal mortalities and morbidities in disaster settings; yet, these services are often lacking in developing countries. Reducing maternal mortality and morbidity is currently the main targets of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3. The purpose of this study was to develop an intervention package called RHCC (Reproductive Health Kit 8; Capacity building; Community awareness), and to implement and evaluate it in three primary health-care (PHC) facilities in Belkuchi, Bangladesh, in order to improve the quality and availability of post-abortion care (PAC) during the 2017 floods. Design/methodology/approach: This research used both quantitative and qualitative methods to develop, implement and assess the RHCC in three flood-prone PHC facilities in Belkuchi. Findings: The RHCC was implemented during the floods of 2017. The findings pre- and post-intervention suggest it led to an increase in skilled management among health workers, an increase in the quality of care for clients and the availability of PAC at three PHC facilities during floods. Originality/value: Due to its geographic location, Bangladesh is exposed to recurrent floods and cyclones. Evidence-based integrated intervention packages, such as the RHCC, can improve the quality and availability of reproductive health care during disasters at PHC level and, in doing so, can promote the UN’s agenda on “disaster resilient health system” to achieve the SDG 3, and the WHO’s campaign on universal health coverage. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background AU Universal: Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly health coverage (UHC) encompasses 2 main components: : access to essential healthcare services and protection from financial hardship when using healthcare. This study examines Myanmar’s efforts to achieve UHC on a national and subnational level. It is a primer of studying the concept of UHC on a subnational level, and it also establishes a baseline for assessing future progress toward reaching UHC in Myanmar. Methods and findings The study uses the Demographic and Health Survey (2015) and the Myanmar Living Conditions Survey (MLCS; 2017) and adapts a previously developed UHC index to provide insights into the main barriers preventing the country’s progress toward UHC. We find a negative correlation between the UHC index and the state/region poverty levels. The equity of access analysis reveals significant pro-rich inequity in access to all essential healthcare services. Socioeconomic status and limited availability of healthcare infrastructure are the main driving forces behind the unequal access to interventions that are crucial to achieving UHC by 2030. Finally, financial risk protection analysis shows that the poor are less likely to use healthcare services, and, once they do, they are at a greater risk of suffering financial catastrophe. Limitations of this study revolve around its correlational, rather than causal, nature. Conclusions We suggest a 2-pronged approach to help Myanmar achieve UHC: Government and state authorities should reduce the financial burden of seeking healthcare, and, coupled with this, significant investment in and expansion of health infrastructure and the health workforce should be made, particularly in the poorer and more remote states. © 2021 Nikoloski et al.

AB  - The November 2018 Camp Fire, a devastating wildfire in Northern California, occurred during the peak of breeding season for field monkeys at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC). Effects of environmental stressors, such as wildfires, on birth outcomes in primates, and in humans, are poorly understood. Additionally, wildfires are of growing concern due to their increasing frequency and severity. The objective was to examine the impact of wildfire smoke on fertility, timing of birth, and pregnancy loss for field monkeys. A unique case-control study to investigate birth outcomes in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) was conducted at the CNPRC. All females in the study were maintained in outdoor fields during a period of elevated ambient wildfire smoke from November 8–22, 2018. In addition to ambient air quality evaluations, the effects on fertility, timing to birth, and pregnancy loss were documented. Archival records of approximately 5,000 conceptions from the previous nine years served as control data. During the Camp Fire, ambient fine particulate (PM <inf>2.5</inf>) levels exceeded the 24 -h National Ambient Air Quality Standard (35 μg/m 3) of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, reaching levels as high as 185 μg/m 3. A statistically significant association was observed between birth loss and the 2018–2019 CNPRC breeding season. As this wildfire event occurred during various stages of early pregnancy, an association can be inferred between early gestational exposure and increased risk of pregnancy loss. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - This study evaluates the long-run effects of early-life exposure to tropical cyclones on the socioeconomic performance of individuals in China. We identify significantly negative effects of gestational typhoon exposure on the educational attainment and annual income in adulthood, which also exhibit a significant gender inequality favoring the male. Despite the small culling effects from pregnancy failure and infant mortality, gestational typhoon exposures increase the probability of having a younger sibling and shorten the subsequent birth interval. Typhoon damage to the health and economic abilities of adults, as well as the local economy indicates a channel of household economic status for the reduced long-run socioeconomic outcomes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction Leptospirosis is a leading zoonotic disease worldwide with more than 1 million cases in the general population per year. With leptospirosis being an emerging infectious disease and as the world’s environment changes with more floods and environmental disasters, the burden of leptospirosis is expected to increase. The objectives of the systematic review were to explore how leptospirosis affects pregnancy, its burden in this population, its effects on maternal and fetal outcomes and the evidence base surrounding treatment options. Methods We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished literature using automated and manual methods to screen nine electronic databases since inception, with no language restriction. Two reviewers independently screened articles, completed the data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. Due to significant heterogeneity and paucity of data, we were unable to carry out a meta-analysis, but we conducted a pooled analysis of individual patient data from the case reports and case series to examine the patient and disease char-acteristics, diagnostic methods, differential diagnoses, antibiotic treatments, and outcomes of leptospirosis in pregnancy. The protocol for this review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO: CRD42020151501. Results We identified 419 records, of which we included eight observational studies, 21 case reports, three case series and identified four relevant ongoing studies. Overall the studies were with moderate bias and of ‘fair’ quality. We estimated the incidence of leptospirosis in pregnancy to be 1.3 per 10,000 in women presenting with fever or with jaundice, but this is likely to be higher in endemic areas. Adverse fetal outcomes were found to be more com-mon in pregnant patients who presented in the second trimester compared with patients who presented in the third trimester. There is overlap between how leptospirosis presents in pregnancy and in the general population. There is also overlap between the signs, symptoms and biochemical disturbances associated with leptospirosis in pregnancy and the presentation of pregnancy associated conditions, such as Pre-Eclampsia (PET), Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) and HELLP Syndrome (Haemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platelets). In 94% of identified cases with available data, there was an indicator in the patient history regarding exposure that could have helped include leptospirosis in the clinician’s differential diagnosis. We also identified a range of suitable antibiotic thera-pies for treating leptospirosis in pregnancy, most commonly used were penicillins. Conclusion This is the first systematic review of leptospirosis in pregnancy and it clearly shows the need to improve early diagnosis and treatment by asking early, treating early, and reporting well. Ask early—broaden differential diagnoses and ask early for potential leptospirosis expo-sures and risk factors. Treat early—increase index of suspicion in pregnant patients with fever in endemic areas and combine with rapid field diagnosis and early treatment. Report well—need for more good quality epidemiological studies on leptospirosis in pregnancy and better quality reporting of cases in literature. © 2021 Selvarajah et al.

AB  - Landscape fire smoke (LFS) has been associated with reduced birthweight, but evidence from low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) is rare. Here, we present a sibling-matched case– control study of 227,948 newborns to identify an association between fire-sourced fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and birthweight in 54 LMICs from 2000 to 2014. We selected mothers from the geocoded Demographic and Health Survey with at least two children and valid birthweight records. Newborns affiliated with the same mother were defined as a family group. Gestational exposure to LFS was assessed in each newborn using the concentration of fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf>. We determined the associations of the within-group variations in LFS exposure with birthweight differences between matched siblings using a fixed-effects regression model. Additionally, we analyzed the binary outcomes of low birthweight (LBW) or very low birthweight (VLBW). According to fully adjusted models, a 1 µg/m3 increase in the concentration of fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> was significantly associated with a 2.17 g (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56–3.77) reduction in birthweight, a 2.80% (95% CI: 0.97–4.66) increase in LBW risk, and an 11.68% (95% CI: 3.59–20.40) increase in VLBW risk. Our findings indicate that gestational exposure to LFS harms fetal health. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Armed conflicts have major indirect health impacts in addition to the direct harms from violence. They create enduring political instability, destabilise health systems, and foster negative socioeconomic and environmental conditions—all of which constrain efforts to reduce maternal and child mortality. The detrimental impacts of conflict on global maternal and child health are not robustly quantified. This study assesses the association between conflict and maternal and child health globally. Methods and findings Data for 181 countries (2000–2019) from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program and World Bank were analysed using panel regression models. Primary outcomes were maternal, under-5, infant, and neonatal mortality rates. Secondary outcomes were delivery by a skilled birth attendant and diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) and measles vaccination coverage. Models were adjusted for 10 confounders, country and year fixed effects, and conflict lagged by 1 year. Further lagged associations up to 10 years post-conflict were tested. The number of excess deaths due to conflict was estimated. Out of 3,718 country–year observations, 522 (14.0%) had minor conflicts and 148 (4.0%) had wars. In adjusted models, conflicts classified as wars were associated with an increase in maternal mortality of 36.9 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births (95% CI 1.9–72.0; 0.3 million excess deaths [95% CI 0.2 million–0.4 million] over the study period), an increase in infant mortality of 2.8 per 1,000 live births (95% CI 0.1–5.5; 2.0 million excess deaths [95% CI 1.6 million–2.5 million]), a decrease in DPT vaccination coverage of 4.9% (95% CI 1.5%–8.3%), and a decrease in measles vaccination coverage of 7.3% (95% CI 2.7%–11.8%). The long-term impacts of war were demonstrated by associated increases in maternal mortality observed for up to 7 years, in under-5 mortality for 3–5 years, in infant mortality for up to 8 years, in DPT vaccination coverage for up to 3 years, and in measles vaccination coverage for up to 2 years. No evidence of association between armed conflict and neonatal mortality or delivery by a skilled birth attendant was found. Study limitationsAU include: Pleasecheckthattheeditstothesentence the ecological study design, }Studylimita which may mask sub-national variation in conflict intensity, and the quality of the underlying data. Conclusions Our analysis indicates that armed conflict is associated with substantial and persistent excess maternal and child deaths globally, and with reductions in key measures that indicate reduced availability of organised healthcare. These findings highlight the importance of protecting women and children from the indirect harms of conflict, including those relating to health system deterioration and worsening socioeconomic conditions. © 2021 Jawad et al.

AB  - Background: Flooding following heavy rains precipitated by hurricanes has been shown to impact the health of people. Earth observations can be used to identify inundation extents for subsequent analysis of health risks associated with flooding at a fine spatio-temporal scale. Objective: To evaluate emergency department (ED) visits before, during, and following flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 in Texas. Methods: A controlled before and after design was employed using 2016–2018 ED visits from flooded and non-flooded census tracts. ED visits between landfall of the hurricane and receding of flood waters were considered within the flood period and post-flood periods extending up to 4 months were also evaluated. Modified Poisson regression models were used to estimate adjusted rate ratios for total and cause specific ED visits. Results: Flooding was associated with increased ED visits for carbon monoxide poisoning, insect bite, dehydration, hypothermia, intestinal infectious diseases, and pregnancy complications. During the month following the flood period, the risk for pregnancy complications and insect bite was still elevated in the flooded tracts. Significance: Earth observations coupled with ED visits increase our understanding of the short-term health risks during and following flooding, which can be used to inform preparedness measures to mitigate adverse health outcomes and identify localities with increased health risks during and following flooding events. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

AB  - Objective: To identify the major health problems of the Middle Ages. Bubonic plague is often considered the greatest health disaster in medieval history, but this has never been systematically investigated. Materials: We triangulate upon the problem using (i) modern WHO data on disease in the modern developing world, (ii) historical evidence for England such as post-medieval Bills of Mortality, and (iii) prevalences derived from original and published palaeopathological studies. Methods: Systematic analysis of the consequences of these health conditions using Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) according to the Global Burden of Disease methodology. Results: Infant and child death due to varied causes had the greatest impact upon population and health, followed by a range of chronic/infectious diseases, with tuberculosis probably being the next most significant one. Conclusions: Among medieval health problems, we estimate that plague was probably 7th–10th in overall importance. Although lethal and disruptive, it struck only periodically and had less cumulative long-term human consequences than chronically endemic conditions (e.g. bacterial and viral infections causing infant and child death, tuberculosis, and other pathogens). Significance: In contrast to modern health regimes, medieval health was above all an ecological struggle against a diverse host of infectious pathogens; social inequality was probably also an important contributing factor. Limitations: Methodological assumptions and use of proxy data mean that only approximate modelling of prevalences is possible. Suggestions for further research: Progress in understanding medieval health really depends upon understanding ancient infectious disease through further development of biomolecular methods. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Prenatal insult exposure effects on the offspring, have and are still considered the main interest of most teratological studies, while paternal and maternal preconception effects have received relatively little interest. Once thought to be a myth, paternal exposure to insults leading to numerous detrimental effects in the offspring, has been confirmed on several occasions and is gaining increased attention. These effects could be demonstrated molecularly, biochemically and/or behaviorally. Different epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed for these effects to occur, including DNA methylation, histone modification and sperm RNA transmission. Paternal insult exposure has been shown to cause several neurobehavioral and developmental defects in the offspring. Findings on parental insult exposure effects on the progeny will be discussed in this review, with the main focus being on neurobehavioral effects after parental preconceptional exposure. The exposure to the insults induced long-lasting, mostly marked, defects. A few pioneering, prevention and reversal studies were published. Interestingly, most studies were conducted on paternal exposure and, at the present state of this field, on animal models. Clinical translation remains the subsequent challenge. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Birth weight is an important determinant of pregnancy outcome and neonatal and infant survival. Pregnancies associated with foetal growth abnormalities of IUGR and macrosomia are high-risk pregnancies. This chapter defines, discusses, and teaches the etiopathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, and proffers treatment and management options for the causes of foetal growth abnormalities especially noting that these abnormalities are more commonly found in developing countries with limited resources, equipment and personnel. Cautionary tales of real-life examples of foetal growth abnormality diagnoses and their management outcomes are also featured to help the reader know the practical presentation of these cases and how inappropriate management may result in disaster. The specialist obstetrician, family physician, health professionals and students who care for pregnant women will be kept abreast with the various pathologies that could lead to IUGR, macrosomic and LGA babies and their management by studying this chapter. The healthcare provider and student will know how to prevent, investigate, diagnose and treat the pathologies that result in disproportionate foetal growth in settings with standard diagnostic and therapeutic tools as well as in under-resourced settings. The prognosis of IUGR, LGA and macrosomia for the mother, foetus, newborn and when to deliver are discussed in some detail. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that endocrine disruptors (EDs) can promote the transgenerational inheritance of disease susceptibility. Among the many existing EDs, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlordibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) affects reproductive health, including in humans, following direct occupational exposure or environmental disasters, for instance the Agent Orange sprayed during the Vietnam War. Conversely, few studies have focused on TCDD multigenerational and transgenerational effects on human reproductive health, despite the high amount of evidence in animal models of such effects on male and female reproductive health that mimic human reproductive system disorders. Importantly, these studies show that paternal ancestral TCDD exposure substantially contributes to pregnancy outcome and fetal health, although pregnancy outcome is considered tightly related to the woman’s health. In this work, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and a knowledge synthesis in order (i) to describe the findings obtained in rodent models concerning TCDD transgenerational effects on reproductive health and (ii) to discuss the epigenetic molecular alterations that might be involved in this process. As ancestral toxicant exposure cannot be changed in humans, identifying the crucial reproductive functions that are negatively affected by such exposure may help clinicians to preserve male and female fertility and to avoid adverse pregnancy outcomes. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - The complications of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and its COVID-19 disease on mothers and their offspring are less known. This review aimed to determine the transmission, severity, and complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. This review showed the influence of COVID-19 disease on neonatal neurogenesis. Owing medicines that were reported for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, this review suggested some control strategies like treatments (medici-nal plants, antiviral therapy, cellular therapy, and immunotherapy), nutrition uptake, prevention, and recommendations. This overview showed that severe infection of SARS-CoV-2 during the early stage of pregnancy might increase the risk of stress, panic, and anxiety. This disorder can disturb the maternal immune system, and thus causing a neurodevelopmental disturbance. This hypothesis may be depending on the severity and intensity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. However, vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from dams to their fetuses is absent until now. During this global pandemic disease, maintaining safety during pregnancy, vaginal delivery, and breastfeeding may play a vital role in a healthy life for the offspring. Thus, international, and natio-nal organizations should be continuing for perinatal management, particularly during the next pandemic or disaster time. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread world-wide, causing a significant public health disaster. Objectives: The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical features and laboratory data of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted from March 20 to September 5, 2020, on all neonates born to mothers with positive real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 or clinically suspected COVID-19. Neonates enrolled in this study were from five different hospitals affiliated with the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. All the newborns were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs during the first 24-48 hours of life, and a second-time swabbing was performed as indicated at subsequent visits. All categorical data were manifested as frequency (%), and continuous data were shown as mean ± SD. Results: Forty-four neonates born to 39 infected mothers were evaluated during the study period. Nineteen women had complications during pregnancy, including hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, preterm labor, etc. Besides, 54.5% of the neonates were born preterm. The mean gestational age and birth weight were 35.11 ± 4.01 weeks and 2,567 ± 898 g, respectively. Fifteen (34.1%) neonates were symptomatic at birth, and during the observation, more neonates became symptomatic. Finally, 27/44 (61.3%) neonates became symptomatic, and 17/44 remained asymptomatic. The most common clinical manifestations were respiratory distress (77.7%), followed by fever or hypothermia (18.5%), gastrointestinal problems (14.8%), and neurologic findings (3.7%). Also, the most common clinical feature of eight neonates with positive RT-PCR was respiratory distress, followed by neurologic symptoms, temperature instability, and gastrointestinal disorder, in sequence. Few abnormalities were seen in laboratory findings. Chest X-rays were abnormal in 22.2% of the neonates. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy may cause severe maternal and neonatal morbidities. Neonates with positive SARS-CoV-2 may demonstrate a spectrum of clinical features. The most common feature of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 was respiratory distress. © 2021, Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: The vast advancement of technology and breakthrough in high-tech disciplines created multiple areas of research activities, including the emergence of the medical drone. Malaysia, a rapidly developing country in Southeast Asia is on track to achieving high-income status. However, the stagnant growth of Malaysian maternal healthcare does not run parallel with the aspiration. This review paper assessed and reported narratively the current condition of maternal healthcare in Malaysia, the possible application of drones in improving the sector, exploring in detail several challenges, and providing recommendations for experts in studying the rising technological phenomena. Materials and Methods: A literature search was done from June 2019 to November 2019 with restrictions to the English language. The search was performed in ScienceDirect, PubMed, and EMBASE databases, using a combination of search terms related to drones, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), maternal, obstetric, healthcare, medical products transportation and Malaysia. A discourse analysis followed and a narrative review was provided on this subject. Results and Discussion: The validated ability of drones in the delivery of blood products is highlighted as a possible application in improving maternal healthcare in Malaysia, particularly in the state of Sabah. Five key challenges are identified: infrastructure, technicalities, regulations, expertise, and social acceptance. Future predictions of drone technology in healthcare were outlined with the suggestion of three principle arms of application. Conclusion: The usage of the medical drone in medical products transportation supports the objectives of WHO MDG 5 for Malaysian maternal health. A study on the impact of drones in reducing the maternal mortality ratio is recommended for further exploration. © 2021, Malaysian Society of Pathologists. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The chemical, physical, economic, and social effects of a major oil spill might adversely affect pregnancy health. Objectives: To examine the relationship between oil spill exposure and birth outcomes in a cohort of women living near the Gulf of Mexico at the time of the 2010 oil spill. Methods: Between 2012 and 2016, 1375 women reported their exposure to the oil spill, and at least one livebirth. Five hundred and three had births both before and after the oil spill. Indicators of oil spill exposure included self-reported financial consequences, direct contact with oil, traumatic experiences, loss of use of the coast, and involvement in litigation. Birth outcomes were low birthweight (LBW; birthweight <2500 g) and preterm birth (PTB; >3 weeks early). Women who were not pregnant at the time of the interview (n = 1001) self-reported outcomes, while women who were pregnant (n = 374) primarily had them abstracted from medical records (n = 374). All pregnancies prior to the oil spill were considered unexposed; those after the oil spill were considered exposed or unexposed depending on interview responses. Generalized estimating equations were used to control for clustering within women, with control for confounders. Results: The most common type of exposure was economic (49%), but 302 women (22.0%) reported some degree of direct contact with the oil. Associations between most indicators of oil spill exposure and pregnancy outcomes were null, although when all pregnancies were examined, associations were seen with high levels of contact with oil for LBW (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 2.19, 95% CI, 1.29–3.71) and PTB (aOR 2.27, 1.34–3.87). Discussion: In this community-based cohort, we did not find associations between report of exposure to the oil spill, with the possible exception of high oil contact in some analyses, and birth outcomes. Research incorporating specific biomarkers of oil spill exposure and stress biomarkers would be valuable, to allow for assessing both perceived and actual exposure, especially when direct toxicant exposure is minimal. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Background The World Health Organization encourages countries to improve birth outcomes to reduce rates of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Purpose This study was designed to examine the effect of environmental crude oil pollution on newborn birth outcomes in Rivers State, Nigeria. Methods A retrospective cohort design was used to examine the effects of exposure to oil pollution on birth outcomes using facility-based records. K-Dere (an oil-polluted community) served as the exposure group, whereas birth records from Iriebe served as the comparison group. A sample size of 338 systematically selected birth records was examined (169 records for each arm of the study). A data extraction sheet was used for data collection. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics at p <.05. Results The risk of preterm birth was significantly higher in the exposed group (16% vs. 7.7%, relative risk = 2.08, 95% CI [1.11, 3.89], p =.018). At 6 weeks after birth, newborns in the exposed group weighed significantly less (4.64 ± 0.82 vs. 4.85 ± 0.92 kg, p =.032) and reported significantly higher incidence of morbidity compared with the newborns in the comparison group (relative risk = 3.03, 95% CI [2.20, 4.19], p <.001). Conclusions The oil-polluted area examined in this study was found to have a higher risk of preterm birth, a slower rate of newborn growth, and a higher rate of newborn morbidity than the non-oil-polluted area at 6 weeks after birth. Stakeholders should sustain efforts to remediate the environment in polluted regions and prevent oil pollution. Future research should investigate the mechanisms of the observed toxicological effects and the targeted protection of vulnerable groups in oil-polluted communities. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Broad-scale forest restoration projects are implemented across the western United States to restore seasonally dry, frequent-fire-adapted ecosystems to improve ecological function and enhance resilience by increasing resistance to crown fire and climatic stressors. Despite the widespread use of restoration treatments that center on tree thinning and application of prescribed fire, the longevity of beneficial effects and the robustness of outcomes under future climate change predictions remains unclear. In this study, we remeasured a set of experimental areas established a minimum of 20 years ago that comprise a network of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest restoration study sites in northern Arizona. We analyzed ecological resiliency by evaluating forest conditions in terms of resistance to climatic stressors and potential crown fire in units that were thinned following evidence-based restoration guidelines (ERG), then burned with prescribed fire at multiple intervals, compared against paired untreated controls. Resilience indicators included forest structure, tree mortality, tree growth, regeneration, canopy fuels, and crowning index. We also simulated future forest conditions under a warming climate scenario (RCP 4.5) with a range of prescribed fire return intervals. Results indicated that experimental areas where restoration treatments were implemented remained more resilient to climate stressors compared to controls after 20 years. Treated areas had significantly lower tree mortality and greater average diameter growth compared to controls. Furthermore, forest structure generally remained similar to historical reference conditions in treated units with the exception of increases in ingrowth of sprouting species at the drier sites. Canopy fuel load and crown fire hazard in treated units remained significantly lower than controls, indicating that treatments remained effective in reducing crown fire potential over the 20-year study period without the need for additional tree thinning. Modeling basal area, crowning index, and the proportion of basal area in large trees under a future warming scenario suggested that the treated units underwent less changed than untreated areas. Under climate change, management of fire regimes even at longer-than-historical intervals (historical ≈ 5 yr, tested 5, 10, and 20 yr) would maintain basal area within our historical range of variability and maintain fire resistant forest over the next several decades. However, decline by the end of the century is concerning. Our results suggest that forest restoration treatments, guided by historical reference conditions, promote ecological resilience in the long-term and continued maintenance burning into the future is likely warranted even with continued drought and warming. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Long-term fire exclusion may weaken ecosystem resistance to the return of fire. We investigated how a surface wildfire that occurred after several decades of fire exclusion affected a southern Appalachian forest transitioning from a fire-adapted to a fire-intolerant state. Tree traits associated with fire adaptation often co-occur with traits for nutrient conservation, including the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) association. In the absence of fire, the ECM association may facilitate the accumulation of organic matter, which becomes colonized by fine roots that then become vulnerable to consumption or damage by fire. Therefore, a deeper organic horizon might make stands of fire-adapted, ECM trees less resistant to a surface wildfire than stands of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM), fire-intolerant trees. To test this hypothesis, we established plots in stands that fall along a gradient of mycorrhizal tree relative abundance both inside and outside the perimeter of the 2016 Rock Mountain wildfire. With increasing relative abundance of ECM trees, we found increasing organic horizon depth and mass and slower rates of decay, even for litter of ECM tree species. We calculated a major (73–83%) reduction in fine root biomass and length in the organic horizon following the wildfire. Over three years post-fire, we observed a higher probability of crown decline, basal sprouting and aboveground biomass mortality with increasing abundance of ECM trees. We propose that the biogeochemistry of mycorrhizal associations can help explain why fire exclusion makes stands of fire-adapted trees less resistant to a surface wildfire than those with fire-intolerant trees. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The evacuation of hospitals has special complications and sensitivities in terms of the presence of patients. Since infants are the youngest and most vulnerable patients in the hospital, the readiness of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to respond appropriately and evacuate at the time of disasters is very important. This article examines the emergency evacuation of neonatal intensive care units during disasters. The present systematic review was done based on the PRISMA guidelines for systematic review studies. Accordingly, all English-language articles published in this field were extracted by the end of January 2020, through searching Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct, as well as Google Scholar Web Search. The search and screen of the articles were conducted independently by the research team members, and the content of included articles was analyzed thematically. After the final evaluation, 11 articles were subjected to content analysis, which was divided into seven thematic categories: command, training and maneuver, manpower, communication, equipment, transportation, support. Considering that infants are the most vulnerable preparing the staff of the (NICU) along with providing them with specialized and technical support is suggested. By preparing and implementing response and preparedness plans, it is possible to prevent high complications and mortality among infants admitted to the hospital pre-disasters. © 2021 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Due to climate change, bushfires are becoming a more frequent and more severe phenomenon which contributes to poor health effects associated with air pollution. In pregnancy, environmental exposures can have lifelong consequences for the fetus, but little is known about these consequences in the context of bushfire smoke exposure. In this review we summarise the current knowledge in this area, and propose a potential mechanism linking bushfire smoke exposure in utero to poor perinatal and respiratory outcomes in the offspring. Bushfire smoke exposure is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes including reduced birth weight and an increased risk of prematurity. Some publications have outlined the adverse health effects on young children, particularly in relation to emergency department presentations and hospital admissions for respiratory problems, but there are no studies in children who were exposed to bushfire smoke in utero. Prenatal stress is likely to occur as a result of catastrophic bushfire events, and stress is known to be associated with poor perinatal and respiratory outcomes. Changes to DNA methylation are potential epigenetic mechanisms linking both smoke particulate exposure and prenatal stress to poor childhood respiratory health outcomes. More research is needed in large pregnancy cohorts exposed to bushfire events to explore this further, and to design appropriate mitigation interventions, in this area of global public health importance. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Following the accident at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, Fukushima Prefecture is conducting the Fukushima Health Management Survey, which has been contracted out to Fukushima Medical University. The purpose of this survey is to investigate the exposure doses and health conditions of the residents of Fukushima Prefecture in order to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases at an early stage, and to maintain and improve the health of residents in the future. This survey consists of a basic survey to estimate external exposure doses and detailed surveys to investigate health conditions. The detailed surveys comprise: (i) thyroid ultrasound examination; (ii) comprehensive health check; (iii) mental health and lifestyle survey; and (iv) pregnancy and birth survey. In the basic survey, the external exposure dose was estimated for >466,000 people during the first 4 months after the accident; it was estimated to be <5 mSv for 99.8% of residents. The thyroid ultrasound examination included four rounds of echo examinations covering approximately 380,000 children aged <18 years at the time of the accident in each round. The first, second, third, and fourth examinations identified 116, 71, 31, and 21 children with thyroid cancer/suspected cancer, respectively. The Fukushima Prefectural Oversight Committee analysed the results from the first and second examinations, and evaluated that ‘the detected increased rate is unlikely to be the impact of radiation’. However, the Oversight Committee is deliberating the future direction of thyroid examination, taking into consideration the advantages and disadvantages of the examination as well as ethical viewpoints. In the comprehensive health check, approximately 210,000 people in the evacuation area were examined, and increased rates of lifestyle-related diseases [e.g. obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia (low high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol)] were confirmed. In the mental health and lifestyle survey, approximately 210,000 people, including residents in the evacuation area, were examined. A deterioration in general mental health was found for the period immediately after the accident across a wide range of age groups, and although recovery was seen over the years, the rate of mental health issues remains above the national average. The pregnancy and birth survey revealed that the pre-term birth rate, low-birthweight rate, and rate of congenital anomalies did not differ from the national average. The purpose of Fukushima Health Management Survey is not only to collect data on the health of the residents of Fukushima Prefecture, but to provide direct support to residents regarding the health issues clarified by the survey. Moreover, various initiatives are being implemented in cooperation with various local government authorities with the aim of maintaining and promoting the health of the residents. © 2021, International Commission of Radiological Protection.

AB  - Objectives: Our aim is to understand the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on families who have been followed longitudinally in two cohorts studied in Alberta, Canada. We will examine household infections during the COVID-19 pandemic, financial impact, domestic violence, substance use, child school and daily life and relationships in the home. We will identify risk and protective factors for maternal mental health outcomes using longitudinal data that can inform policy and government resource allocation in future disasters. Methods: Mothers who are currently participating in two longitudinal studies, Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON; N = 1,800) and All Our Families (AOF: N = 2,534) were eligible to participate. Mothers were invited to complete the baseline COVID-19 Impact Survey (20–30 min) within 4 months of March 15, 2020, which was when the province of Alberta, Canada, implemented school closures and physical-distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Mothers were asked to report on their own, their child's and their family's functioning. Mothers were re-surveyed at 6 months after completion of the initial COVID-19 Impact Survey, and will be re-surveyed again at 12 months. Results: Responses from participants in both cohorts will be examined in harmonized analyses as well as separately. Descriptive, multivariable analysis will be undertaken to examine risk and resiliency over time and factors that predict mental health and well-being. Conclusions: This study will provide timely information on the impact of COVID-19 for Albertan families. It will identify risk and protective factors for mental health and well-being among contemporary urban families supported by a publicly funded health care system to inform allocation of resources to support those most vulnerable during a global pandemic. © Copyright © 2021 Letourneau, McDonald, MacKay, Bell, Hetherington, Deane, Dewey, Edwards, Field, Giesbrecht, Graham, Lebel, Leung, Madigan, McArthur, McMorris, Racine, Ross, Wu and Tough.

AB  - Introduction: Data show that maternal stress triggered by exposure to a natural disaster before, during or just after pregnancy is associated with adverse pregnancy and newborn outcomes. In this paper, the first aim is to describe our efforts to test a simple, low-cost intervention to large numbers of women following a major natural disaster. The second aim is to outline the challenges faced and lessons learned during the execution of this natural disaster study. Methods: The setting was the May 2016 Fort McMurray Wood Buffalo wildfire in northern Alberta, Canada. Women who were pregnant or preconception at the time of the disaster were invited to participate via social media. This prospective cohort study included a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of an expressive writing intervention on the levels of prenatal maternal stress and maternal, birth, and early childhood outcomes. At recruitment and at multiple timepoints postpartum, a battery of questionnaires was administered to evaluate objective and subjective stress exposure to the fire as well as maternal mental health, resilience and its contributing factors as well as infant developmental milestones. Qualitative content analysis of the expressive writing was conducted. Discussion: There is an increasing need to develop effective, wide-spread, rapid, and low-cost interventions to reduce prenatal maternal stress, increase resilience, and improve pregnancy outcomes following a natural disaster. Though analysis of data is ongoing, we highlight the strengths of this study which include strong community participation, rapid recruitment of eligible participants, low-cost intervention and data acquisition, and successful testing of the intervention. We acknowledge the challenges we encountered including the high rate of participant disqualifications or losses due to incomplete collection of online data; evacuation, dispersal, and inconsistent return to homes; and the high levels of stress accumulated post-disaster which led to inability to complete the study. Despite potential challenges, there remains a need for such research amid natural disasters. © Copyright © 2021 Hyde, Verstraeten, Olson, King, Brémault-Phillips and Olson.

AB  - Objectives We aimed to develop a systematic synthesis of systematic reviews of health impacts of climate change, by synthesising studies' characteristics, climate impacts, health outcomes and key findings. Design We conducted an overview of systematic reviews of health impacts of climate change. We registered our review in PROSPERO (CRD42019145972). No ethical approval was required since we used secondary data. Additional data are not available. Data sources On 22 June 2019, we searched Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria We included systematic reviews that explored at least one health impact of climate change. Data extraction and synthesis We organised systematic reviews according to their key characteristics, including geographical regions, year of publication and authors' affiliations. We mapped the climate effects and health outcomes being studied and synthesised major findings. We used a modified version of A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) to assess the quality of studies. Results We included 94 systematic reviews. Most were published after 2015 and approximately one-fifth contained meta-analyses. Reviews synthesised evidence about five categories of climate impacts; the two most common were meteorological and extreme weather events. Reviews covered 10 health outcome categories; the 3 most common were (1) infectious diseases, (2) mortality and (3) respiratory, cardiovascular or neurological outcomes. Most reviews suggested a deleterious impact of climate change on multiple adverse health outcomes, although the majority also called for more research. Conclusions Most systematic reviews suggest that climate change is associated with worse human health. This study provides a comprehensive higher order summary of research on health impacts of climate change. Study limitations include possible missed relevant reviews, no meta-meta-analyses, and no assessment of overlap. Future research could explore the potential explanations between these associations to propose adaptation and mitigation strategies and could include broader sociopsychological health impacts of climate change. ©

AB  - Bushfires substantially increase the environmental health risks for people living in af-fected areas, especially the disadvantaged (e.g., those experiencing health inequities due to their socio-economic status, racial/ethnic backgrounds, geographic location and/or sexual orientation) and those with pre-existing health conditions. Pregnant women exposed to bushfire smoke are at a greater risk of adverse pregnancy and foetal outcomes, especially if they smoke tobacco, which may compound the toxic impacts. Bushfires may also exacerbate mental stress, leading to an increase in smoking. There are gaps in the evidence and more research is required on the combined effect of bushfire smoke and tobacco smoke on pregnant populations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The 2020 wildfire season was devastating to the Western United States and affected the region’s NICUs. In this study, we ask the question, “what tools/strategies do medical professionals deem as important and most helpful as they are preparing for wildfire disaster response?” It is a follow up to our previous study: Learning from Wildfire Disaster Experience in California NICUs. We reevaluated how California NICUs dealt with the 2020 wildfires and expanded to Oregon and Southwest (SW) Washington NICUs. We conducted a survey with eleven Oregon and SW Washington NICUs about their wildfire evacuation preparedness. We also interviewed two neonatologists about their wildfire disaster experience evacuating their NICU or preparing to evacuate. Our findings suggest there is more work needed to fully prepare NICUs for wildfire disasters. We hope that by bringing light to the strategies used by affected clinicians, we can educate and support future NICU disaster preparedness responses. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Key message: A new process-based model,SurEau, is described. It predicts the risk of xylem hydraulic failure under drought. Context: The increase in drought intensity due to climate change will accentuate the risk of tree mortality. But very few process-based models are currently able to predict this mortality risk. Aims: We describe the operating principle of a new mechanistic model SurEau that computes the water balance, water relations, and hydraulics of a plant under extreme drought. Methods: SurEau is based on the formalization of key physiological processes of plant response to water stress. The hydraulic and hydric functioning of the plant is at the core of this model, which focuses on both water flows (i.e., hydraulic) and water pools (i.e., hydric) using variable hydraulic conductances. The model considers the elementary flow of water from the soil to the atmosphere through different plant organs that are described by their symplasmic and apoplasmic compartments. For each organ, the symplasm is described by a pressure-volume curve and the apoplasm by its vulnerability curve to cavitation. The model is evaluated on mature oak trees exposed to water stress. Results: On the tested oak trees, the model captures well the observed soil water balance, water relations, and level of embolism. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the level of embolism is strongly determined by air VPD and key physiological traits such as cuticular transpiration, resistance to cavitation, and leaf area. Conclusion: The process-based SurEau model offers new opportunities to evaluate how different species or genotypes will respond to future climatic conditions. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: Adults born either extremely preterm (EP, <28 weeks gestation) or extremely low birthweight (ELBW, <1000 g birthweight) have more obstructive airflow than controls of normal birthweight (>2499 g). We compared self-reported adverse respiratory health outcomes in young adults born EP/ELBW with controls following smoke exposure from the 2019/2020 wildfires in the Australian state of Victoria, and explored if any effects were mediated by airway obstruction, reflected in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<inf>1</inf>). Methods: EP/ELBW participants were derived from all survivors born in the state of Victoria in 1991–92. Contemporaneous controls of normal birthweight (>2499 g) were recruited in the newborn period and matched for sociodemographic variables. Both groups had been assessed at intervals through childhood and into adulthood. Those who participated in the most recent follow-up assessment at 25 years of age, when FEV<inf>1</inf> had been measured, were sent a survey when they were approximately 28 years of age asking about respiratory health related outcomes (respiratory symptoms, health services usage, medication uptake) following wildfire smoke exposure over the southern hemisphere summer of 2019–20. Results: A total of 296 participants (166 EP/ELBW; 130 controls) were sent the survey; 44% of the EP/ELBW group and 47% of the control group responded. Compared with controls, EP/ELBW respondents reported more overall respiratory problems (30%vs 20%) and specific respiratory symptoms (breathlessness, wheezing, cough and chest tightness) following wildfire smoke exposure, as well as higher health services usage (e.g. local health clinic, hospital emergency department) and medication uptake for respiratory-related problems. Higher FEV<inf>1</inf> values were associated with lower odds of most self-reported respiratory symptoms; adjusting for FEV<inf>1</inf> attenuated the differences between EP/ELW and control groups. Conclusion: Survivors born EP/ELBW may be at an increased risk of adverse respiratory health outcomes following wildfire smoke exposure in early adulthood, in part related to worse expiratory airflows. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this study we examine whether specific ‘anxiety-maintaining’ parenting behaviors (i.e., overinvolvement and/or negativity) exacerbate the effects of disaster-related prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) on school-age anxiety symptoms. Women (N = 230), pregnant at the time of the 2011 Queensland Floods, reported on their experience of flood-related PNMS (objective hardship, cognitive appraisal, subjective distress). At 4-years, mother–child dyads were coded for maternal overinvolvement and negativity during a challenging task; at 6-years mothers reported on their children’s anxiety symptoms and their own mood, N = 83. Results showed no associations between PNMS and 6-year anxiety, nor did parenting moderate these effects. Poorer maternal concurrent mood was associated with greater anxiety symptoms at 6 years (β = 0.52). Findings suggest maternal concurrent mood, but not exposure to disaster-related PNMS nor ‘anxiety-maintaining’ parenting behaviors at preschool age, is related to school-age anxiety symptoms. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Large-scale power outages (PO) are increasing in the context of climate change. Although some research has been conducted into the adverse health impacts of POs, significant gaps remain regarding whether POs would affect the health of pregnant women. We investigated the association between ED visits due to pregnancy complications and the occurence, intensity, and duration of large-scale POs in eight Sandy-affected counties in New York State (NYS). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, daily ED visits for pregnancy complications and large-scale PO data in eight counties in NYS from October to December in 2005–2014 were collected. Using time-series analysis, we estimated the relative increase in ED visits for pregnancy complications during POs compared with non-PO periods at lag 0–7 days. Short-term health impacts of PO intensity and PO duration were investigated. Estimations were also stratified by sociodemographic characteristics and disease subtypes including threatened or spontaneous abortion, threatened or early labor, hypertension complications, infections of genitourinary tract, renal diseases, gestational diabetes mellitus, mental illnesses, and cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy. Results: From October to December in 2005–2014, there were 307,739 ED visits for pregnancy complications in the eight counties. We found significant increases in ED visits for overall pregnancy complications (16.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.3%, 23.2%) during the Hurricane-PO period at lag 0–7 days. The ED visits increased by 8.8% per level increase in PO intensity and 1.4% per day increase in PO duration. Specifically, threatened/early delivery and gestational diabetes mellitus during the PO period increased by 26.7% (95% CI: 8.2%, 48.4%) and 111.8% (95% CI: 16.7%, 284.4%), respectively. Young adult, Black, Hispanic, and uninsured individuals were at higher risk of complications. Conclusions: POs may adversely impact pregnancy, especially for certain pregnancy complications and among low sociodemographic women. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Why does prenatal exposure to wars, natural disasters, urbanicity, or winter increase the risk for schizophrenia? Research from the last two decades has provided rich insight about the underlying chains of causation at play during environmental upheaval, from conception to early infancy. In this review, we appraise the evidence linking schizophrenia spectrum disorder to prenatal maternal stress, obstetric complications, early infections, and maternal nutrition and other lifestyle factors. We discuss putative mechanisms, including the maternal stress system, perinatal hypoxia, and maternal-offspring immune activation. We propose that gene-environment interactions, timing during development, and sex differentiate the neuropsychiatric outcomes. Future research should pursue the translation of animal studies to humans and the longitudinal associations between early exposures, intermediate phenotypes, and psychiatric disorders. Finally, to paint a comprehensive model of risk and to harness targets for prevention, we argue that risk factors should be situated within the individual's personal ecosystem. © 2021 Annual Reviews Inc..

AB  - Plant mortality is a complex process influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors. In recent decades, widespread mortality events have been attributed to increasing drought severity, which has motivated research to examine the physiological mechanisms of drought-induced mortality, particularly hydraulic failure. Drought-based mortality mechanisms are further influenced by plant interactions with biota such as neighboring plants, insect pests, and microbes. In this review, we highlight some of the most influential papers addressing these biotic interactions and their influence on plant mortality. Plant–plant interactions can be positive (facilitation), neutral, or negative (competition), depending on drought intensity and neighbor identity. For example, stand-scale mortality likely increases with basal area (an index of competition). However, the diversity of forest stands matters, as more diverse forests suffer less mortality from drought than species-poor forests. Dense forest stands also increase bark beetle attack frequency, which can exacerbate drought stress and mortality, particularly for fast-growing species with lower defense allocation. In some cases, however, drought stress can alleviate biotic attack, depending on feedbacks between plant and pest physiology. Finally, plant interactions with beneficial microorganisms can increase drought tolerance, reduce the likelihood of mortality, and even extend plant distributions into drier habitats. Our review suggests more work is needed in natural herbaceous plant communities as well as dry tropical ecosystems where mortality mechanisms are less understood. Overall, relatively few studies directly link biotic interactions with the physiological mechanisms of mortality. Simultaneous manipulations of biotic interactions and measurements of physiological thresholds (e.g., xylem cavitation) are needed to fully represent biotic interactions in predictive models of plant mortality. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Disaster has negative impacts on the reproductive health conditions of disaster victims, especially for vulnerable groups, namely increased maternal and neonatal deaths, increased risk of cases of sexual violence, sexually transmitted infections, unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions. This study aims to evaluate the implementation of the reproductive health program in the flash flood disaster in Sijunjung Regency, West Sumatra in 2018. The research was conducted qualitatively with a systems approach in the form of input, process and output. Determination of informants were done by purposive sampling. Data collection was carried out through in-depth interviews, FGDs, and document review. The results showed the input component: there was no regional regulation on reproductive health programs during a disaster, there were no special personnel for reproductive health, adequate funds, adequate facilities and infrastructure. Process components: no activity planning, no special reproductive health team, data collection has been carried out, needs assessments have been carried out, reproductive health services are available, monitoring has been carried out regularly. Output component: lack of information regarding the existence of reproductive health services during a disaster to the community so that the services provided are not optimal. The implementation of reproductive health programs during the flash flood disaster in Sijunjung Regency has not been optimal in terms of input, process and output. It is hoped that the head of the Sijunjung Regency Health Office will improve the implementation of the reproductive health program during the disaster. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Although the attention of the world and the global health community specifically is deservedly focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, other determinants of health continue to have large impacts and may also interact with COVID-19. Air pollution is one crucial example. Established evidence from other respiratory viruses and emerging evidence for COVID-19 specifically indicates that air pollution alters respiratory defense mechanisms leading to worsened infection severity. Air pollution also contributes to co-morbidities that are known to worsen outcomes amongst those infected with COVID-19, and air pollution may also enhance infection transmission due to its impact on more frequent coughing. Yet despite the massive disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are reasons for optimism: broad societal lockdowns have shown us a glimpse of what a future with strong air pollution measures could yield. Thus, the urgency to combat air pollution is not diminished, but instead heightened in the context of the pandemic. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - In late 2019, the new Coronavirus has been identified in the city of Wuhan then COVID-19 spreads like wildfire in the rest of the world. Pregnant women represent a risk category for increased abortion rates and vertical transmission with adverse events on the newborns has been recently confirmed. The scientific world is struggling for finding an effective cure for counteracting symptomatology. Today, there are many therapeutic proposes but none of them can effectively counteract the infection. Moreover, many of these compounds show important side effects not justifying their use. Scientific literature reports an immune system over-reaction through interleukins-6 activation. In this regard, the possibility to control the immune system represents a possible strategy for counteracting the onset of COVID-19 symptomatology. Vitamin D deficiency shows increased susceptibility to acute viral respiratory infections. Moreover, Vitamin D seems involved in host protection from different virus species by modulating activation and release of cytokines. Myo-inositol down-regulates the expression of IL-6 by phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Furthermore, myo-inositol is the precursor of phospholipids in the surfactant and it is applied for inducing surfactant synthesis in infants for treating respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). This review aims to summarize the evidence about COVID-19 infection in pregnant women and to encourage the scientific community to investigate the use of Vitamin D and Myo-inositol which could represent a possible preventive treatment for pregnant women or women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Prescribed burning is used for reducing future wildfire risk; however, it creates smoke, which can affect human health. Using newly available high-frequency daily data (2015–2017) on PM2.5 specifically attributed to smoke from prescribed burns in Georgia, USA, this analysis investigates infant health externalities connected to these burns. Cumulatively, over an average pregnancy, smoke from prescribed burns is associated with a 1.02 percentage point increase in instances of low birth weight and prematurity, each. For every $1 spent on prescribed burning, $0.43–$2.46 in state-wide low birth weight and prematurity hospitalization costs are created. Various robustness and specification checks are performed.

AB  - The under-5 mortality rate has declined from 93 deaths per 1000 live births in 1990 to 39 per 1000 live births in 2018. This improvement in child survival warrants an examination of age-specific trends and causes of death over time and across regions and an extension of the survival focus to older children and adolescents. We examine patterns and trends in mortality for neonates, postneonatal infants, young children, older children, young adolescents and older adolescents from 2000 to 2016. Levels and trends in causes of death for children and adolescents under 20 years of age are based on United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation for all-cause mortality, the Maternal and Child Epidemiology Estimation group for cause of death among children under-5 and WHO Global Health Estimates for 5-19 year-olds. From 2000 to 2016, the proportion of deaths in young children aged 1-4 years declined in most regions while neonatal deaths became over 25% of all deaths under 20 years in all regions and over 50% of all under-5 deaths in all regions except for sub-Saharan Africa which remains the region with the highest under-5 mortality in the world. Although these estimates have great variability at the country level, the overall regional patterns show that mortality in children under the age of 5 is increasingly concentrated in the neonatal period and in some regions, in older adolescents. The leading causes of disease for children under-5 remain preterm birth and infectious diseases, pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria. For older children and adolescents, injuries become important causes of death as do interpersonal violence and self-harm. Causes of death vary by region. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AB  - After the global outbreak of coronaviruses caused diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an outbreak due to these viruses occurred in December, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and led to a worldwide spread. Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a serious global health emergency and spread from a person to another who has the virus. But the scope of an intermediate host is not known. Population at higher risk includes individuals in higher age group (>60 years) or with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and weaker immune system. Many unknown and underestimate risk factors could be responsible for adverse outcomes in COVID-19. These risk factors should be appropriately identified, addressed and necessary actions should be taken to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic. Bhopal gas tragedy was one of the world’s worst industrial chemical leak disaster. The survivors of this incident still suffer from the various complications such as increased rate of cancers, chronic illness like tuberculosis, respiratory diseases, birth defects, nerve injury, growth retardations, gynecological illness and many more. The survivors of Bhopal gas tragedy are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 related adverse outcome. One of the possible explanations can be long term effect of methyl isocyanate (MIC). MIC exposure can lead to possible toxic effect on genetic, epigenetic and non-genetic factors. In this review, we aim to establish the scientific basis for adverse outcome in COVID-19 patients who are also victims of Bhopal gas tragedy. © 2021 De Gruyter. All rights reserved.

TI  - Crude oil and public health issues in Niger Delta, Nigeria: Much ado about the inevitable
AU  - Orisakwe, O.E.

VL  - 194
AB  - The importance of crude oil has come at a great cost. In many developing economies of the world, it can be described as the bitter-sweet crude for its double-edged impacts on the welfare, wellness and wellness of the people. Agitations and restiveness remain characteristic features of Niger Delta following claims of exploitation and neglect of the local population by the multinationals. Literature on the environmental and public health impacts of crude oil was searched from relevant databases such as google scholar, Science Direct, Scopus and PubMed. This paper is a translational scientific and toxicological insight on what should be done by the major players rather than casting unending aspersions. Since living near oil spills and crude oil production sites is an environmental stressor occasioned by exposure to both chemical pollutants and physical menace that are all detrimental to health, cumulative risk assessment CRA is proposed as a viable approach for a comprehensive understanding of the size of this problem. Multinational oil companies should support development of Environmental Medicine Research which will in turn generate data on both how to harness the natural resources to combat the public health issues associated with oil exploration and the mitigation and remediation of the environment. This endeavor will create a waste-to-wealth program that will pacify the restiveness in oil exploring communities. It will be interesting to know that in the same environment that breeds the elephant-in-the-parlor lies the natural antidotes to check-mate the public health malady. © 2021

AB  - Environmental disasters impact disadvantaged communities disproportionately both through the epidemiological challenge of exposure, but also by undermining the progress of public health efforts. This paper studies changes to smoking cessation, breastfeeding, and weight gain during pregnancy in the period following the switch in water supply in Flint, Michigan, in April 2014. As the switch resulted in immediate and significant deterioration in water quality, eventually leading to its contamination with lead, we estimate a 10.5 percentage point increase in smoking and a 2.1 percentage point decrease in breastfeeding. We show evidence that these changes in maternal behavior are linked to increased stress due to changing water quality. We estimate that the increase in smoking alone is responsible for most of the increase in incidence of low birthweight among infants in Flint, resulting in $700 additional costs per birth. Increased smoking during pregnancy and lower breastfeeding rates in Flint roll back years of public health efforts, resulting in lifetime higher rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer for mothers in the community. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Although global health training expands clinical and sociocultural expertise for graduate medical trainees and is increasingly in demand, evidence-based courses are limited. To improve self-assessed competence for clinical scenarios encountered during international rotations, we developed and assessed a simulation-based workshop called Preparing Residents for International Medical Experiences. Methods: High-fidelity simulation activities for anesthesiology, surgery, and OB/GYN trainees involved three scenarios. The first was a mass casualty in a low-resource setting requiring distribution of human and material resources. In the second, learners managed a septic operative patient and coordinated postoperative care without an ICU bed available. The final scenario had learners evaluate a non-English-speaking patient with pre-eclampsia. We paired simulation with small-group discussion to address sociobehavioral factors, stress, and teaching skills. Participants evaluated the quality of the teaching provided. In addition, we measured anesthesiology trainees' self-assessed competence before and after the workshop. Results: The workshop included 23 learners over two iterations. Fifteen trainees (65%) completed the course evaluation, 93% of whom strongly agreed that the training met the stated objectives. Thirteen out of 15 (87%) anesthesiology trainees completed the competence survey. After the training, more trainees indicated confidence in providing clinical care with indirect supervision or independently. Mean self-assessed competency scores on a scale of 1-5 increased for all areas, with a mean competency increase of 0.3 (95% CI, 0.2-0.5). Discussion: Including simulation in a pretravel workshop can improve trainees' self-assessed competence for a variety of scenarios involving clinical care in limited-resource settings. © 2021 Kynes et al.

AB  - Background In June 2013, the city of Calgary, Alberta and surrounding areas sustained significant flooding which resulted in large scale evacuations and closure of businesses and schools. Floods can increase stress which may negatively impact perinatal outcomes and mental health, but previous research is inconsistent. The objectives of this study are to examine the impact of the flood on pregnancy health, birth outcomes and postpartum mental health. Methods Linked administrative data from the province of Alberta were used. Outcomes included preterm birth, small for gestational age, a new diagnoses of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, and a diagnosis of, or drug prescription for, depression or anxiety. Data were analyzed using a quasi-experimental difference in difference design, comparing flooded and non-flooded areas and in affected and unaffected time periods. Multivariable log binomial regression models were used to estimate risk ratios, adjusted for maternal age. Marginal probabilities for the difference in difference term were used to show the potential effect of the flood. Results Participants included 18,266 nulliparous women for the pregnancy outcomes, and 26,956 women with infants for the mental health analysis. There were no effects for preterm birth (DID 0.00, CI: -0.02, 0.02), small for gestational age (DID 0.00, CI: -0.02, 0.02), or new cases of preeclampsia (DID 0.00, CI: -0.01, 0.01). There was a small increase in new cases of gestational hypertension (DID 0.02, CI: 0.01, 0.03) in flood affected areas. There were no differences in postpartum anxiety or depression prescriptions or diagnoses. Conclusion The Calgary 2013 flood was associated with a minor increase in gestational hypertension and not other health outcomes. Universal prenatal care and magnitude of the disaster may have minimized impacts of the flood on pregnant women. © 2021 Hetherington et al.

TI  - Effects of supplementary feeding lucerne hay and barley grain to Angora does during the last third of pregnancy and lactation, and of litter size on pasture, birth weight, live weight, parasitism, milk production, milk composition and mohair production

AB  - The effects of feeding lucerne hay (Medicago sativa) and or barley grain to grazing reproducing Angora does on birth weight, live weight, body condition, quality and production of milk and mohair and gastrointestinal parasitism were investigated in does and kids. The design was supplementation for the last 8 weeks prepartum to 8 weeks postpartum with 5 levels of whole barley grain (GL: 0, 115, 230, 345, 460 g/d/doe) × 2 levels of hay supplementation (HL, 380 g/d/doe 8 weeks prepartum, 0 g/d postpartum; HH, 830 g/d/doe 8 weeks prepartum, 800 g/d/doe 8 weeks postpartum) × 2 randomised blocks. This provided 20 experimental plots, 10 for each level of hay and 4 for each GL. Each plot contained one dry doe, three single litter does, and one twin litter doe. Pastoral conditions were poor with low availability of green pasture until late spring. Does kidded in early August. Important results were: GL affected kid live weight, milk production, composition and secretion of milk solids, total mohair production and some mohair quality measures but GL increased fibre diameter and incidence of medullated fibres in kid mohair; optimum performance at day 40 of lactation was GL 345 which produced 2325 g/d milk corrected to 4% fat. HH increased secretion of milk protein and total solids compared with HL. Twin litters had greater persistence in lactation to day 100 of lactation compared with single litters. There was evidence that high levels of barley feeding reduced faecal egg count. Dry does gained more live weight, grew 26 % more mohair which was 1.7 μm coarser compared with does with single litter. The results indicate that feeding lucerne hay even under adverse seasonal conditions was of little value. The lactation performance of these grazing Angora does was substantially less than their potential. Optimum barley feeding was GL 345 g/d/doe. There was evidence of substitution of pasture for hay. The results quantified the production responses and penalties of Angora does when litter size was increased from non-pregnant status (zero) to 2. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study focuses on Guizhou Province, a region with difficult geographical conditions and poor economic development, to examine the effect of rainfall shocks on contemporaneous infant health and long-run socioeconomic outcomes in China. The study results indicate that negative rainfall shocks are robustly correlated with higher infant mortality and lower birth weight. In the long run, early life rainfall shortages limit an individual's income and housing conditions. The study findings indicate a significant interaction of rainfall shock with the severity of water scarcity. This result implies that drinking water safety is an essential channel through which early life rainfall shocks influence individual health endowments. However, agriculture production is not a likely channel for rainfall effects despite its association with infant mortality. Accordingly, our empirical results suggest that improving public facility coverage will reduce the vulnerability of infant health to adverse rainfall shocks in Guizhou and other developing areas. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Non-invasive respiratory support for neonates using bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) delivery systems is now widespread owing to its safety, cost effectiveness and easy applicability. Many innovative solutions have been suggested to deal with the possible shortage in desperate situations like disasters, pandemics and resource-limited settings. Although splitting of invasive ventilation has been reported previously, no attempts to split non-invasive respiratory support have been reported. The primary objective was to test the feasibility of splitting the bCPAP assembly using a T-piece splitter in a simulation model. Methods A pilot simulation-based study was done to split a single bCPAP assembly using a T-piece. Other materials consisted of a heated humidification system, an air oxygen blender, corrugated inspiratory and expiratory tubing, nasal interfaces and two intercostal chest tube drainage bags. Two pressure manometers were used simultaneously to measure delivered pressures at different levels of set bCPAPs at the expiratory limb of nasal interfaces. Results Pressures measured at the expiratory end of two nasal interfaces were 5.1 and 5.2 cm H 2 O, respectively, at a flow of 6 L/min and a water level of 5 cm H 2 O in both chest bags. When tested across different levels of set continuous positive airway pressure (3-8 cmH 2 O) and fractional inspired oxygen concentration (0.30-1.0), measured parameters corresponded to set parameters. Conclusion bCPAP splitting using a T-piece splitter is a technically simple, feasible and reliable strategy tested in a simulation model. Further testing is needed in a simulated lung model. ©

AB  - Background: Disasters are associated with worse perinatal outcomes, perhaps due to inadequate prenatal care (PNC). Methods: Using 2017-2019 Florida vital statistics, we compared PNC use before and after Hurricane Michael. We categorized counties as most affected (Area A) or less affected (Area B and C). We examined whether Michael’s effects on perinatal outcomes varied by maternity care availability and used the Baron and Kenny method to assess whether delayed PNC initiation mediated perinatal outcomes. Log-binomial regression and semi-parametric linear regression were used, controlling for maternal and ZIP code tabulation area characteristics. Results: Compared to the one-year period pre-Michael, the week of the first PNC was later in all areas in the one-year period post-Michael, with the largest change in Area A (adjusted difference 0.112, 95% CI: 0.055-0.169), where women were less likely to receive PNC overall (aRR = 0.994, 95% CI = 0.990-0.998) and more likely to have inadequate PNC (aRR = 1.193, 95% CI = 1.127-1.264). Michael’s effects on perinatal outcomes did not vary significantly by maternity care availability within Area A. Delayed PNC initiation appeared to mediate an increased risk in small for gestational age (SGA) births after Michael. Conclusion: Women in Area A initiated PNC later and had a higher likelihood of inadequate PNC. Delayed PNC initiation may partially explain increased risk of SGA. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The Problem: Global environmental stressors of human health include, but are not limited to, conflict, migration, war, natural disasters, climate change, pollution, trauma, and pandemics. In combination with other factors, these stressors influence physical and mental as well as reproductive health. Maternal stress is a known factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth (PTB); however, environmental stressors are less well-understood in this context and the problem is relatively under-researched. According to the WHO, major Indian cities including New Delhi are among the world's 20 most polluted cities. It is known that maternal exposure to environmental pollution increases the risk of premature births and other adverse pregnancy outcomes which is evident in this population. Response to the Problem: Considering the seriousness of this problem, an international and interdisciplinary group of researchers, physicians, and organizations dedicated to the welfare of women at risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes launched an international program named Optimal Pregnancy Environment Risk Assessment (OPERA). The program aims to discover and disseminate inexpensive, accessible tools to diagnose women at risk for PTB and other adverse pregnancy outcomes due to risky environmental factors as early as possible and to promote effective interventions to mitigate these risks. OPERA has been supported by the Worldwide Universities Network, World Health Organization (WHO) and March of Dimes USA. Addressing the Problem: This review article addresses the influence of environmental stressors on maternal-fetal health focusing on India as a model population and describes the role of OPERA in helping local practitioners by sharing with them the latest risk prediction and mitigation tools. The consequences of these environmental stressors can be partially mitigated by experience-based interventions that build resilience and break the cycle of inter- and-transgenerational transmission. The shared knowledge and experience from this collaboration are intended to guide and facilitate efforts at the local level in India and other LMIC to develop strategies appropriate for the jurisdiction for improving pregnancy outcomes in vulnerable populations. © © 2021 Jain, Jain, Metz, Ballanyi, Sood, Linder and Olson.

AB  - Imagine for a moment a series of disasters that kills more than 800 women every day for a year: the equivalent of two or three daily crashes of crowded long-distance airliners or the equivalent of the direct death toll from the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon every four days. There is little question that such a situation would quickly be regarded as a humanitarian emergency, as the stuff of headlines, especially if ways of preventing the events were well known and widely practiced (as is the case with avoiding crashes in civil aviation). However, remarkably little attention is paid outside the global health and human rights domains to complications of pregnancy and childbirth that kill more than 300,000 women every year – a cause of death now almost unheard of in high-income countries (HICs), although this would not have been the case a century ago. A Canadian woman’s lifetime risk of dying from complications of pregnancy or childbirth is 1 in 8,800; for a woman in Sub-Saharan Africa, the world’s poorest region, it is 1 in 36 (Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group, 2015). © Cambridge University Press 2011, 2021.

AB  - Background: Primary care nurses play a pivotal role in the response to disasters and pandemics. The coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic required preventative, diagnostic, and curative measures for persons presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 by healthcare providers, whilst continuing other essential services. We aimed to investigate the reorganisation of primary care services during COVID-19 from the perspectives of primary care nurses in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Methods: We administered an online survey with closed and open-ended questions to professional nurses enrolled for a Postgraduate Diploma in Primary Care Nursing at Stellenbosch University (2020) and alumni (2017–2019) working in the Western Cape. Eighty-three participants completed the questionnaire. Results: The majority of the participants (74.4%) reported that they were reorganising services using a multitude of initiatives in response to the diverse infrastructure, logistics and services of the various healthcare facilities. Despite this, 48.2% of the participants expressed concerns, which mainly related to possible non-adherence of patients with chronic conditions, the lack of promotive and preventative services, challenges with facility infrastructure, and staff time devoted to triage and screening. More than half of the participants (57.8%) indicated that other services were affected by COVID-19, whilst 44.6% indicated that these services were worse than before. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the very necessary reorganisation of services that took place at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa enabled effective management of patients infected with COVID-19. However, the reorganisation of services may have longer-term consequences for primary care services in terms of lack of care for patients with other conditions, as well as preventive and promotive care. © 2021.

AB  - Events that occur during fetal and perinatal life can have consequences on the health and disease of the offspring. The pioneering work on the "Fetal Programming Hypothesis" focused on pregnant women exposed to a great famine that occurred in the Netherlands at the end of World War II. The intrauterine environment of the babies during that famine caused them to low birthweight and determined the appearance of cardiovascular diseases in themselves when they reached adulthood, a risk that was transmitted even to the following generation. In addition to the general stress that a pregnant woman may suffer as a result of the death of a family member, suffering a war or natural disaster such as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, there is another specific type of stress that refers exclusively to the pregnancy process; this is the pregnancy specific-stress. Pregnancy-specific stress is capable of sensitively predicting negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. This type of stress refers to the specific stress of pregnant women related to medical problems, the health of the newborn, the changes that the pregnancy will produce in their social relationships, prematurity, physical changes of pregnancy and fear of labor and birth. The objective of this article was to offer an updated information on pregnancy-specific stress and its consequences for maternal and neonatal health. Thus, we also proposed to offer strategies that midwives and psychologists can use to reduce pregnancy-specific stress levels. In conclusion, midwives and psychologists can work together to reduce pregnancy-specific stress levels. © 2021 Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo. All rights reserved.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has swept across the world like an indiscriminating wildfire. Pregnant women and neonates are particularly vulnerable to this infection compared with older children and healthy young adults, with unique challenges in their management. Unfamiliarity with the consequences of this novel virus and lack of high-quality data led to considerable heterogeneity in obstetrical and neonatal management early in the pandemic. The aim of the this review is to summarize the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnancy and childbirth and to examine care and possible outcomes for neonates with Covid-19-positive mothers.

AB  - Freud's 1911 and Niederland's 1959 problematic interpretations of Schreber's Memoirs set off a flood of secondary literature. In both selected facts were paired with a plethora of fictions. The narratives of Schreber father and son were misdescribed, misdiagnosed, and misinterpreted, errors have been uncritically copied by commentators ever since. Freud's theory of homosexuality as a cause of paranoia has not stood the test of time. In 1963 Niederland himself stated that the data he collected on Schreber father and son do not explain Schreber's second illness. A further misconception was to totalize both Schreber as person and the content of his book as psychotic, controverted by the fact that Schreber recovered by 1897 and the book is a creative essay with a profound moral message. Schreber's hermaphroditic fantasies were neither homosexual desires toward psychiatrist Flechsig nor morbid delusions but images of an identification with or compassion for his wife who suffered repeated miscarriages and stillbirths. The author revisits the description, diagnosis, dynamics, and deontology of Schreber's story from the perspective of dramatology and narratology and adds new information and insights. The goal of this essay is not only historical, but also a clinical and practical approach to fantasy and delusion. © 2021 The International Federation of Psychoanalytic Societies.

AB  - Introduction: During natural disaster a sudden increase in infant mortality and morbidity rates are reported. Breastfeeding practices are essential to prevent malnutrition-related mortalities among infants during disaster and displacement. Methods: Findings from the undertaken critical ethnographic study in the disaster relief camps of Chitral, Pakistan, were referred to identify need-based policies to promote, protect, and support breastfeeding among displaced mothers. Policy Implications: The study identified the need for strategic policies at sociocultural, economic, and geopolitical levels to support breastfeeding and save lives of young children during natural disasters. Conclusion: This article will facilitate clinicians, healthcare providers, and national and international agencies to recognize gaps in the existing policies and services targeting breastfeeding mothers during disaster and displacement. © Copyright 2021 United States Lactation Consulting Association.

AB  - Background: The emerging global issue of climate change has large-scale effects on health and well-being, including communication disorders. The broad range of the speech and language therapy profession's scope of practice incorporates prevention, advocacy and equality in service delivery. These act as a springboard for involvement in climate change and health. Aims: This is an appeal to speech and language therapists (SLTs) to focus and take action on this issue and its considerable effects on communication and swallowing disorders. Methods & Procedures: This article discusses the importance of taking a public health position on prevention and equality of services to manage environmental determinants of communication and swallowing disorders. It also describes the extent to which climate change affects these disorders and exacerbates the inequality of healthcare services in low- and middle-income countries. Main Contribution: Five strategies are provided for action on fulfilling therapists’ roles in reducing the incidence, development and exacerbation of climate-related communication and swallowing disorders, as well as the role of SLTs in acting as advocates. The case is made for expanding the scope of services to focus on prevention and service equality so as to best meet the needs of the wider community. Conclusions & Implications: Despite other challenges currently facing SLTs, climate change and its increasing effects on communication disorders and dysphagia is difficult to ignore. SLTs owe it to their clients, the wider community, low- and middle-income countries, the economy, and the future to take action. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that climate change is extremely likely to be due to human activities. The global effects will be higher temperatures, changes in precipitation, more droughts and heatwaves, stronger and more intense hurricanes, and a rising sea level which directly threaten the health of entire populations. Other health professions are beginning to take climate change into account in training and practice. What this paper adds to existing knowledge Many disorders of communication and swallowing are caused or exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Increasing temperatures, extremes of precipitation, population displacement and air pollution contribute to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, respiratory disease, malnutrition, premature birth, air- and water-borne diseases, and mental illness. These may affect the communication and swallowing abilities across the lifespan, but particularly those of children and older adults. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? SLTs’ roles in prevention, advocacy and education act as a starting point for involvement in climate change and health. Three practical strategies for action include educating SLTs and other health professionals on climate change and its effects on communication and swallowing, promoting awareness with clients and their families, and gathering and disseminating reliable data. © 2020 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists

AB  - We examine the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic’s explosion in the New York Metropolitan Region from the perspective of both historical trajectory and Holling (Ann Rev Ecol Syst 4:1–23, 1973) ideas of ‘ecosystem resilience’ transitions, akin to the eutrophication of a pristine lake by sewage runoff. Without significant alteration in ‘upstream’ policies and power relations driving pandemic emergence, the US Empire appears to be entering a period of ‘Justinian Plagues’ similar to those that decimated the Roman Empire. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Methods developed to analyze spread of the 1980–1990 AIDS syndemic within the New York Metropolitan Region (NYMR) are updated and applied to the rate of COVID-19 deaths in the early months of the pandemic, and to premature mortality, across that conurbation. For COVID deaths, 21 of the 24 NYMR counties are strongly linked through diffusion mechanisms well indexed by standard journey-to-work statistics, as modulated by local poverty rates. While the Bronx leads the COVID death rate, three highly affluent counties—Hunterdon, New Jersey; Putnam, New York; and Manhattan—are less well-integrated into the overall spread process at this early stage. These areas, however, must ultimately be drawn into the system of the other 21 counties over the next few years. There is, after all, no effective mechanism to impede the ultimate spread of the infection: concentration is not containment, but the central mechanism for the emergence of pathogens across both local and national urban structures. Comparison of the COVID death pattern with that of general premature mortality shows a striking inverse commuting pattern, but similar dependence on poverty. For both afflictions, the Bronx, focus of ‘planned shrinkage’ polices of the 1970s, is singularly marked by death. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The elemental halogens include chlorine, bromine, and phosgene. Halogen gas can be directly weaponized and employed in warfare or terrorism. Industrial stockpiles or halogen transport can provide targets for terrorist attack as well as an origin for accidental release creating a risk for potential mass-casualty incidents. Pregnant and post-partum women represent a substantial and vulnerable subset of the population who may be at particular risk during an attack or accidental exposure. We review the effects of halogen exposure on the parturient with a focus on bromine toxicity. Bromine is the most extensively studied agent in the context of pregnancy and to-date murine models form the basis for the majority of current knowledge. Pregnancy potentiates the acute lung injury after halogen exposure. In addition, halogen exposure precipitates a preeclamptic-like syndrome in mice. This phenotype is characterized by systemic and pulmonary hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, decreased cardiac output, placental injury and fetal growth restriction. This constellation contributes to increased maternal and fetal mortality observed after bromine exposure. Angiogenic imbalance is noted with overexpression of the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) form of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 reminiscent of human preeclampsia. Additional research is needed to further explore the effect of halogen gas exposure in pregnancy and to develop therapeutic interventions to mitigate risk to this unique population. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Simultaneous exposure to natural calamities and conflict shocks is a phenomenon that has been largely understudied. The interplay between natural disasters and conflict shocks can have adverse effects extending beyond the current family members to children in utero. The current paper tries to fill this gap by investigating the impact of floods on pregnancy and birth outcomes across conflict-affected and unaffected districts in Pakistan. Using mother fixed effects strategy, the results suggest that in-utero exposure to violence during flood increases the probability of small birth size by 4.7 percentage points. Moreover, simultaneous exposure to flood and violence increases the probability of miscarriages and stillbirths by 6 and 1.9 percentage points, respectively. Significant heterogeneities are found across income groups and education levels. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to assess the effects of the Great East Japan Earthquake on hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) in the Fukushima Prefecture. Methods: We used the results of the Fukushima Health Management Survey which targeted women who gave birth from 2011–2012. Pregnant women were divided into three groups according to their residential area during the disaster (affected, middle, and less-affected area), and four groups according to pregnancy trimester during the disaster (first, second, third trimester, or conception after the disaster). Adjusted odds ratio (aORs) for HDP of each residential area was calculated using logistic regression models, with pregnancy trimester during the disaster as references. Results: Overall, 8323 women participated in the study (affected area: 2207; middle area: 5183; and less-affected area: 933). For women living in the affected and middle areas in the third trimester, the disaster was a significant risk factor for HDP (aOR: 2.61, 1.02–6.66, aOR: 1.93, 1.10–3.40, respectively). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate patient residential areas and gestational age during the time of a disaster to estimate the risk of HDP. The third trimester of pregnancy at the time of the disaster was associated with HDP for the women living in the affected and middle areas. The knowledge of the data on disaster-related obstetrical complications can help obstetric care providers in a disaster area provide appropriate medical aid in an emergency. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Introduction: Virtual simulation (VS) is an adaptable medium for teaching critical disaster management skills such as efficient hospital evacuation.Weaimed to compare VS and prerecorded narrated multimedia lecture-based training of pediatric nurses for evacuation of a sick newborn in the neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric emergency department (ED) using live evacuation simulations. Methods: Thirty neonatal intensive care unit and 30 ED nurses enrolled with 30 randomized tomultimedia lecture and 30 randomized to VS, with equal block distribution of nurses from each unit. Pretraining/posttraining surveys were administered, and live evacuation simulations were scored for time to evacuation, items collected, and communication. Results: Overall, disaster preparation and communication improved within the VS group as compared with the multimedia lecture group. Virtual simulation rated more immersive (P < 0.001), better at safety threat identification (P < 0.05), and better at evacuation preparation compared with multimedia lecture (P < 0.01). Virtual simulation participants felt more prepared in disaster response (P < 0.001) and patient evacuation (P < 0.001). Both groups packed equal essential items, but VS participants packed more equipment (mean, 19 vs. 15, P < 0.01) with no significant evacuation time difference between the VS group (145 ± 58 seconds) and multimedia lecture group (152 ± 59 seconds, P = not significant). Virtual simulation participants had better communication ratings with the charge nurse (P < 0.05) and family (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Virtual simulation was well received by nurses compared with multimedia lecture and may be an effective adjunct for training nurses on infant patient evacuation during a disaster. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, the statistical analyses therein raised several questions. First, ecological variables are not justified enough to adjust potential confounding. Second, the spatiotemporal regression model does not consider temporal reduction in radiation dose rate. Third, dose-response plot between dose rates and odds ratios overestimates R2 and underestimates p value. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To investigate the long-term effect of prenatal exposure to earthquake stress on diabetes risk in the adulthood. Methods: This study included employees of Tangshan Kailuan Mining Group between July 29, 1976 and April 28, 1977. The exposure group included subjects who experienced the Tangshan Earthquake during their prenatal period and who had lived in Tangshan since birth. The non-exposure group included subjects who were born 1–1.9 years after the earthquake and who had lived in Tangshan since birth. A questionnaire was designed that included sociodemographic information, conditions during pregnancy, and earthquake experience. Anthropometric measurements including height and weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference were made. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and lipid profiles were also determined. Results: Totally 947 subjects were included with 397 subjects in the exposed group and 550 subjects in the non-exposed group. The diabetes rate is significant different in these four groups(χ2 =8.045, P = 0.045). Moreover, 11.8, 7.5 and 8.0% of the subjects who were exposed to earthquake in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester of pregnancy had diabetes. 5.1% of the subjects had diabetes in non-exposure group. Our multivariate analysis showed that 1st trimester (OR 2.481, 95%CI 1.02, 6.034; P = 0.045) and loss of family members during earthquake (OR 2.452, 95%CI 1.293, 4.653; P = 0.006) were associated with significantly increased risk of diabetes. Conclusions: Exposure to earthquake during the first trimester of pregnancy and experience of family member loss in the earthquake significantly increased the subsequent risk of diabetes in the middle age (36–39 years of age). Our data suggest that earthquake experience in the early pregnancy has a longer-term effect on diabetes risk during adulthood. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Over the past 30 years, maternal mortality has increased in the United States to 18 deaths per 100,000 live births. Obstetric emergencies, including hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, HELLP syndrome, and amniotic fluid embolism, and anesthesia complications, including high neuraxial blockade, local anesthetic systemic toxicity, and the difficult obstetric airway, contribute to maternal cardiac arrest and maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Expeditious intervention by the obstetric anesthesiologist is critical in these emergent scenarios, and knowledge of best practices is essential to improve maternal and fetal outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We examine the impact of a major earthquake that unexpectedly affected the Canterbury region of New Zealand on a wide-range of birth outcomes, including birth weight, gestational age, and an indicator of general newborn health. We control for observed and unobserved differences between pregnant women in the area affected by the earthquake and other pregnant women by including mother fixed effects in all of our regression models. We extend the previous literature by comparing the impact of the initial unexpected earthquake to the impacts of thousands of aftershocks that occurred in the same region over the 18 months following the initial earthquake. We find that exposure to these earthquakes reduced gestational age, increased the likelihood of having a late birth, and negatively affected newborn health—with the largest effects for earthquakes that occurred in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy. Our estimates are similar when we focus on just the impact of the initial earthquake or, in contrast, on all earthquakes controlling for endogenous location decisions using an instrumental variables approach. This suggests that the previous estimates in the literature that use this approach are likely unbiased and that treatment effects are homogenous in the population. We present supporting evidence that the likely channel for these adverse effects is maternal stress. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - We study the health consequences of one of the largest environmental disasters of the world mining industry, which largely stemmed from regulatory failure. Exploiting the timing and location of the Mariana mine tailings dam collapse in Brazil, we show that in utero exposure to the tragedy significantly reduced birth weight and increased infant mortality. The adverse effects were stronger for infants born to less educated and nonmarried mothers. These findings indicate that poorly enforced environmental regulation may have long-term welfare impacts on local communities. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Even though the global COVID-19 pandemic may affect how medical care is delivered in general, most countries try to maintain steady access for women to routine pregnancy care, including fetal anomaly screening. This means that, also during this pandemic, fetal anomalies will be detected, and that discussions regarding invasive genetic testing and possibly fetal therapy will need to take place. For patients, concerns about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus 2 will add to the anxiety caused by the diagnosis of a serious fetal anomaly. Yet, also for fetal medicine teams the situation gets more complex as they must weigh up the risks and benefits to the fetus as well as the mother, while managing a changing evidence base and logistic challenges in their healthcare system. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The study was conducted in Amhara region of Ethiopia, with the objective of characterizing the goat husbandry practice and on-farm monitoring of growth performance. The data were collected by interviewing 180 sample households who are selected purposively from three agro ecologies using semi- structured questioner. Besides, on farm monitoring of growth performance of 60 kids owned by farmers was done for three months. The data was analyzed using SPSS (version 20). Majority of households (68.9%) have an experiences of feeding crop residue for their goat and faced feed shortage mainly during dry season (65.6%). The main source of water for goat was river which is 51.1% in wet season and 88.9% in dry season. 51.7% of goat keepers had a separate goat house. The major disease reported were anthrax (40.6%), goat pox (26.7%) and foot and mouth disease (12.8). Purpose of goat keeping was mainly for income source (62.8%). 84.4% of the goat owners are experienced selection of male and female animal for production purpose. Body length and height (60.6%) and color (34.4%) were used as major selection criteria. Higher kidding was reported during months of October (20.55%), November (39.44%) and December (18.88%). Drought (42%), shortage of feed and water (38.5%), disease and parasite (16%), inconvenient climate condition (2%) and lack of breeding male (1%) were reported as major problems in the breeding objective. The overall birth weight, 60 days and 90 days weight of kids was 1.69±0.08 kg, 7.45±0.41 kg and 12.02±0.25 kg, respectively. The survival rate of kids up to 90 days of age was 74%. The production system of the area was characterized by mixed crop-livestock farming system on which crop residue was the main feed source of the goats as other livestock species. Even though the current productivity of goats in the area is fairly good, full potential need to be exploited by improving husbandry practices, applying appropriate disease prevention methods and applying strategic forage development and feeding practices. © 2020, Online Journal of Animal and Feed Research.

AB  - Strong institutions as well as economic development are generally understood to play critical roles in protecting societies from the adverse impacts of natural hazards, such as tropical cyclones. The independent effect of institutions on reducing these risks, however, has not been confirmed empirically in previous global studies. As a storm’s path and intensity influence the severity of the damages and may be spatially correlated with human vulnerabilities, failing to accurately capture physical exposure in an econometric analysis may result in imprecise and biased estimates of the influence of the independent variables. Here, we develop an approach to control for physical exposure by spatially interacting meteorological and socioeconomic data for over 1,000 tropical cyclone disasters from 1979 to 2016. We find evidence that higher levels of national government effectiveness are associated with lower tropical cyclone mortality, even when controlling for average income and other socioeconomic conditions. Within countries, deaths are higher when strong winds are concentrated over areas of the country with elevated infant mortality rates, an indicator of institutional effectiveness through public service delivery. These results suggest that policies and programs to enhance institutional capacity and governance can support risk reduction from extreme weather events. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The feasibility of emergency uterine artery embolisation (UAE) after diagnosis by three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography (CTA) for conservative management of intractable haemorrhage associated with laparoscopic-assisted myomectomy (LAM) was evaluated. In 764 women undergoing LAM, 12 cases were managed by emergency UAE to achieve haemostasis after evaluation by CTA. In two cases, bleeding was diagnosed in the postoperative period, while, in another 10 cases, bleeding was identified at the near-end stage of the surgical procedure. Uterine preservation was achieved in all cases. Among five women desiring child bearing, five spontaneous conceptions and one conception by assisted reproductive technology occurred. Five pregnancies resulted in live birth by caesarean section. Emergency UAE could be a useful minimally invasive option for the salvage of intractable haemorrhage associated with LAM to avoid exploratory laparotomy and/or hysterectomy. In women with fertility wish, pregnancy outcomes were favourable with high number of spontaneous pregnancy rate and without significant negative effects.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Uterine myoma is the most common benign pelvic tumour in women. Myomectomy is indicated as the primary intervention for women with symptomatic myoma, who are of reproductive age and desire uterine preservation, since it can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life and, in some clinical situations, improve reproductive outcomes. Intractable haemorrhage associated with any forms of myomectomy is a potentially life-threatening condition with potential loss of future fertility. However, clear consensus on its management are not well known so far. What do the results of this study add? Emergency uterine artery embolisation after diagnosis by three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography has been effective in preserving the uterus with avoidance of laparotomy and/or life-saving hysterectomy as a salvage therapy for intractable haemorrhage associated with laparoscopic-assisted myomectomy. Significant adverse outcomes were not observed. Furthermore, in women desiring child bearing, a high rate of spontaneous conceptions with live birth by caesarean section was achieved after these combined interventions. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Endovascular embolisation could be considered as a minimally invasive alternative with favourable pregnancy outcome to treat intractable haemorrhage associated with myomectomy. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Both acute and chronic stress can cause allostatic overload, or long-term imbalance in mediators of homeostasis, that results in disruptions in the maternal-placental-fetal endocrine and immune system responses. During pregnancy, disruptions in homeostasis may increase the likelihood of preterm birth and preeclampsia. Expectant mothers traditionally have high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders, and many are susceptible to a variety of stressors during pregnancy. These common life stressors include financial concerns and relationship challenges and may be exacerbated by the biological, social, and psychological changes occurring during pregnancy. In addition, external stressors such as major weather events (eg, hurricanes, tornados, floods) and other global phenomena (eg, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) may contribute to stress during pregnancy. This review investigates recent literature published about the use of nonpharmacologic modalities for stress relief in pregnancy and examines the interplay between psychiatric diagnoses and stressors, with the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of implementing nonpharmacologic interventions as sole therapies or in conjunction with psychotherapy or psychiatric medication therapy. Further, the effectiveness of each nonpharmacologic therapy in reducing symptoms of maternal stress is reviewed. Mindfulness meditation and biofeedback have shown effectiveness in improving one's mental health, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety. Exercise, including yoga, may improve both depressive symptoms and birth outcomes. Expressive writing has successfully been applied postpartum and in response to pregnancy challenges. Although some of these nonpharmacologic interventions can be convenient and low cost, there is a trend toward inconsistent implementation of these modalities. Future investigations should focus on methods to increase ease of uptake, ensure each option is available at home, and provide a standardized way to evaluate whether combinations of different interventions may provide added benefit. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Every facility that provides obstetric service needs a certain level of preparedness to be able to handle at least Covid-suspect pregnant women awaiting test reports, who need to be managed as Covid-positive patients till reports are available. Thus, these facilities need to have triage areas and Covid-suspect labour rooms. Healthcare facilities can have designated areas for Covid-positive patients or have referral linkages with designated Covid-positive hospitals. Preparation includes structural reorganization with setting up a Covid-suspect and Covid-positive facility in adequate space, as well as extensive training of staff about infection control practices and rational use of personal protective equipment (PPE). A systematic approach involving five essential steps of making standard operating procedures, infrastructural reorganization for a triage area and a Covid-suspect labour ward, procurement of PPE, managing the personnel and instituting appropriate infection control practices can ensure uninterrupted services to patients without compromising the safety of healthcare providers. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

AB  - The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has had a rapid and deadly onset, spreading quickly throughout the world. Pregnant patients have had high mortality rates, perinatal losses, and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions from acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the past. Potentially, a surge of patients may require hospitalization and ICU care beyond the capacity of the health care system. This article is to provide institutional guidance on how to prepare an obstetric hospital service for a pandemic, mass casualty, or natural disaster by identifying a care model and resources for a large surge of critically ill pregnant patients over a short time. We recommend a series of protocols, education, and simulation training, with a structured and tiered approach to match the needs for the patients, for hospitals specialized in obstetrics. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

AB  - Ghost fishing in derelict blue crab traps is ubiquitous and causes incidental mortality which can be reduced by trap removal programs. In an effort to scale the benefits of such removal programs, in the context of restoring the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, this paper calculates the ecological benefits of trap removal by estimating the extent of derelict blue crab traps across Gulf of Mexico waterbodies and combining these estimates with Gulf-specific crab and finfish mortality rates due to ghost fishing. The highest numbers and densities of traps are found in Louisiana, with estimates ranging up to 203,000 derelict traps across the state and up to 41 traps per square kilometer in areas such as Terrebonne Bay. Mortality rates are estimated at 26 crabs per trap per year and 8 fish per trap per year. The results of this analysis indicate a Gulf-wide removal program targeting 10% of derelict traps over the course of 5 years would lead to a combined benefit of more than 691,000 kg of crabs and fish prevented from mortality in ghost fishing traps. These results emphasize the importance of ongoing derelict trap removal programs. Future work could assess additional benefits of trap removal programs, such as fewer entanglements of marine organisms, improved esthetics, and increases in harvestable catch. Lastly, this model could be utilized by fishery managers to calculate the benefits of other management options designed to decrease the extent and impact of derelict fishing gear. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The worst disaster of natural origin in recent Canadian history occurred in May 2016 in the northern Alberta community of Fort McMurray Wood Buffalo (FMWB). Among the 88,000 people abruptly evacuated amidst a raging wildfire were approximately 1850 pregnant or pre-conception women. Based on the Allostatic Load and Preterm Birth Conceptual Framework (Olson et al., 2015) [1], a simple, cost-effective expressive writing intervention following Pennebaker's work (Pennebaker and Beall, 1986; Pennebaker et al., 2007) [2,3] was implemented in a primary study to help mitigate the negative effects of stress on a sample of these women and their unborn children. Journal writing served as an intervention in the primary study while the contents of the journal entries became the data analyzed in this qualitative study. This study utilized both inductive and deductive thematic analysis of journal entries completed by 54 women over four consecutive days (15 min/day). Deductive analysis followed a coding structure that was generated from two resilience scales. Themes that emerged during inductive analysis were also coded. The main themes that emerged described the women's challenging experiences: fears for themselves and their offspring, fire-related and past trauma, and relationship changes. Resilience characteristics and practices also emerged from the writings and mirrored those found in the literature: (a) post-traumatic growth, (b) adaptability, (c) emotional/social connectedness, (d) composure, and (e) reasoning. This paper highlights the challenging experiences of pregnant women exposed to a disaster and the resilience they demonstrated in the face of the tragedy. © 2020

AB  - Global warming has increased the frequency of natural disasters, such as cyclones. Mozambique is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to extreme weather events. Natural disasters particularly affect vulnerable people, including preterm and critical ill infants of Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). Literature on NICU evacuations in the case of a natural disaster has been reported in high-resource settings, but it is lacking in low-resource settings. On the 14th of March 2019, a tropical cyclone (Idai) hit Mozambique. This report is a descriptive analysis of the experience of the NICU evacuation and care during and after cyclone Idai at Beira Central Hospital, Beira, Mozambique. © Copyright © 2020 Calgaro, Borellini, Seni, Tirzi, Gimo, Cebola, Putoto and Trevisanuto.

AB  - Wildfires have been affecting California greatly, and vulnerable patients in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are not exempt. Our aim was to learn how personnel working in NICUs of California hospitals handled issues of neonatal transfer during wildfire disasters in recent years, with an ultimate goal to share lessons learned with healthcare teams on disaster preparedness. We identified California fires through newspaper articles and the CalFire.gov list. We determined which hospitals were affected and contacted members of the healthcare team through connections via the California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative (CPQCC) database. We audio recorded interviews over phone or remote conferencing software or by written survey. We coded and analyzed transcripts and survey responses. While describing disaster preparedness, equipment (such as bassinets and backpacks), ambulance access/transport and documentation/charting were noted as important and essential. Teamwork, willingness to do other tasks that are not part of typical job descriptions, and unconventional strategies contribute to the success of keeping NICU babies safe when California wildfire strikes. Healthcare teams developed ingenious and surprising ways to evacuate NICU babies. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Forensic science, also known as Criminalistics is a field of science that uses science for investigation and its application in civil and criminal proceedings. One of the main challenges is to identify the dead during criminal and mass disaster investigations. Aim: The study aims to evaluate the morphometry of the orbital aperture and to verify its relationship with biological sex discrimination using three-dimensional Computed Tomography (3D CT). Study Design: This retrospective study involves 100 3D CT images of 50 males and 50 females (age 18-60 years). Materials and Methods: The exclusion criteria were congenital anomalies affecting the head and neck region, orbital fracture, systemic diseases affecting bone and head and neck tumor. Eight orbital parameters such as Orbital width, orbital height, orbital roof length, orbital floor-length, lateral orbital wall length, medial orbital wall length, intraorbital distance, and extra orbital distance were measured for all the 3D CT images using RadiAnt DICOM Viewer (64 bit). Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, and percentage distribution were calculated. Mann Whitney U-test assessed the comparison between groups. The linear regression equation and Wilk's lambda were also calculated for every parameter. Results: All the orbital measurements except for intraorbital distance were statistically significant between male and female subjects. Totally, 92.0% of the individuals were correctly classified. Conclusions: Orbital measurements were significantly larger in males than in females. Orbits exhibit the least dimensional change throughout one's life. Hence, it could be used as an adjunct in biological sex determination. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Humanitarian crises, driven by disasters, conflict, and disease epidemics, have profound effects on society, including on people’s health and well-being. Occurrences of conflict by state and nonstate actors have increased in the last 2 decades: by the end of 2018, an estimated 41.3 million internally displaced persons and 20.4 million refugees were reported worldwide, representing a 70% increase from 2010. Although public health response for people affected by humanitarian crisis has improved in the last 2 decades, health actors have made insufficient progress in the use of evidence-based interventions to reduce neonatal mortality. Indeed, on average, conflict-affected countries report higher neonatal mortality rates and lower coverage of key maternal and newborn health interventions compared with non–conflict-affected countries. As of 2018, 55.6% of countries with the highest neonatal mortality rate ($30 per 1000 live births) were affected by conflict and displacement. Systematic use of new evidence-based interventions requires the availability of a skilled health workforce and resources as well as commitment of health actors to implement interventions at scale. A review of the implementation of the Helping Babies Survive training program in 3 refugee responses and protracted conflict settings identify that this training is feasible, acceptable, and effective in improving health worker knowledge and competency and in changing newborn care practices at the primary care and hospital level. Ultimately, to improve neonatal survival, in addition to a trained health workforce, reliable supply and health information system, community engagement, financial support, and leadership with effective coordination, policy, and guidance are required. © © 2020 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - Objectives. To review the trends in pregnancy outcomes after Hurricane Katrina and assess effects of the disaster on research and public health related to pregnant women. Methods. We reexamined the 2004-2006 vital statistics data from Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, assessing what the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in the population would have been under varying risk scenarios. Results. We saw a reduction in number of births as well as in low birth weight and preterm birth. If the number of births had stayed constant and the relative higher risk in the “missing” births had been between 17% and 100%, the storm would have been associated with an increased risk instead of a decrease. Because the relative decline in births was larger in Black women, the higher risk in the “missing” births required to create a significant increase associated with the storm was generally not as great as for White women. Conclusions. Higher exposure to Katrina may have produced a reduction in births among high-risk women in the region rather than increasing adverse outcomes among those who did give birth. © 2020 American Public Health Association Inc..

AB  - Background: Sulphur mustard (HD) is a lipophilic caustic alkylating vesicant (blister agent) that has mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. Among the studied perturbations are long-term genitourinary (GU) and fertility effects. Approximately 50,000 Iranian soldiers and civilians were exposed to HD during the Iraq-Iran war (1980-1989). This study questioned the wives of Iraq-Iran war veterans to determine the effects of male HD-exposure on pregnancy complications, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and secondary infertility.Methods: A retrospective, survey-based cohort study was conducted of wives of Iranian military veterans that survived HD-associated injuries while serving in Ahvaz, Iran during the Iraq-Iran war (1980-1989), as compared to non-exposed veterans serving concomitantly. Patients were identified from a database of injured veterans maintained by the Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs (Iran) via a systematic random sampling method utilizing a random number table. Using a validated questionnaire, collected data included: Demographics; type and severity of chemical injury; spouse's obstetric history (pregnancy number, duration, complications, and outcomes before and after spouse's chemical injury); and secondary infertility.Results: An increase in spontaneous abortion (P =.03), congenital anomalies (P <.0001), and secondary infertility (P =.003) were observed. These findings were greatest amongst those with HD injuries affecting >50% body surface area. No difference in stillbirth, premature birth, or low birth weight was observed.Conclusion: Exposure to HD in combat may have long-lasting fertility effects on soldiers and their spouses, including spontaneous abortion, congenital anomalies, and secondary infertility. Further investigation is needed into the long-term effects of HD exposure as well as methods to better protect soldiers. © 2020 World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine.

AB  - In utero exposure to environmental stress in both animals and humans could result in long-term epigenome alterations which further lead to consequences for adaptation and development in the offspring. Epigenetics, especially DNA methylation, is considered one of the most widely studied and well-characterized mechanisms involved in the long-lasting effects of in utero stress exposure. In this review, we outlined evidence from animal and human prenatal research supporting the view that prenatal stress could lead to lasting, broad and functionally organized signatures in DNA methylation which, in turn, could mediate exposure-phenotype associations. We also emphasized the advantage of using stressor from quasi-randomly assigned experiments.

AB  - Background: The prolonged effects of disasters on reproductive outcomes among the survivors are less studied, and the findings are inconsistent. We examined the associations of maternal exposure to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake years before conception with adverse birth outcomes. Methods: We included 73,493 women who delivered in 96 hospitals in 24 provinces and autonomous regions from the 2015/16 China Labor and Delivery Survey. We weighted the multivariable logistic models based on the combination of coarsened exact matching (CEM) weight and survey weight, and performed sex-stratified analysis to test whether associations of maternal earthquake exposure with adverse birth outcomes (Stillbirth, preterm birth [PTB], low birthweight [LBW], and small for gestational age [SGA]) varied by sex. Results: The bivariate models showed that the weighted incidence of each adverse birth outcome was higher in exposed group than unexposed group: stillbirth (2.00% vs. 1.33%), PTB (14.14% vs. 7.32%), LBW (10.82% vs. 5.76%), and SGA (11.32% vs. 9.52%). The multivariable models showed maternal earthquake exposure was only associated significantly with a higher risk of PTB in offspring among all births (adjusted risk ratio [aRR](95%CI):1.25(1.06-1.48), P = 0.010). The sex-stratified analysis showed the association was significant among male births (aRR (95%CI): 1.40(1.12-1.75),P = 0.002),but unsignificant among female births. The sensitivity analysis reported similar findings. Conclusions: The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake exposure has a long-term effect on PTB. Maternal acute exposure to disasters could be a major monitor for long-term reproductive outcomes. More attention should be paid to the underlining reasons for disaster-related adverse birth outcomes. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Community-acquired acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) is the dominant form of AKI encountered in developing countries in Asia. Economic disparities, variations in access to health care services, geographic conditions, environmental risk factors, and sociocultural circumstances shape the causes and outcomes of CA-AKI. Infections, drugs, plant and chemical toxins, envenomations, and obstetric complications are common causes of CA-AKI. Previously healthy young individuals who often work outdoors in fields or farms are exposed to a wide variety of work-related or environmental risk factors for CA-AKI. Improving disease definitions, better data, and evolving host–pathogen interactions have changed disease descriptions and presentations over the past 20 years. Among infections, although the incidence of malaria has decreased, the number of cases with dengue and scrub typhus have increased sharply. The recognition of AKI in relation to Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium vivax, scrub typhus, and leptospirosis in areas not traditionally considered at risk, association of infections with the future development of chronic kidney disease, and the role of complement dysregulation in infection-associated AKI are important new findings. Snake-bite–related toxic envenomation continues to be an important cause of AKI in some counties and is a neglected public health problem. On the other hand, significant decreases in the incidence of AKI related to acute diarrheal illness or obstetric causes are signs of hope. Coordinated efforts between administrative stakeholders, society, and health care delivery services at all levels have the potential to propel research and improve outcomes in CA-AKI. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: To determine the association between oil pollution and miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant death in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was undertaken of pregnant women (aged 18–45 years) who attended selected health facilities in regions with high and low exposure to oil pollution from May 14, 2018, to September 27, 2018. A multistage sampling technique was used to randomly select a representative of women with high and low exposure to oil pollution. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed to adjust for confounding factors of miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant death. Results: In total, 1564 pregnant women were included in the study. Women with high exposure to oil pollution were more likely to experience stillbirth (odds ratio [OR] 1.806; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.177–2.770) and infant death (OR 2.162; 95% CI 1.409–3.317). However, after adjusting for potential confounders, only infant death was associated with high exposure (adjusted OR 1.843; 95% CI 1.146–2.962). No association was found between miscarriage and high exposure to oil pollution. Conclusion: Women with high exposure to oil pollution are at higher risk of infant death. © 2020 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics

AB  - Prior to Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico already had 200+ hazardous waste sites, significant contamination of water resources, and among the highest rates of preterm birth in the USA. To address these issues, the Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) Center was formed in 2010 to investigate prenatal environmental exposures, particularly phthalates, and adverse birth outcomes. Recent work from the PROTECT study confirms that in utero exposure to certain phthalates is associated with shorter gestation and increased risk of preterm birth. However, previous research also suggests that pregnant women who experience a natural disaster such as Hurricane Maria are at higher risk of adverse birth outcomes, but it is unknown whether this is due to stress, hazardous exposures, or a combination of factors. Thus, the aim of this analysis was to characterize hurricane-related changes in phthalate exposures and experiences within the PROTECT cohort. Among 176 participants who were pregnant during or within 5 months after Maria, 122 completed a questionnaire on hurricane-related experiences. Questionnaire results and biomarkers of exposure suggest that participants did not have regular access to fresh foods and water during hurricane recovery, and almost half reported structural damage to their home. In addition, biomarker concentrations of phthalates commonly used in food packaging were higher among participants post-hurricane, while phthalates commonly used in personal care products were lower compared to pre-hurricane levels. Hurricane-related increases in phthalate exposure, as well as widespread structural damage, food and water shortages, and long-term absence of electricity and cell phone service, likely increased the risk of adverse birth outcomes among this already vulnerable population. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - For centuries, scholars have wondered what daily life was like for the common people of Japan, especially for long bygone eras such as the ancient age (700-1150). Using the discipline of historical demography, William Wayne Farris shows that for most of this era, Japan's overall population hardly grew at all, hovering around six million for almost five hundred years. The reasons for the stable population were complex. Most importantly, Japan was caught up in an East Asian pandemic that killed both aristocrat and commoner in countless numbers every generation. These epidemics of smallpox, measles, mumps, and dysentery decimated the adult population, resulting in wide-ranging social and economic turmoil. Famine recurred about once every three years, leaving large proportions of the populace malnourished or dead. Ecological degradation of central Japan led to an increased incidence of drought and soil erosion. And war led soldiers to murder innocent bystanders in droves. Under these harsh conditions, agriculture suffered from high rates of field abandonment and poor technological development. Both farming and industry shifted increasingly to labor-saving technologies. With workers at a premium, wages rose. Traders shifted from the use of money to barter. Cities disappeared. The family was an amorphous entity, with women holding high status in a labor-short economy. Broken families and an appallingly high rate of infant mortality were also part of kinship patterns. The average family lived in a cold, drafty dwelling susceptible to fire, wore clothing made of scratchy hemp, consumed meals just barely adequate in the best of times, and suffered from a lack of sanitary conditions that increased the likelihood of disease outbreak. While life was harsh for almost all people from 700 to 1150, these experiences represented investments in human capital that would bear fruit during the medieval epoch (1150-1600). © 2009 by The Regents of the University of Michigan.

AB  - Thalidomide is amongst the most notorious drugs of all time. The majority of accounts of its distribution to the early 1960s focus on those countries where thalidomide caused the most extensive damage, most notably in economically developed countries. This article raises, however, questions about intended, explored, initiated or sometimes thwarted markets for thalidomide-containing preparations outside ‘the West’. It does so by focusing on Southern African markets for thalidomide, particularly those in Angola, Mozambique, (now) Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa. We place differences in the drug’s distribution channels in the context of the political economies of pharmaceuticals markets in the region in the decades after World War 2 and argue that colonial legacies and circuits of commerce can contribute to an understanding of why some regions ‘escaped a thalidomide disaster’. Finally, from late 1961 through 1962, we chart Southern African attempts to establish, or deny, the local presence of the teratogen. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Decades of population-based health outcomes data highlight the importance of understanding how environmental exposures in pregnancy affect maternal and neonatal outcomes. Animal model research and epidemiological studies have revealed that such exposures are able to alter fetal programming through stable changes in the epigenome, including altered DNA methylation patterns and histone modifications in the developing fetus and infant. It is similarly known that while microbes can biotransform environmental chemicals via conjugation and deconjugation, specific exposures can also alter the community profile and function of the human microbiome. In this review, we consider how alterations to the maternal and or fetal/infant microbiome through environmental exposures could directly and indirectly alter fetal programming. We highlight two specific environmental exposures, cadmium (Cd) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and outline their effects on the developing fetus and the perinatal (maternal and fetal/infant) microbiome. We further consider how chemical exposures in the setting of natural disasters may be of particular importance to environmental health. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Ionizing radiation and chemical pollution can disrupt normal embryonic development and lead to congenital malformations and fetal death. We used official government statistical data for 2000–2017 to test the hypothesis that radioactive and chemical pollutants influenced the frequency of de novo congenital malformations in newborns of the Bryansk region of southwest Russia. Methods: A variety of statistical approaches were used to assess congenital malformation frequencies including the Shapiro-Wilk test, White's homoscedasticity test, Wilcoxon T-test, Spearman's rank correlation test, and the inversely proportional regression. Results: We found that the frequency of polydactyly, multiple congenital malformations, and the frequency of de novo congenital malformations in newborns were significantly higher (p = 0.001–0.054) in regions with elevated radioactive, chemical and combined contamination. Polydactyly, multiple congenital malformations, and the sum of all congenital malformations were 4.7–7.4 times, 2.5–6.8 times, and 3.5–4.6 times higher in contaminated regions in comparison with the control group. The combination of both radioactive and chemical pollutants led to significantly higher frequencies of multiple congenital malformations when compared to regions with only one pollutant (radiation alone: 2.2 times, p = 0.034; chemical pollutants alone: 1.9 times, p = 0.008) implying that the effects of these stressors were at minimum additive. Although there was a trend for decreasing frequencies of multiple congenital malformations during the 2000–2017 period in areas of combined pollution, the opposite was true for regions with radioactive or chemical pollutants alone. However, overall, our models suggest that the frequency of multiple congenital malformations in areas of combined pollution will significantly (p = 0.027) exceed the frequencies observed for regions containing radioactive or chemical pollutants alone by 39.6% and 45.7% respectively, by 2018–2023.

AB  - Background: The fetal programming hypothesis suggests that prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) influences aspects of fetal development, such as the Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis, enhancing susceptibility to emotional problems. No study (to our knowledge) has investigated this pathway considering development of preschool anxiety symptoms. Using data from the Queensland Flood study (QF2011), our objective was to determine whether toddler HPA-axis functioning mediated the association between aspects of flood-related PNMS and child anxiety symptoms at 4-years, and whether relationships were moderated by the timing of the stressor in utero or by the child's sex. Methods: Women, pregnant during the 2011 Queensland floods (N = 230), were recruited soon afterwards and completed questionnaires regarding their objective hardship (e.g., loss of personal property), subjective distress (post-traumatic-like symptoms) and cognitive appraisal of the disaster. At 16 months, indexes of the child's diurnal cortisol rhythm (awakening response, total daily output, diurnal slope [N = 80]), and stress reactivity (N = 111), were obtained. At 4-years, N = 117 mothers reported on their own mood and their children's anxiety symptoms; of these, N = 80 also had valid child cortisol reactivity data, and N = 64 had diurnal cortisol rhythm data. Results: A greater cortisol awakening response at 16 months mediated the relationship between subjective PNMS and anxiety symptoms at 4-years. Greater toddler daily cortisol secretion predicted more anxiety symptoms, independent of PNMS. The laboratory stressor did not elicit a cortisol response. PNMS effects were not dependent upon child sex nor on gestational timing of flood exposure. Conclusions: Indexes of diurnal cortisol in toddlerhood may represent vulnerability for anxiety symptoms in preschoolers, both independent of, and following, exposure to disaster-related prenatal maternal subjective distress. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: NICU patients are disproportionately affected by any disaster due to their vulnerability and highly specialized care needs that require a multitude of resources. Research in disaster preparedness and its effect on NICU patients is limited. Study design: From March to May 2018, NICUs across California participated in a survey designed to assess their preparedness for a disaster. Results: Of the 84 responding units, 99% were urban, 73% were nonprofit, and 65% were community NICUs. As for NICU participation in hospital training exercises for disaster preparedness, 10% did not participate in annual drills, 44% did once a year, 36% did twice a year, and 10% did more than two times per year. Conclusion: We showed that many NICUs had redundant systems in place and plans for various disasters; however, there is not consistent participation by NICUs in hospital training exercises for disaster preparedness. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

AB  - Background: Infant birthweight is an important public health indicator that is a proxy of maternal and baby's health. Earthquakes can cause acute distress, but can also contribute to chronic stress through long-term disruptions to social, economic and domestic circumstances. The aims of this study were to examine the direct effect of earthquake experiences on the birthweight of infants of women who experienced the 2015 Nepal Earthquakes during pregnancy and whether mental health mediated this relationship. Methods: This is a prospective, population-based cohort study. Pregnant women in Bhaktapur District, Nepal who had experienced the 2015 earthquakes after conception were recruited. Baseline data were collected in structured individual interviews. Follow up was a short telephone interview two weeks after the baby's birth. Infant birthweight recorded on the hospital-issued birth certificate. The direct effect of earthquake experiences on birthweight and the indirect effect via antenatal common mental disorders (CMDs) were tested using Sobel tests simultaneously. Results: In total 497/498 women contributed baseline data and 469 (94.4%) women also provided the birth weight of their infants. In total 6% of infants had low birth weight (< 2.5 kg). The earthquake experiences did not have a significant direct effect on birthweight (p = 0.116). However, the effect of earthquake experiences had a significant indirect effect on infant birthweight via CMDs. When 15 covariates were controlled, women who had moderate to severe earthquake experiences had an increase of 1.58 scores of antenatal CMD symptoms that resulted in their babies being 20.50 g lighter than those who had low earthquake experiences (p = 0.026). Conclusions: The findings from this study indicate that the relationship is mediated by the mental health of women during pregnancy. Data demonstrate that the mental health of women who are pregnant should be prioritised in post-disaster management not only because of the burden experienced by women but also because of the risk for the growth and development of their babies. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Perinatal mortality increased in contaminated prefectures after the Fukushima Daichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accidents in Japan in 2011. Elevated counts of surgeries for cryptorchidism and congenital heart malformations were observed throughout Japan from 2012 onward. The thyroid cancer detection rate (2011 to 2016) was associated with the dose-rate at the municipality level in the Fukushima prefecture. Since the birth weight is a simple and objective indicator for gestational development and pregnancy outcome, the question arises whether the annual birth weight distribution was distorted in a dose-rate-dependent manner across Japan after Fukushima. Methods: The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare provides prefecture-specific annual counts for 26.158 million live births from 1995 to 2018, of which 2.366 million births (9.04%) with weights < 2500 g. Prefecture-specific spatiotemporal trends of the low birth weight proportions were analyzed. Logistic regression allowing for level-shifts from 2012 onward was employed to test whether those level-shifts were proportional to the prefecture-specific dose-rates derived from Cs-137 deposition in the 47 Japanese prefectures. Results: The overall trend of the low birth weight prevalence (LBWp) in Japan discloses a jump in 2012 with a jump odds ratio (OR) 1.020, 95%-confidence interval (1.003,1.037), p-value 0.0246. A logistic regression of LBWp on the additional dose-rate after the FDNPP accidents adjusted for prefecture-specific spatiotemporal base-line trends yields an OR per μSv/h of 1.098 (1.058, 1.139), p-value < 0.0001. Further adjusting the logistic regression for the annual population size and physician density of the prefectures, as well as for the counts of the dead, the missing, and the evacuees due to earthquake and tsunami (as surrogate measures for medical infrastructure and stress) yields an OR per μSv/h of 1.109 (1.032, 1.191), p-value 0.0046. Conclusions: This study shows increased low birth weight prevalence related to the Cs-137 deposition and the corresponding additional dose-rate in Japan from 2012 onward. Previous evidence suggesting compromised gestational development and pregnancy outcome under elevated environmental ionizing radiation exposure is corroborated. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - How quickly and in what ways are US maternity care practices changing due to the COVID-19 pandemic? Our data indicate that partners and doulas are being excluded from birthing rooms leaving mothers unsupported, while providers face lack of protective equipment and unclear guidelines. We investigate rapidly shifting protocols for in- and out-of-hospital births and the decision making behind them. We ask, will COVID-19 cause women, families, and providers to look at birthing in a different light? And will this pandemic offer a testing ground for future policy changes to generate effective maternity care amidst pandemics and other types of disasters?. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Nicobari pig is semi-feral, reared in free-range system with very low level of management. However, its population has been significantly reduced due to and after Tsunami in 2004. No systematic study has been conducted to explore the production potential of Nicobari pig. Therefore, a systematic comparison study was conducted between intensive and free-range system on growth and reproductive parameters in ICAR-CIARI, Port Blair. Reproductive parameters like age at first mating in male and age at first oestrus, oestrus cycle duration, oestrous duration, age at first mating, age at first farrowing, farrowing interval, litter size at farrowing and weaning, litter weight, still birth and mortality were recorded. Growth parameters like body weight at birth, at weaning and at months 3, 6 and 9 were recorded. Results revealed that significantly higher body weights at months 3, 6, 9 and 12 were recorded under intensive than in free-range system in male and female pigs and in male than in female. Non-significant differences was observed in the reproductive parameters in pigs between the two systems except parameters like oestrous cycle duration was higher and age at first mating, stillbirth and mortality were lower significantly in pigs under intensive system than in free range system. It was concluded that growth and reproductive performances of Nicobari pigs reared under intensive system has significantly higher beneficial than in free-range system. © 2020 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

AB  - Objective: To appraise and analyze published research on the relationships among hurricane exposure and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Data Sources: A literature search was conducted in four electronic databases: CINAHL Plus, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science. The following search terms were used: “cyclonic storms,” “cesarean section,” “premature birth,” “fetal mortality,” “low birth weight,” “infant mortality,” “pregnancy complications,” and “pregnancy outcome.” Study Selection: Documents were included if they were peer-reviewed, full-text articles or government documents published in English through February 2020 that focused on the associations among exposure to hurricanes and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. The initial search yielded 211 articles, and one article was identified through a hand search. After 48 duplicates were removed, we screened the titles and abstracts of 164 articles. We conducted a full-text review of 57 articles, and 19 articles were included in the integrative review. Data Extraction: We extracted data from the full text of each article into a standardized table with the following headings: author, year of publication, location, hurricane and year, population studied, study design, outcomes, data source, and results. Data Synthesis: We analyzed study findings based on the outcomes of pregnancy complications, preterm birth, cesarean birth, labor and birth complications, low birth weight, abnormal newborn conditions, and fetal mortality. We synthesized data in a narrative format, and the synthesis indicated that hurricane exposure was frequently associated with pregnancy complications, preterm birth, low birth weight, cesarean birth, and abnormal newborn conditions. However, these associations were not always consistent. Extant research is limited by inconsistency among study designs and the type of hurricane exposure. Conclusion: Interdisciplinary teams that include nurses, midwives, obstetricians and gynecologists, and other health care professionals should ensure that hurricane preparedness and response efforts specifically address the needs of pregnant women to mitigate adverse outcomes.; Hurricane exposure was associated with pregnancy complications, preterm birth, cesarean birth, labor and birth complications, and abnormal newborn conditions. © 2020 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses; © 2020 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses

AB  - Background: The public health impacts of tropical cyclones (TCs) are expected to increase due to the continued growth of coastal populations and the increasing severity of these events. However, the impact of TCs on pregnant women, a vulnerable population, remains largely unknown. We aimed to estimate the association between prenatal exposure to TCs and risk of preterm birth in the eastern United States (US) and to assess whether the association varies by individual- and area-level characteristics. Methods: We included data on 19,529,748 spontaneous singleton births from 1989 to 2002 across 378 US counties. In each county, we classified days as exposed to a TC when TC-associated peak sustained winds at the county's population-weighted center were >17.2 m/s (gale-force winds or greater). We defined preterm birth as births delivered prior to 37 completed weeks of gestation. We used distributed lag log-linear mixed-effects models to estimate the relative risk (RR) and absolute risk difference (ARD) for TC exposure by comparing preterm births occurring in TC-periods (from 2 days before to 30 days after the TC's closest approach to the county's population center) to matched non-TC periods. We conducted secondary analyses using other wind thresholds (12 m/s and 22 m/s) and other exposure metrics: county distance to storm track (30 km, 60 km, and 100 km) and cumulative rainfall within the county (75 mm, 100 mm, and 125 mm). Results: During the study period, there were 1,981,797 (10.1%) preterm births and 58 TCs that affected at least one US county on which we had birth data. The risk of preterm birth was positively associated with TC exposure defined as peak sustained wind speed >17.2 m/s (gale-force winds or greater) [RR: 1.01 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.03); ARD: 9 (95% CI: −7, 25) per 10,000 pregnancies], distance to storm track <60 km [RR: 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.04); ARD: 23 (95% CI: 9, 38) per 10,000 pregnancies], and cumulative rainfall >100 mm [RR: 1.04 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.06); ARD: 36 (95% CI: 16, 56) per 10,000 pregnancies]. Results were comparable when considering other wind, distance, or rain thresholds. The association was more pronounced among early preterm births and mothers living in more socially vulnerable counties but did not vary across strata of other hypothesized risk factors. Conclusions: Maternal exposure to TC was associated with a higher risk of preterm birth. Our findings provide initial evidence that severe storms may trigger preterm birth. © 2020

AB  - During conception (fusion of maternal and paternal germ cells) a new entity is formed, which has individual structure and functions. From its gene-pool (genome) epigenetic regulation selects those genes which are durably or acutely working, supplying a theoretically lifelong program. However, this program could be changed spontaneously or artificially, and there are life periods when the spontaneous changes are especially frequent and the sensitivity to physiological or artificial (man-made) factors is high. The basic sensitive (most vulnerable) period is the perinatal one, when the program agglomerated (and this is manifested in the faulty hormonal imprinting and DOHaD theories: perinatal adverse effects can cause diseases in adults), however, later periods are also sensitive. Such rather sensitive periods are the puberty and periadolescence as well as weaning, nevertheless, in any periods of life, cells or cell groups could be epigenetically imprinted, if the cells are in the state of differentiation, independent of the age or developmental state of the complete organism. Earlier mainly natural molecules (products of volcanic eruptions or phytoestrogens, mykotoxins, tobacco) threatened the program, today man-made artificial molecules (endocrine disruptors) can reprogram the visibly stable program, by a single encounter with hormone receptors at the periods of sensitivity (faulty hormonal imprinting) with life-long consequences (altered cell functions, inclination to diseases, manifestation of diseases, etc., provoked by functional teratogens). The deformed program is inherited to the offspring generations, where further program transformations are taking place on the inherited (transformed) program. As the amount and variants of man-made endocrine disruptors are enormously growing in the human environment and its important parts act during the developmentally most sensitive periods, the diseases provoked by them in adults expectedly will be enormously accruing. © 2020 Szerzõ(k).

AB  - This study investigates the determinants of fertility using a panel data set for 43 countries from 1900 to 2010 at five-year intervals. The regression results show that fertility increases with infant mortality and national disasters and decreases with total years of educational attainment and political development. Fertility rates fall initially and then rise with an increase in income. Average years of schooling of females has a significantly negative effect on fertility rates, whereas that of males are statistically insignificant. A woman's educational attainment at the primary and secondary levels has a pronounced negative effect on fertility rates. On the contrary, an increase in a woman's tertiary educational attainment, with the level of a man's remaining constant, tends to raise fertility rates, particularly in advanced countries, indicating that highly educated women can have a better environment for childrearing in a society with greater gender equality. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - There has long been anecdotal evidence of early labor and delivery in severe weather events leading to preterm birth. In particular, significant barometric pressure changes are associated with hurricanes and bomb cyclones. Some authors have related these low pressure weather events to premature rupture of fetal membranes, hypothesizing that the membranes act as an inflated balloon and respond directly to pressure changes. In this article, the key literature including data supporting this hypothesis is reviewed. A simple numerical model, based on a competition between the driving and resisting forces for fetal membrane rupture, is presented. This model provides a quantitative mechanism for membrane failure in the context of storms with low atmospheric pressure. Other sequelae of severe storms that are unrelated to fetal membrane rupture are also discussed. Labor and delivery in the context of major weather events should be understood in a holistic framework that includes both exogenous and endogenous factors relevant to the pregnant patient. © Copyright © 2020 Wheeler and Oyen.

AB  - December 21, 2018, marked the 30th anniversary of the Lockerbie Air Disaster. Despite this lengthy passage of time, the case remains highly contentious and active. A quick search on the topic reveals a host of possible conspiracy theories and cover-ups, many conflicting narratives and possibilities, and, for many, a strong feeling that the sentencing of Abdelbasset al-Megrahi represented a miscarriage of justice. While there have been many political books and articles on Lockerbie, surprisingly to date there have been no scholarly papers on its literary representations. This article, therefore, considers the ways in which the Lockerbie Air Disaster has been considered in fiction, drama, and poetry since 1988, surveying what has been published, as well as examining some of the motivations behind these. As will be demonstrated, some common threads run through these literary texts: namely, a frustration with the slowness of the ongoing criminal case and the perception that justice has still to be served. As will be demonstrated, many of the Lockerbie texts therefore contain inherent, politically charged provocations, sending out reminders that many aspects of the case have still to be accounted for in the public domain. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective: Preterm birth severely threatens neonatal health and life. Although the detailed mechanism of preterm birth is not well understood, accurately predicting preterm birth can help people make preparations in advance, greatly reducing the subsequent health risk of neonates. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to identify potential protein biomarkers of preterm birth in amniotic fluid (AF). Materials and methods: We first enrolled pregnant subjects and collected their AF samples when they underwent amniocentesis at the second trimester of gestation. After delivery, the collected AF samples were classified into a full-term birth (sample size n = 21) set or preterm birth (n = 36) set, followed by 2-D DIGE and MS/MS assays. Results: By doing so, we identified seven potential protein biomarkers of preterm birth, three of which were further validated in all samples with ELISA, including Apolipoprotein A-IV (Apoa4), Lumican (Lum) and Kininogen-1 (Kng1). As a result, all three potential biomarkers were significantly differently expressed between preterm and full-term birth AF samples. Furthermore, without prior classification, we found that these three biomarkers were positively correlated with gestation age (correlation coefficient ranging from 0.25 to 0.38) and were able to predict the occurrence of preterm birth. Conclusion: In this study, by examining amniotic fluid, we identified three biomarker proteins that may facilitate the identification of preterm birth. There three proteins were never reported to be related to preterm birth. Their pathogenesis roles in preterm birth deserve further investigations by using in vitro cell model or in vivo animal model assays. © 2020

AB  - Exposure to Criterion A traumatic events and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) have been associated with increased risk for parenting difficulties. Significant life stressors not considered to be Criterion A events, such as emotional abuse and neglect, may also increase the risk for parenting difficulties. However, research has not simultaneously investigated Criterion A events and non-Criterion A stressors in relation to indices of parenting. The current study examined whether both Criterion A and non-Criterion A events were associated with more negative parenting perceptions and lower levels of parental satisfaction, support, and involvement. The study also determined whether Criterion A and non-sCriterion A events remained related to parenting outcomes after accounting for PTSS among 243 parents (M<inf>age</inf> = 37.59; SD = 8.35; 61.6% female; 54.6% White). Non-Criterion A stressors were tied to more negative parenting-related perceptions of one’s partner and social relationships and lower levels of parental support (range βs = −.20 –.23). Even after controlling for PTSS, exposure to non-Criterion A stressors remained associated with more negative parenting-specific beliefs regarding one’s partner (β = −.17) and marginally to perceptions of relationships (β = −.13), yet were related to higher levels of parenting satisfaction and involvement (range βs = .18 –.21). Criterion A events were unrelated to parenting perceptions and behavior, irrespective of PTSS. Interestingly, non-Criterion A stressors may exhibit stronger ties to parenting difficulties than Criterion A events. Stressful life experiences, along with PTSS, may be important to address to improve parenting outcomes among stress-exposed parents. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Donated human milk is the best substitute for breast milk in the case when the mother cannot feed her baby. Human milk banks provide safe and high quality donated human milk. That was the reason why the Human Milk Bank was established in the Croatian Tissue and Cell Bank at the Zagreb University Hospital Centre in January 2020. The Bank works in accordance with the Law on the Application of Human Tissues and Cells. In this paper, we present the results of the Bank work since from its opening until June 2020. Due to logistic reasons caused by the COVID-19 epidemic and the earthquake in Zagreb, the Human Milk Bank did not collect milk for 43 days. Milk was donated by 31 mothers. Their median age was 31 years and 81% of them had high education level. In 52% of cases, mothers started donating milk three months after giving birth. Most donors donated milk only once (45%). The median period of donation was 46 days. The majority (52%) of donors gave birth for the first time, in the expected term of childbirth (94%), birth weight was >2500 g. Only three of donors’ children (9%) were in intensive care. A total of 175.5 L of milk were collected (mean 5.7 L per donor), of which 151.5 L met the requirements of input quality control, and 141 L were pasteurized. A critical number of viable aerobic and facultative bacteria were identified in 32.6% of milk pools prepared for pasteurization, and 8.9% after pasteurization. For clinical use, 78.7 L were dispensed in three neonatal intensive care units. The Human Milk Bank has already shown the importance of its activities during the first months of operation. In order to be able to meet the needs for donated human milk at the national level, it is necessary to constantly inform mothers about the importance of human milk and to promote its donation. © 2020 Croatian Paediatric Society.

AB  - Extreme climate events can have important consequences for the dynamics of natural populations, and severe droughts are predicted to become more common and intense due to climate change. We analysed infant mortality in relation to drought in two primate species (white-faced capuchins, Cebus capucinus imitator, and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi) in a tropical dry forest in northwestern Costa Rica. Our survival analyses combine several rare and valuable long-term datasets, including long-term primate lifehistory, landscape-scale fruit abundance, food-tree mortality, and climate conditions. Infant capuchins showed a threshold mortality response to drought, with exceptionally high mortality during a period of intense drought, but not during periods of moderate water shortage. By contrast, spider monkey females stopped reproducing during severe drought, and the mortality of infant spider monkeys peaked later during a period of low fruit abundance and high food-tree mortality linked to the drought. These divergent patterns implicate differing physiology, behaviour or associated factors in shaping species-specific drought responses. Our findings link predictions about the Earth's changing climate to environmental influences on primate mortality risk and thereby improve our understanding of how the increasing severity and frequency of droughts will affect the dynamics and conservation of wild primates. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: A cross-sectional study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of morbidities in communities residing at variable distances from the closed down insecticide manufacturing plant premises of Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL), Bhopal, India and to determine association of morbidities, if any, with their drinking water usage pattern and distance of localities from the UCIL plant. Materials and Methods: A total of 10,827 individuals belonging to 2,184 families, residing within 0-1 km (Stratum I) and 2.5-5.0 km (Stratum II) radial distances from UCIL plant were surveyed and 9,306 of them (86%) were clinically examined. Data were analyzed to examine the association between the groups of morbidities, likely due to biological and chemical water contamination, and the distance of locality from the UCIL plant. Multiple logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors for morbidities. Results: Nearly similar prevalence (25.3% in stratum I, 25.8% in stratum II) and the trend of all-cause morbidities were recorded in the two strata. While morbidities related to gastrointestinal tract system (P < 0.05), auditory system (P < 0.01), neoplasm/cancers (P < 0.01) and congenital anomalies (P < 0.01) were significantly higher in stratum I, the prevalence of hypertension (6.4% stratum II, 4.7% stratum I; P < 0.01) and diabetes mellitus (3.4% stratum II, 2.0% stratum I; P < 0.001) was found significantly higher in stratum II. No association (P > 0.05) was observed between the prevalence of morbidities, likely due to the consumption of biologically or chemically contaminated drinking water, and the distance of locality/stratum from the UCIL plant. Discussion and Conclusion: By and large similar pattern of morbidities were recorded in the two strata suggesting that the communities, irrespective of the distance of their residences from UCIL plant or sources of their drinking water, are equally vulnerable to various morbidities. © 2020 Journal of Postgraduate Medicine Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - There is evidence of a relationship between in utero exposure to catastrophic events and adverse birth outcomes, usually attributed to heightened maternal stress. The objective of our work was to evaluate if the breakage of a dam containing wastefrom a mining cite in Brazil, in 2015, an environmental disaster popularly known as the Mariana Tragedy, affected the health of newborns exposed in utero. We used administrative data on birth records and reports on the Mariana Tragedy to identify all births from newborns exposed in utero and the intensity of that exposure, according to the mother's municipality of residence. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we estimated the impact of different intensities of exposure on birth outcomes. We found that being directly exposed in utero to the Tragedy resulted in 1.86 days shorter gestational age and 2.6 percentage points higher incidence of preterm birth (<37 weeks). We found no impact on birthweight related outcomes. The effect is larger than previously identified for other catastrophic events. We hypothesize that this is probably due to the Tragedy impacting birth outcomes not exclusively through heightened maternal stress, but also through depressed economic activity in directly affected municipalities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Experimental Neurology
PY  - 2020
VL  - 326
AB  - Recordings from infants who died suddenly and unexpectedly demonstrate the occurrence of recurring apneas, ineffective gasping, and finally, failure to restore eupnea and arouse prior to death. Immunohistochemical and autoradiographic data demonstrate a constellation of serotonergic defects in the caudal raphe nuclei in infants who died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The purpose of this review is to synthesize what is known about adaptive responses of the infant to severely hypoxic conditions, which unleash a flood of neuromodulators that inhibit cardiorespiratory function, thermogenesis, and arousal and the emerging role of serotonin, which combats this cardiorespiratory inhibition to foster autoresuscitation, eupnea, and arousal to ensure survival following an hypoxic episode. The laryngeal and carotid body chemoreflexes are potent in newborns and infants, and both reflexes can induce apnea and bradycardia, which may be adaptive initially, but must be terminated if an infant is to survive. Serotonin has a unique ability to touch on each of the processes that may be required to recover from hypoxic reflex apnea: gasping, the restoration of heart rate and blood pressure, termination of apneas and, eventually, stimulation of eupnea and arousal. Recurrent apneic events, bradycardia, ineffective gasping and a failure to terminate apneas and restore eupnea are observed in animals harboring defects in the caudal serotonergic system models – all of these phenotypes are reminiscent of and compatible with the cardiorespiratory recordings made in infants who subsequently died of SIDS. The caudal serotonergic system provides an organized, multi-pronged defense against reflex cardiorespiratory inhibition and the hypoxia that accompanies prolonged apnea, bradycardia and hypotension, and any deficiency of caudal serotonergic function will increase the propensity for sudden unexplained infant death. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AU  - Waterson, P.
T2  - Applied Ergonomics
PY  - 2020
VL  - 84
AB  - This paper extends an earlier examination of the concept of ‘mesoergonomics’ (Karsh et al., 2014) and its application to Human Factors/Ergonomics (HFE). Karsh et al. (2014) developed a framework for mesoergonomic inquiry based on a set of steps and questions, the purpose of which was to encourage researchers to cross system levels in the studies (e.g., organisation-group-individual levels of analysis) and to explore alternative causal mechanisms and relationships within their data. The present paper further develops the framework and draws on previous work across a diverse range of sources (safety science, systems theory, the sociology of disaster and ethology) which has examined the subject of accident causation, levels of analysis and explanatory factors contributing to system failure. The outcomes from this exercise are a revised framework which seeks to explore what we term ‘isomorphisms’ and includes questions covering: (a) how internal isomorphisms develop or evolve within the system; and, (b) how these isomorphisms are shaped by cultural, professional and other forms of external influence. The workings of the revised framework are illustrated through using the example of the UK NHS Morecambe Bay Investigation (Kirkup, 2015). The paper concludes with a summary of ways forward for the framework, as well as new directions for theory within systems ergonomics/human factors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Children's bodies are in dynamic stages of development that make them more susceptible to harm from exposure to environmental agents. Children's physical, physiological and behavioral traits can lead to increased exposure to toxic chemicals or pathogens. In addition, the social determinants of health interact with this exposure and create an increasing risk for further disparities among children. In Indonesia, the fourth most populated country in the world, children are under threat of exposure to contaminated water, air, food and soil, which can cause gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases, birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders. A safe and balanced nutrition is still an unmet need for too many children. At the same time, the prevalence of obesity and the risk of later development of metabolic diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, are increasing as a consequence of both unhealthy diets and inadequate physical activity. The risks of potential long-term toxicity, including carcinogenic, neurotoxic, immunotoxic, genotoxic, endocrine-disrupting and allergenic effects of many chemicals, are also close to their lives. This paper provides an overview of common disease risks in Indonesian children, including: acute hepatitis A, diarrheal diseases, dengue and malaria due to lack of water supply and sanitation, vectors, and parasites; asthma, bronchopneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) due to air pollution and climate change; some chronic diseases caused by toxic and hazardous waste; and direct or indirect consequences due to the occurrence of disasters and health emergencies. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

Obstetric emergencies, including hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, HELLP syndrome, and amniotic fluid embolism, and anesthesia complications, including high neuraxial blockade, local anesthetic systemic toxicity, and the difficult obstetric airway, contribute to maternal cardiac arrest and maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Expeditious intervention by the obstetric anesthesiologist is critical in these emergent scenarios, and knowledge of best practices is essential to improve maternal and fetal outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Findings concerning the relationship between maternal prenatal and child cortisol concentrations are inconsistent. This study examined whether the influence of an objective traumatic stressor during pregnancy, distance from a natural flood disaster, moderated the association between prenatal maternal diurnal cortisol and 9-year old offspring hair cortisol concentrations. Methods: Data were collected from 56 of the mothers who took part in a study of flood-related pregnancy outcomes in 2009 and their children. Data included distance of the maternal home from evacuation areas, four maternal saliva cortisol assessments (waking, 30 min after waking, afternoon, and before bed) provided within 3-months of the flood crest and child hair samples to assess cortisol secretion over the past month. Results: There was a significant interaction between proximity to flooding during pregnancy and maternal cortisol AUC predicting child hair cortisol, after controlling for maternal age, gestational age at cortisol sampling, sex of the child, current socioeconomic status and current maternal stress. At greater distance from flooding (lower stress conditions) there was a non-statistically significant positive association between maternal cortisol and child cortisol. In contrast, living closer to flooding (higher stress conditions) produced a significant negative association between maternal and child cortisol. Conclusion: Experiencing a traumatic stressor during pregnancy may alter maternal-fetal programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The direct threat of flooding led to offspring cortisol concentrations that resembled cortisol production seen in mothers with symptoms of PTSD and their offspring. This alteration is evident in nine-year-old offspring and may help explain inconsistencies in the previous literature. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - On 14 June 2017 at 00:54 h, the worst residential fire since the conclusion of the Second World War broke out in Flat 16, 4th floor of the 24-storey residential Grenfell Tower Block of flats, North Kensington, West London, UK. Seventy-one adults and children died, including one stillbirth. All victims of the Grenfell Tower disaster who died at the scene underwent post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) imaging using a mortuary-sited mobile computed tomography scanner. For the first time, to the authors’ knowledge, the disaster victim identification (DVI) radiology reporting was undertaken remote to the mortuary scanning. Over an 11-week period, 119 scans were undertaken on 16 days, with up to 18 scans a day. These were delivered to a remote reporting centre at Leicester on 13 days with between 2 and 20 scans arriving each day. Using a disaster-specific process pathway, a team of 4 reporters, with 3 support staff members, trialled a prototype INTERPOL DVI radiology reporting form and produced full radiology reports and supporting image datasets such that they were able to provide 96% of prototype DVI forms, 99% of image datasets and 86% of preliminary reports to the DVI teams in London within one working day of image receipt. This paper describes the first use of remote radiology reporting for DVI and exemplifies how remote PMCT reporting can be used to support a DVI process of this scale. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Accruing epidemiological evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to emissions from cooking fuel is associated with increased risks of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, low birth weight, stillbirth and infant mortality. We aimed to investigate the relationship between cooking fuel use and various pregnancy related outcomes in a cohort of urban women from the Accra region of Ghana. Methods: Self-reported cooking fuel use was divided into "polluting" (wood, charcoal, crop residue and kerosene) and "clean" fuels (liquid petroleum gas and electricity) to examine 12 obstetric outcomes in a prospective cohort of pregnant women (N = 1010) recruited at < 17 weeks of gestation from Accra, Ghana. Logistic and multivariate linear regression analyses adjusted for BMI, maternal age, maternal education and socio-economic status asset index was conducted. Results: 34% (n = 279) of 819 women with outcome data available for analysis used polluting fuel as their main cooking fuel. Using polluting cooking fuels was associated with perinatal mortality (aOR: 7.6, 95%CI: 1.67-36.0) and an adverse Apgar score (< 7) at 5 min (aOR:3.83, 95%CI: (1.44-10.11). The other outcomes (miscarriage, post-partum hemorrhage, pre-Term birth, low birthweight, caesarian section, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, small for gestational age, and Apgar score at 1 min) had non-statistically significant findings. Conclusions: We report an increased likelihood of perinatal mortality, and adverse 5-min Apgar scores in association with polluting fuel use. Further research including details on extent of household fuel use exposure is recommended to better quantify the consequences of household fuel use.

AB  - Undoubtedly, menstrual pads have made menstruation hygienic and comfortable. However, these commercial disposable sanitary pads have a devastating effect on the environment and are eco disaster. This case discusses about an initiative taken by an Ahmedabad-based social enterprise and manufacturing company Saathi and founded by three Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduates -- Amrita Saigal, Grace Kane and Kristin Kagetsu. Their eco-friendly, biodegradable sanitary pad is an alternative to non-biodegradable commercial pads which when discarded ends up in sewage, landfills, fields and water bodies posing threat to environment. Moreover, this pad is also an alternative to commercial pads which are made of plastic, cellulose gel, laded with chemical, bleach and fragrance which leads to serious health issues including cervical cancer, urinary tract infection, infertility and birth defect. The present case of Saathi tries to surface out the relationship between sustainability and marketing by focusing on the concept of sustainability marketing. The case discusses the marketing mix strategy used by Saathi. In a country where menstruation is still a social taboo, the case also talks about the challenges faced by Saathi related to price, the environmental awareness and lack of knowledge about menstruation and ill effects of using commercial pads on women health and whether it should consider expansion of its business and enter into the B2C market in India. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: According to the World Health Organization, essential surgery should be recognized as an essential component of universal health coverage. In Ghana, insurance is associated with a reduction in maternal mortality and improved access to essential medications, but whether it eliminates financial barriers to surgery is unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that insurance protects surgical patients against financial catastrophe. Methods: We interviewed patients admitted to the general surgery wards of Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) between February 1, 2017 - October 1, 2017 to obtain demographic data, income, occupation, household expenditures, and insurance status. Surgical diagnoses and procedures, procedural fees, and anesthesia fees incurred were collected through chart review. The data were collected on a Qualtrics platform and analyzed in STATA version 14.1. Fisher exact and Student T-tests were used to compare the insured and uninsured groups. Threshold for financial catastrophe was defined as health costs that exceeded 10% of household expenditures, 40% of non-food expenditures, or 20% of the individual's income. Results: Among 196 enrolled patients, insured patients were slightly older [mean 49 years vs 40 years P < 0.05] and more of them were female [65% vs 41% p < 0.05]. Laparotomy (22.2%) was the most common surgical procedure for both groups. Depending on the definition, 58-87% of insured patients would face financial catastrophe, versus 83-98% of uninsured patients (all comparisons by definition were significant, p <.05). Conclusion: This study - the first to evaluate the impact of insurance on financial risk protection for surgical patients in Ghana - found that although insured patients were less likely than uninsured to face financial catastrophe as a result of their surgery, more than half of insured surgical patients treated at KBTH were not protected from financial catastrophe under the Ghana's national health insurance scheme due to out-of-pocket payments. Government-specific strategies to increase the proportion of cost covered and to enroll the uninsured is crucial to achieving universal health coverage inclusive of surgical care.

AB  - The thalidomide disaster of 1958 and later isotretinoin from 1995 showed that drugs do reach the foetus and can cause harm. Even now, of the babies born with a recognised birth defect, drugs are implicated in 1–2%. As a result, there is a perception that any drug at any time in pregnancy could cause harm; however, this is not the case! It’s important to consider the benefit to the mother, the risk to the foetus and the form of administration. This chapter discusses some of the most common drug classes and whether and when they can be safely used in pregnancy. © Cambridge University Press 2020.

The article presents the analysis of the work of air ambulance with respect to evacuation and providing emergency medical care to pregnant women according to the data of the Republican Center for Disaster Medicine for 2014–2019. Results. In 2014–2019, the evacuation of pregnant women by air ambulance takes the 3rd leading place every year. About 30 % of calls are maintained by air medical service from the Arctic regions of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The effectiveness of this work in the Arctic regions is undeniable: in recent years, infant mortality has been significantly reduced and no cases of maternal mortality have been registered. Conclusions: Routing and evacuation of pregnant women from the Arctic regions of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) led to a significant reduction in infant mortality and no cases of maternal mortality. © Burtseva T.E., Gogolev N.M., Sotnikov V.A., Douglas N.I., Ushnitskaya E.K., Borisova, E.A., Bulshy I.S., 2020.

AB  - Rangelands located in arid and semi-arid regions are particularly vulnerable to climate change. The objective of this research project is to assess vulnerability and its impacts on socio-economy of pastoral society and to formulate adaptation options for the selected rangelands. The analysis process consisted of (1) using geospatial techniques to assess the pastoral vulnerability; (2) using statistical correlation analysis to assess the impact of vulnerability on the grazing societies’ socio-economic conditions; (3) using qualitative document analysis (QDA) to evaluate policy documents; and (4) engaging in policy formulation, which included active participation by multiple academic researchers, policymakers, and representatives of the local community. The pastoral vulnerability assessment results reveal that drought, pasture usage and normalized difference vegetation index are the main drivers of vulnerability. Pastoral vulnerability increases the breeding stock’s miscarriage rate and causes livestock loss, which may affect the socio-economics of the herder community, devaluing herders’ labour and shortening their life expectancy. Two provinces’ policies were reviewed, and the findings suggest that aligning development and sectoral policies with climate change responses (i.e. adaptation and mitigation) to enhance the adaptive and transformative capacity of rural communities is important. The adaptation options and policy recommendations for two provinces are identified to enhance the resilience of livelihoods to climate change to potentially reduce vulnerability to anthropogenic climate change and advance development. © 2020, Asia-pacific Network for Global Change Research.

AB  - Adverse life experiences resulting from natural disaster, famine, war, or migration can have a lasting impact on maternal and child health. Maternal health can influence future generations through physiological and metabolic programming and epigenetic modifications. Moreover, prenatal and postnatal exposure to stress, trauma, environmental toxins, neglect, and violence can place future generations at an increased risk of behavioral, mental, and neurological disorders. Stress also is one of the most critical risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and fetal growth restriction. This impact can be attributed to programming of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and the chronic “wear and tear” on the body associated with high allostatic load. This chapter explores the consequences of maternal adverse experiences on mothers, their offspring, and future generations. We address the recent research in both animal models and human cohorts of stress and trauma. Finally, we discuss the importance of resiliency and suggest interventions as means to mitigate stress-associated negative health outcomes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) is a modern psychosomatic research field that can be seen as an empirical realization of the biopsychosocial model. PNI investigates the complex interplay between psychological factors and the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems and how it unfolds over the individual’s entire lifespan. One focus of PNI is the prenatal lifespan. Via the placenta and umbilical chord, the fetus is directly connected to the maternal organism (“feto-maternal interface”) and presents an immunological challenge to it. To ensure a healthy pregnancy, the mother’s immune system continuously adapts to the developing fetus. From a prenatal PNI perspective, it is therefore of interest how the mother experiences stress during pregnancy, either due to anxiety, depression, relationship conflicts, natural disaster, or other socially induced stressors (e.g., low socioeconomic status (SES), racial discrimination), at the neuroendocrine and immunological level and how stress impacts the fetus. Research demonstrates that lasting and/or massive stressors in pregnancy trigger changes in both the maternal and fetal stress system (i.e., increased cortisol, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and pro-inflammatory cytokines). These, in turn, can produce negative outcomes such as premature birth and low birth weight. Moreover, research shows that prenatal stress leaves epigenetic traces (e.g., NR3C1 methylation) in the child, which, through long-term dysregulations of the stress and immune system, favor the postnatal development of various diseases, such as allergies and autoimmune diseases. Overall, PNI clearly shows that the prenatal lifespan represents an important time window during which primary preventive measures have great potential to prevent long-term disease in the offspring, thereby promoting biopsychosocial health. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Increasing attention has been paid to the environment and experiences of the mother during pregnancy; consequently, prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) has become an important subject of research. Reviews on PNMS suggest that stress during pregnancy or preconception or maternal exposure to depression or adverse life events, including adverse childhood experience or chronic abuse, is associated with a host of negative pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation and gestational diabetes) and adverse developmental trajectories for the newborn, especially neurodevelopmental and metabolic, that include childhood and adult obesity, diabetes and neurodevelopmental impairments including anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, attention-deficient hyperactive disorder and even impaired adaptive immunity. Collectively these conditions, along with cardiovascular disorders (e.g., hypertension), cancer and others, are labelled non-communicable diseases. Modern-day stressors include high stress and post-traumatic stress syndrome, postnatal depression, maternal obesity, abuse at any time in life, natural disasters, conflict, poverty, famine, rapid urbanization and migration combined with historical stressors of colonialism in indigenous populations. The ability of a pregnant woman to cope with these stressors is dependent upon the levels and balance of her allostatic load and resilience. The risk for developing an adverse pregnancy outcome is a function of modifiable risk factors (e.g., clinical, individual or population level risk factors) and non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., genetics). A recent international program, OPERA (Optimal Pregnancy Environment Risk Assessment; www.operamtg.org), is attempting to develop simple tools in jurisdictions around the world for early detection of risk, thereby leading to early intervention and mitigation in order to improve newborn developmental trajectories. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Introduction. Maternal mortality (MS), as one of the integral indicators of the development of the maternity service, determines the quality of medical care. For each country and for each subject the structure of causes of MS may be different, requiring analysis of maternal deaths given the characteristics of the RF subjects that can become the basis for the development of more effective measures that predotvratit death. Objective. To analyze cases of MS in the Ural and Volga Federal districts with the subsequent development of an action plan to reduce maternal losses. Material and methods. The analysis of primary medical documentation of 10 deceased patients in the Ural and 16 in the Volga Federal districts for 2019 was carried out, and groups of defects in medical care were identified. Results. With an initially low MS indicator in the UFD in 2018, this indicator increased by 24.8% by the end of 2019. In the Volga Federal district in 2019, the MS indicator was reduced by 34.3%. A characteristic feature in both Federal districts among the causes of maternal disasters was the presence of septic complications in the top three. At the same time, the first place among the causes of MS in the UFD was occupied by bleeding (50.0%), and in the PFD extragenital diseases (31.25%). Attention is also drawn to the presence of obstetric embolisms in both Federal districts in every fifth woman. It should be noted the high share of medical care in group III institutions in the PFD (56.25%), in contrast to the UFD (36.4%). Among the defects in the provision of medical care in the UFD and PFD, the first place was occupied by medical defects. In the second place in the UFD — diagnostic and in the third — organizational and tactical. In half of the cases, they were associated with a violation of the routing of a high-risk group. Conclusions. In order to reduce maternal losses in the UFD and PFD, it is necessary to define tactical measures based on improving the routing of pregnant women, women in labor and women in labor at high risk in compliance with clinical recommendations and a unified analysis of critical obstetric conditions in the region. It is necessary to strengthen the work aimed at improving the skills of specialists with the development of manual skills, analysis of clinical situations, with the use of new educational technologies, taking into account the epidemiological situation in the country. © 2020, Media Sphera Publishing Group.

AB  - Bhopal was the site of the world’s worst industrial disaster, when on December 3, 1984, nearly 40 metric tons of methyl isocyanate (MIC) leaked from the Union Carbide pesticide plant and, being heavier than air, MIC settled on the ground. MIC is the smallest and most toxic of all isocyanates; it affected all life forms, killed nearly 8000 people within 48 hours by causing pulmonary edema, and produced lasting effects on more than 200, 000 residents. There is no antidote against MIC, although sodium thiosulfate was administered in the mistaken belief that the culprit chemical was hydrogen cyanide. Studies done on experimental animals after the accident largely confirm what was observed on the Bhopal population. Nearly 40% of women pregnant at the time of the disaster lost their fetuses. Chronic effects include pulmonary, gynecological, ocular, neurological, and other complications. MIC metabolites are also toxic and some, like trimethylamine, exert selective toxicity on male progeny. Large quantities of highly toxic chemical waste stored in the factory premises have contaminated the soil and water. The Bhopal disaster revealed dangers inherent in chemical industries and the need for stringent regulations and supervision to ensure safety. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), a contagious disease, is a global pandemic affecting the lives and health of individuals across borders, genders and races. Much of what is known about the effects of natural disasters and disease outbreaks on women's health in particular, is based on studies conducted in high-income countries. The evolving evidence suggests that COVID-19 has a profound negative impact on the perinatal mental health of women. It is also clear that global pandemics such as COVID-19 disproportionately affect the less affluent, including individuals living in low- and middle-income countries. The purpose of this review is to summarize and critically discuss extant knowledge on COVID-19 as it relates to the perinatal health of women in low and middle-income countries, using Pakistan as a case example. We specifically highlight the effects on perinatal mental health, preterm birth, and timing of the COVID-19 exposure. Our review suggests that it is essential to consider the effects of COVID-19 within this cultural context and that findings from high-income countries do not necessarily translate to the situation in low and middle-income countries. © © 2020 Premji, Shaikh, Lalani, Yim, Moore, Ali, Aijaz and Letourneau.

AB  - Reproductive performance is one of the most important economic traits in beef or dairy production. The majority (60%) of Somalis are pastoral nomads and engage livestock production for livelihood, employment and income. Recurrent droughts and diseases are discouraging the pastoral production systems and forcing some pastoralists and diaspora to adopt small scale dairy production. Measuring the reproductive efficiency of dairy production in Somalia is paramount and deemed necessary. Therefore, an assessment was launched to assess factors that affect reproductive performance and understand the breeding regularity of local cattle breeds in Benadir region. This study was cross sectional and took place from Feb. 2018 to Feb. 2019. The study used both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. A total of 100 respondents were interviewed to collect qualitative data while a total of 2916 cattle were examined to gather quantitative data. The overall estimated means for age at puberty (AP), age at first calving (AFC) and calving interval (CI) was: 37.9 months, 49.2 months, and 19.15 months respectively. The percentage of cows weaned live calf was 57.6%. The average milk yield of local breeds is estimated to be 8 liters per day with average lactation period of 7.7 months. In calves, the average birth weight, weaning weight, maturity weight was 15.22 kg, 156.3 kg, and 310.28 kg respectively. The fertility rate was also measured and it was found that the average conception rate to be 18%, a general fertility of 53.85%, a dystocia rate of 5.6%. Heredity, nutritional stress and diseases appeared to be the main problems causing low reproductive efficiency in the study area. Other challenges in cattle production in the area were low inputs and poor facilities. Therefore, it is recommendable that short trainings and appropriate technology transfer in delivering animal husbandry practice and basic veterinary services to small holder farmers in Benadir region. © 2020 Hassan et al.

AB  - Water is indispensable element that is needed for survival of life on earth. However, increasing competition toward water sources as a result of agricultural, industrial, as well as domestic users has resulted into sharp increase in stress on aquatic as well as wetland ecosystems. In addition, prominent climatic changes and natural disasters along with prolonged drought conditions also contribute toward worldwide clean water scarcity. It is being polluted by several toxic contaminants as well as industrial effluents mainly due to anthropogenic activities including population explosion. Even in current scenario, it is found that more than one billion people failed to get safe as well as reasonable drinking water. Insufficient drinking water quality is a foremost reason for global infant mortality. Also, food production might be severely decreased in the near future as a result of insufficient water availability. Thus, providing clean water at affordable price for the present and upcoming generations of the twenty-first century is a major challenge. In this context, there is an urgent need of nanotechnology-based innovative technologies for wastewater treatment over traditional ones. Overall, the present chapter summarizes the causes of contaminations of water resources together with the most recent innovative strategy for wastewater treatment using nanoparticles. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Assessing the resilience of Awassi sheep to water shortages during pregnancy, thereby investigating the effects of water scarcity on gestation efficiency in animals, could provide valuable and pertinent insight into future scenarios posed by climate change risks. In this study, 40 pregnant Awassi ewes randomly allocated to free watering group (C, n = 20) received water ad libitum and the water restricted group (WR) received 50% less water than the amount provided to group C. Water restriction decreased (p <.05) lambs’ birth weights, placental weights (PWs), and cotyledon numbers (CNs). Placental efficiency (PE) and cotyledon efficiency (CE) were significantly higher in the WR group (p <.05). A marked difference in cotyledon weight – an increase of 12.1% – was recorded in the C group. The body weights of the pregnant ewes in the WR group decreased significantly (p <.05) by 22% during pregnancy. Significant increases (p <.05) in plasma ADH, cholesterol, Cl−, and Na+ levels were observed in the WR group ewes, indicating intense dehydration. We conclude that the Awassi breed of sheep can endure 50% water restriction during pregnancy and maintain successful parturition, a key outcome for sustainability. © 2020 Japanese Society of Animal Science

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: Of the work was to study 25-year trends in the incidence of congenital anomalies in the child population of Ukraine in order to determine the impact of ecotoxic environmental factors on their development, in particular radiation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: Methods of statistical assessment, epidemiological analysis of materials at the Center for Medical Statistics of the MOH of Ukraine were used. RESULTS: Results: The rate of congenital anomalies growth for the recent 25 years has exceeded the growth rate of the total incidence in the child population of Ukraine by 1.6 times, occupying the leading place in Europe by the level of environment pollution. Over the last 25 years, the growth of the Ukrainian children's congenital anomalies incidence level by 59.5% is observed, mostly in children from large industrial regions of Ukraine, due to the significant ecotoxic effect of pollutants on the child's body. Children living permanently in the areas contaminated by the Chernobyl accident had significantly higher rates of congenital anomalies in 1986 than in the early 1990s, but over the recent 25 years the incidence in this contingent has decreased. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The results of such long-term studies performed by a group of leading Ukrainian scientists from different regions of Ukraine indicate that in children experiencing negative effects of ecotoxic factors, including radiation, an increase in the detection and prevalence of congenital defects is observed, which requires complex international and intersectoral measures to prevent and reduce child mortality.

AB  - Purpose of the study. Based on the official statistics for 1999-2014, we carried out a comparative analysis of the incidence of congenital brain malformations in children resided in the radiation-contaminated areas of the Bryansk region after the Chernobyl disaster with different densities of Cesium-137 and Strontium-90. Material and Methods. Student's t-test, Pearson chi-square test, Pearson correlation test, linear regression. Results. As a result of the study, no statistically significant excess in the frequency of anencephaly, hydrocephalus and encephalocele in children in more radiation-contaminated south-western territories (SWT) was found compared to the average regional data. However, in the SWT, the prevalence of microcephaly is statistically significant (p<0,05) above the average regional values (5.8 times). While the maximum values are recorded in the most radioactively polluted areas of the region when high statistically significant correlations are detected with the density of radioactive contamination with Cesium-137 (r=0.69; p=0.040) and Strontium 90 (r=0.70; p=0.037), while there are no significant dependencies for other brain defects of the brain. A statistically significant decrease in the long-term trend in the prevalence of microcephaly throughout the region without SWT in the period 1999-2014, and an increase in the radiation-contaminated SWT, was found. Conclusions. The results obtained presumably indicate to the influence of the radiation factor on the increased incidence of microcephaly in SWT relative to the average regional values without SWT for a sixteen-year period (1999-2014). The further studies are needed to analyze the incidence of various types of congenital malformations in order to determine a strategy for preventing birth of children with congenital anomalies. © 2020 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

AB  - Water is turning to be scarce in many countries in the world, in the 21st century, caused by an increase in its demand due to population growth, increased food production and higher energy consumption, linked to a temporary climate variation. Governments must establish water security programs by planning the management of water resources, as a paradigm shift. Mexico is not the exception, a country of strong meteorological, hydrographic and social contrasts throughout its territory, which impact in different ways the population strata, similar to other developing countries. In this context, hazard, social vulnerability and risk indices are proposed and quantified in this paper, through a probabilistic methodology for calculating water security. Hazard is expressed by basic water services shortage, floods, groundwater depletion, and drought indicators. In turn, the vulnerability considers educational level of the population, access to health services, infant mortality rate, illiteracy, housing conditions, unemployment and proportion of indigenous language population. In the development of this study it is shown that both hazard and vulnerability throughout the Mexican territory are very heterogeneous. The proposed probabilistic methodology was implemented in a Geographical Information System obtaining water security indices for all municipalities in Mexico (2 456 municipalities). © 2020 Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia del Agua.

AB  - The devastating effects of natural hazards uncover and exacerbate social inequalities, yet reproductive health outcomes are often overlooked. Despite a small but growing literature on gender and disaster-related impacts, there are no studies to date to our knowledge on the intersection of abortion and disasters, which is important because abortion is common in the U.S. and is a critical component of comprehensive reproductive healthcare yet is routinely inaccessible due to a lack of health insurance coverage and other policy barriers. This is a qualitative case study of 8 individuals who required abortion services in Texas at the time of Hurricane Harvey. The study sample comes from caller data from a local Texas abortion fund. We present caller demographics, which reveal nonwhite patients in later trimesters struggling economically. Callers display a need for funding, particularly for travel, and were affected by interpersonal and sexual violence. We conclude with policy and research implications for disaster planners, domestic violence organizations, state and federal officials, and health insurers. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Introduction. Congenital heart defects (CHD) with perinatal pathologic conditions and diseases of the respiratory organs are currently occupying the leading places among the causes of infant mortality and disability in Ukraine and worldwide. Purpose. Study of the morbidity of the pediatric population of the country and the prevalence of congenital heart defects in children from the areas with radiological control territories (TRC) and other regions of Ukraine in the dynamics over the last 24 years. Our goal is to identify unfavorable trends and to develope the measures to protect the infant organism from adverse environmental factors, including radiation. Materials and methods. We performed the analysis of the incidence and prevalence of congenital heart defects among children from different regions of Ukraine, including those contaminated after the Chernobyl accident. The methods of statistical evaluation, epidemiological analysis of materials of the Center of Medical Statistics of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine were used. Results and discussion. The rate of growth of the incidence of congenital heart disease in the last 24 years exceeded by 5.3 times the indicator of the overall morbidity of the pediatric population of Ukraine. Thus, the increase of CHD morbidity rates in the last 24 years among children from the regions with radiological control territories was higher (+218.0%) than among children from other regions of the country (+179.2%) and higher than national incidence of children with congenital heart defects (+190.0%). The number of CHD among children affected by the Chernobyl accident was slightly lower than in other groups (+73.9%). In all 9 regions with radiological control territories, a high incidence of pediatric congenital heart disease has been observed and maintained over the last 24 years. This rate is higher by 26.1% than the corresponding incidence of CHD among children living in the areas without radiological control territories and higher by 15.9% than nationwide morbidity. At the same time, the incidence of CHD morbidity among the children affected by the Chernobyl disaster was slightly lower than the national incidence rate. Conclusion. The results of our observations let to conclude that the embryonic period of ontogenesis of the cardiovascular system of children is sensitive to prolonged exposure to ecotoxic environmental factors, including radiation. © 2020, Professionalnye Izdaniya.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has posed multiple substantial challenges, affecting not only public health but also economic systems, socio-cultural patterns, and political institutions. Studies have focused on the relationships between complex emergencies and natural disasters with outbreaks of infectious diseases. However, there is a dearth of relevant literature on the impact of a global pandemic on vaccination programs–an important topic because delays or stops in such programs are likely to result in outbreaks and epidemics of other infectious diseases. Thus, this article discusses the negative and positive impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic may exert on vaccination for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Negative impacts include the increased risk of VPD outbreaks in low-resource countries where vaccination programs must be temporarily halted to prevent the spread of infection. Positive effects include the strong possibility that the universally-recognized need for a coronavirus vaccine may increase people’s appreciation for vaccines in general, resulting in improved vaccination uptake once the pandemic passes. Concerned stakeholders, such as governments and the World Health Organization (WHO), should seize this moment to effectively build on these positive impacts by planning renewed and revitalized post-COVID vaccination programs. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We describe the strengths and challenges of the child healthcare system in Hungary. The number of children has been steadily decreasing since 1982. The number of live births per thousand population has decreased from 12.1 to 9.3 between 1990 and 2015. In 2015, the infant mortality rate was 4.2 deaths per 1000 live births, the lowest ever recorded in Hungary. In 2012, 96% of infants were ever breastfed, following the guidelines, and 65% were exclusively breastfed. Vaccine coverage is over 99%. Primary care paediatricians provide primary healthcare for children under the age of 18 years. There is a special pediatric and a special preterm new-born transport system. The network of Neonatal Intensive Care Units within Hungary was set up in 1975, with the participation of 10 Neonatal Intensive Care Units. In 2015, there were 206,507 inpatient hospital ad-missions for children aged 0–18 years to acute hospitals. Acute pediatrics is mainly provided in pediatric departments in general hospitals with inpatient and outpatient care. After finishing medical university, there is a 5-year period of postgraduate pediatric training in certified hospitals and university pediatric departments. Hungary’s healthcare system is on the brink of disaster. Low salaries and poor working conditions force physicians to either go abroad or work at a private institutions. Hungary will face a major shortage of paediatricians within ten years. The aver-age age of paediatricians in Hungary is 59, 46% of whom are age over 60 years. Several efforts are being made to solve this complex problem. © 2020 by Turkish Pediatric Association-.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the many factors regarding socioeconomic and healthcare-related variables linked to maternal diseases and the possible impact of the environmental disaster of Mariana, given the prenatal exposure to different water sources for human consumption that were associated with low birthweight in full-term live births in the Municipal Hospital of Governador Valadares, Minas Gerais. METHODS: Case-control study, carried out with live births at the Municipal Hospital of Governador Valadares, from May 2017 to July 2018. The case group consisted of full-term live births and low birthweight, and the control group consisted of full-term live births with adequate weight, matched by gender and date of birth. For each case, two controls were selected. Data collection was performed through interviews with the puerperal women, and complementary information was obtained by analyzing the prenatal card and medical records. For data analysis, logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: The study included 65 live births from the case group and 130 from the control group. After the analysis was adjusted for other factors under study, we found that the higher risks of low birthweight are associated with the first childbirth (OR = 2.033; 95%CI = 1.047-3.948; p = 0.036), smoking during pregnancy (OR = 2.850; 95%CI = 1.013-8.021; p = 0.047) and consumption of water supplied by the municipalities affected by the tailings from the Fundao dam failure (RC = 2.444; 95%CI = 1.203-4.965; p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The variables "water consumed during pregnancy, " "previous pregnancies" and "maternal smoking" were associated with low birthweight in the population studied. The importance of epidemiological studies that assess water quality and its adverse health effects is reinforced, as well as greater prenatal control of first-time pregnant women and greater support of policies against smoking, especially during pregnancy. © 2020, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

AB  - The impact of stress on brain health begins in the womb. Both animal and human studies have found that prenatal maternal stress affects the brain and behavior of the offspring. Stressful life events, exposure to a natural disaster, and symptoms of maternal anxiety and depression increase the risk for the child having a range of emotional, behavioral and/or cognitive problems in later life. These include depression, anxiety, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and/or conduct disorders. There is an increased risk for other outcomes also, including preterm delivery and reduced telomere length, possibly indicative of an accelerated life history. The causal role of prenatal maternal stress on the etiology of the neurodevelopmental disorders is supported by large population cohorts, which have controlled for a wide range of potential confounders, including postnatal maternal mood. More recently, research has begun to explore the biological correlates and mediators of these findings. These studies suggest that the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis plays a role in mediating the effects of maternal stress on the fetal brain. Further, in vivo brain imaging research reports that maternal stress is associated with changes in limbic and frontotemporal networks, and the functional and microstructural connections linking them. The structural changes include cortical thinning and an enlarged amygdala. While these studies have been conducted on smaller sample sizes and could not control for many confounders, the observed brain changes do plausibly underlie many of the emotional, behavioral and cognitive changes found to be associated with prenatal stress. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We have updated our work regarding climate extremes in Japan and the consequences of the huge earthquake in the Fukushima Prefecture in year 2011. We have interchangeably used the term sex ratio at birth, sex ratio of births. This ratio describes the secondary sex ratio, whereas the primary sex ratio designates the male/female ratio at fertilization. The underlying mechanisms of declines in sex ratios at birth may be related to decreased fertilization of XY embryos by reduced motility of Y spermatozoa from male factor approach and increased cortisol secretion prior to conception from a female factor approach. We have shown that the declines in sex ratio at birth were observed 9 months after the Kobe earthquake but 10 months after the Tohoku and Kumamoto earthquakes. The temperature difference may be associated positively with sex ratio of fetal deaths and negatively with sex ratio of births and with singleton male and female birth weights. © 2019

AB  - We study whether exposure to earthquake affects health at birth. A mother-fixed-effect model together with the spatiotemporal variation of earthquakes in Chile allow us to better estimate the impacts on birth outcomes. Our findings show that exposure to earthquakes affects fetal growth. Infants born to mothers exposed to earthquakes in the second trimester are 1.8% more likely to be large for gestational age (LGA), which is a large effect from a baseline of 7% of LGA newborns. The reported impact varies across mothers’ socioeconomic status, with relatively poorer Chilean mothers being more vulnerable to earthquakes. A possible mechanism that explains these results could work through changes in the incidence of women with diabetes. We provide indirect evidence in this regard. Mothers with diabetes are more likely to have large-for-gestational-age babies. Exposure to earthquakes increases the incidence of diabetes among the affected population, with the observed impact on diabetes being relatively higher among women of lower socioeconomic status. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Under the bridges of Paris flows the Seine and, under one of them, the Alma Bridge; one can see the last sculpture of one of the soldiers of the Crimean War, dressed in zouave. This sculpture, well known to Parisians, serves as a flood indicator, admittedly imprecise, but an indicator nonetheless. Compulsory education laws have, in Spain and throughout the world, created a considerable demographic gap. Indeed, almost the entire age group is kept within the “school net” during the period of compulsory schooling in States with very high universal coverage of education. Birth defects account for 20–25% of total perinatal mortality, and are the leading cause of perinatal mortality in Spain. Spain is one of the countries in the world where prenatal screening and diagnosis are the most developed. The evolution of the causes of anomalies potentially due to the environment requires comprehensive birth surveillance. © ISTE Ltd 2020.

AB  - This study explored the community perception of maternal deaths influenced by natural disaster (flood), and the practice of maternal complications during natural disaster among the rural population in Bangladesh. It also explored the challenges faced by the community for providing healthcare and referring the pregnant women experiencing complications during flood disaster. Three focus group discussions (FGDs) and eight in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted in the marginalized rural communities in the flood-prone Khaliajhuri sub-district, Netrakona district, Bangladesh. Flood is one of the major risk factors for influencing maternal death. Pregnant women seriously suffer from maternal complications, lack of antenatal checkup, and lack of doctors during flooding. During the time of delivery, it is difficult to find a skilled attendant, and referring the patient with delivery complications to the healthcare facility. Boats are the only mode of transport. The majority of maternal deaths occur on the boats during transfer from the community to the hospital. Rural people feel that the maternal deaths influenced by natural disaster are natural phenomena. Pre-preparation is needed to support pregnant women during disasters. There is unawareness of maternal health, related care, and complications during disasters among local health service providers and volunteers. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The probability of extreme weather events is increasing, with the potential for widespread impacts to plants, plant communities, and ecosystems. Reports of drought-related tree mortality are becoming more frequent, and there is increasing evidence that drought accompanied by high temperatures is especially detrimental. Simultaneously, extreme large precipitation events have become more frequent over the past century. Water-limited ecosystems may be more vulnerable to these extreme events than other ecosystems, especially when pushed outside of their historical range of variability. However, drought-related mortality of shrubs—an important component of dryland vegetation—remains understudied relative to tree mortality. In 2014, a landscape-scale die-off of the widespread shrub, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.), was reported in southwest Wyoming, following extreme hot and dry conditions in 2012 and extremely high precipitation in September of 2013. Here we examine how severe drought, extreme precipitation, soil texture and salinity, and shrub-stand characteristics contributed to this die-off event. At 98 plots within and around the die-off, we quantified big sagebrush mortality, characterized soil texture and salinity, and simulated soil-water conditions from 1916 to 2016 using an ecosystem water-balance model. We found that the extreme weather conditions alone did not explain patterns of big sagebrush mortality and did not result in extreme (historically unprecedented) soil-water conditions during the drought. Instead, plots with chronically dry soil conditions experienced greatest mortality following the global change–type (hot) drought in 2012. Furthermore, mortality was greater in locations with high potential run-on and low potential run-off where saturated soil conditions were simulated in September 2013, suggesting that extreme precipitation also played an important role in the die-off in these locations. In locations where drought alone contributed to mortality, stem density negatively impacted big sagebrush. In locations that may have been affected by both drought and saturation, however, mortality was greatest where stem density was lowest, suggesting that these locations may have already been less favorable to big sagebrush. Paradoxically, vulnerability to both extreme events (drought and saturation) was associated with finer-textured soils, and our results highlight the importance of soils in determining local variation of the vulnerability of dryland plants to extreme events. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - We conduct the first empirical study to examine the health impact of long commutes to work during pregnancy on fetuses and infants at birth, using unique data that contain information on not only a woman's home address but also her employer's address during pregnancy, which allows us to calculate the maternal travel distance during pregnancy. Our study contributes to the literature on the relationship between maternal stress during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes by focusing on the understudied chronic stress induced by long commutes, rather than the stress triggered by a one-time significant event, such as a natural disaster. We find that among long-distance commuters, increasing the maternal travel distance during pregnancy by 10 miles is associated with increases in the probabilities of low birth weight and intrauterine growth restriction by 0.9 and 0.6 percentage points, respectively. In addition to the maternal stress induced by long commutes being one potential biological mechanism, we find suggestive evidence showing that maternal long commutes during pregnancy are also associated with under-utilization of prenatal care. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The adverse impacts of climate change exert mounting pressure on agriculture-dependent livelihoods of many developing and developed nations. However, integrated and spatially specific vulnerability assessments in less-developed countries like Bangladesh are rare, and insufficient to support the decision-making needed for climate-change resilience. Here, we develop an agricultural livelihood vulnerability index (ALVI) and an integrated approach, allowing for (i) mapping out the hot spots of vulnerability distribution; (ii) identifying key factors of spatially heterogeneous vulnerability; and (iii) supporting intervention planning for adaptation. This study conceptualized vulnerability as a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity by developing a composite index from a reliable dataset of 64 indicators comprising biophysical, agro-ecological, and socioeconomic variables. The empirical studies of coastal Bangladesh revealed that Bhola, Patuakhali, and Lakshmipur districts, around the mouth of the deltaic Meghna estuaries, are the hot spot of vulnerability distribution. Furthermore, the spatially heterogeneous vulnerability was triggered by spatial variation of erosion, cyclones, drought, rain-fed agriculture, land degradation, soil phosphorus, crop productivity, sanitation and housing condition, infant mortality, emergency shelters, adoption of agro-technology. The integrated approach could be useful for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation intervention by substituting various hypothetical scenarios into the ALVI framework for baseline comparison. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In 2010 the Gulf Coast experienced the largest oil spill affecting U.S. waters in history. Evaporating crude oil and dispersant chemicals can cause major health problems. This paper examines the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on air quality and infant health outcomes. Using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) AirData, vital statistics data from National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and a difference-in-difference methodology, we find that the oil spill of 2010 increased concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO in affected coastal counties, increased incidence of low birth weight (<2500 g) and premature born infants (<37 weeks of gestation). Heterogeneity effects reveal more pronounced adverse infant health outcomes for black, Hispanic, less educated, unmarried, and younger mothers. Results are robust to a wide range of controls and robustness checks. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the association between Hurricane Harvey landfall with maternal and neonatal morbidity.METHODS:Using an institutional perinatal database from two hospitals in Houston, Texas, women with nonanomalous singletons delivering after 24 weeks of gestation between August 2011 and June 2018 were included. To evaluate the possible association of hurricane landfall with pregnancy outcomes, gravid women delivering within 280 days (40 weeks of gestation) on or after August 25, 2017 (the day of hurricane landfall) were categorized as exposed, and women who delivered before August 25, 2017, were the reference group. Composite maternal morbidity included any of the following: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, chorioamnionitis, endometritis, blood transfusion, peripartum hysterectomy, maternal critical care admission, pulmonary edema, or maternal death. Composite neonatal morbidity included any of the following: 5-minute Apgar score 3 or less, respiratory distress syndrome, use of ventilator or continuous positive airway pressure, suspected newborn sepsis, seizure, stillbirth, or neonatal death. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated after correcting for possible confounders identified on univariate analysis. Disruption in outcome trends were measured in time series analyses.RESULTS:Of 40,502 deliveries in our database, 29,179 (72%) met the inclusion criteria, with 3,842 (13.2%) delivering within 280 days of Hurricane Harvey landfall. Women delivering after Hurricane Harvey were on average less likely to be obese and more likely to be older, Caucasian, married, have a household income higher than $75,000, a high school education, and private insurance. However, compared with the cohort of gravid patients who delivered before Hurricane Harvey, composite maternal morbidity increased by 27% (11.5% vs 14.7%, aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.14-1.42) after the storm. Composite neonatal morbidity increased by 50% (7.8% vs 11.9%, aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.34-1.71). In time series analyses, we observed a significant shift in composite maternal morbidity specific to women of low socioeconomic status (estimate 2.87, P=.028).CONCLUSION:Despite having fewer at-risk baseline characteristics, gravid patients delivering after landfall by Hurricane Harvey had a significantly higher likelihood of adverse outcomes as did their neonates. © 2019 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Introduction: The article is concerned with problems of morbidity of children and infant mortality during the latest 30th years after Chernobyl catastrophe. The 30th anniversary of the Chornobyl disaster is a stage that determines the analysis of its consequences, the assessment of the effects of radiation, the impact of the accident factors on the health of the population of the most affected countries and on global processes. The aim: To study the condition of child population of regions of Ukraine, which were contaminated by radionuclides in the result of Chernobyl catastrophe. Material and methods: Statistic assessment and epidemiological analysis were used to analyze materials of the investigations. Conclusions: Results of comparative analysis demonstrate the stabile increase of morbidity level as residents of regions of TRC. Abnormalities of respiratory system present the first group of the morbidity among children. The morbidity level of blood and blood forming diseases, tumors formation, diseases of endocrine system, digestive disorders, metabolism disorders significantly increases. The level of child population morbidity after Chernobyl catastrophe increases in 3.2 times. Respiratory diseases are involved in the first place in this structure.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Existing research has established a causal link between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and severe birth defects or consequent health impairments; however, more subtle cognitive impairments have not been explored. OBJECTIVE To determine whether infants of mothers with at least 1 positive ZIKV test show differences in cognitive scores at ages 3 to 6 months and ages 9 to 12 months. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study recruited infants enrolled in existing ZIKV study cohorts associated with the Maternal-Infant Studies Center and the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium at the University of Puerto Rico and from the broader San Juan metropolitan area. The study took place at the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium at the University of Puerto Rico. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling if their mothers underwent ZIKV testing prenatally and were at the target ages during the study period. Infants who were born preterm (<36 weeks’ gestational age), with low birth weight (<2500 g), or with a known genetic disorder were excluded. Infants were tested from ages 3 to 6 months or ages 9 to 12 months from May 2018 to April 2019. Data analysis was performed from March to April 2019. EXPOSURES Zika virus status was measured prenatally and in the early postnatal period using real-time polymerase chain reaction or a ZIKV IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The infants’ development was assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (translated to Spanish and adapted for Puerto Rico), and assessors were blinded to each infant’s ZIKV status. RESULTS A total of 65 study participants were included. The mean (SD) age of the infants at the time of cognitive testing was 8.98 (3.19) months. Most of the infants were white (55 [84.6%]) and Puerto Rican (64 [98.5%]); 38 of the infants were male (58.5%). General cognitive and domain-specific scores did not differ significantly between prenatally ZIKV-positive and ZIKV-negative infants except for receptive language score (mean difference = 5.52; t = 2.10; P = .04). Exposure to ZIKV (B = −5.69; β = −0.26 [95% CI −11.01 to −0.36]; P = .04) and a measure of Hurricane Maria exposure (time without water, B = −0.05; β = −0.27 [95% CI, −0.10 to −0.01]; P = .03) were both independently and significantly associated with receptive language scores after adjusting for key confounders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although infants exposed to ZIKV prenatally showed unaffected motor and visually mediated cognitive development, they did show deficits in receptive language scores. Receptive language skills were also associated with the degree of exposure to Hurricane Maria, with those who spent more time without water after the hurricane having lower receptive language scores. © 2019 Valdes V et al.

AB  - Colorado is regularly impacted by long-range transport of wildfire smoke from upwind regions. This smoke is a major source of ambient PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Maternal exposure to total PM<inf>2.5</inf> during pregnancy has been linked to decreased birth weight and other adverse outcomes, although the impact of wildfire smoke contribution has only recently been investigated. The objective of this study was to estimate associations between adverse pregnancy outcomes and ambient wildfire smoke PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Wildfire smoke PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposures were estimated using a previously published method incorporating ground-based monitors and remote sensing data. Logistic regression models stratified by ZIP code and mixed models with random intercept by ZIP code were used to test for associations. The primary outcomes of interest were preterm birth and birth weight. Secondary outcomes included gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, neonatal intensive care unit admission, assisted ventilation, small for gestational age, and low birth weight. Exposure to wildfire smoke PM<inf>2.5</inf> over the full gestation and during the second trimester were positively associated with pre-term birth (OR = 1.076 (µg/m3)−1 [95% CI = 1.016, 1.139; p = 0.013] and 1.132 (µg/m3)−1 [95% CI = 1.088, 1.178]; p < 0.0001, respectively), while exposure during the first trimester was associated with decreased birth weight (−5.7 g/(µg/m3) [95% CI: −11.1, −0.4; p = 0.036]). Secondary outcomes were mixed. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The Kumamoto earthquake that struck Japan in 2016 left 50 people dead and 2,804 injured, and led to the evacuation of 183,882. The Kumamoto earthquake actually involved two big earthquakes, the second being larger than the first, causing damage to many buildings and a fear of aftershocks, which led residents to want to stay at evacuation centers. Numerous medical assistance teams, such as disaster medical assistance teams (DMATs), came from all parts of Japan and were coordinated by local health authorities, including the health center in AsoCity. Humanitarian Medical Assistance (HuMA; Tokyo, Japan) is a medical, nongovernmental organization in Japan. The HuMA organization supported theAso Health Center in managing the large number of assistance teams and starting a health cluster meeting. © 2019 World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine.

AB  - Special populations, which include the morbidly obese and patients with chronic, complex medical conditions that require long-term health care services and infrastructure, are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality when these services are disrupted during a disaster. Past experiences have identified significant challenges in restoring necessary care services to these patients following major environmental events. This article describes the impact of disasters on special populations, provides a framework for future disaster preparation and planning, and identifies areas in need of further research.

AB  - Background: With their unique history of exposure to extensive nuclear testing between 1946 and 1958, descendants of Marshall Island residents may have underappreciated genetic abnormalities, increasing their risk of birth defects. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of resident women with at least one singleton live birth between 1997 and 2013 in northwest Arkansas using state birth certificate data linked to data from the Arkansas Reproductive Health Monitoring System, a statewide birth defects registry. We calculated unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from modified Poisson regression analyses for non-Hispanic (NH) whites, NH-blacks, Hispanics and Marshallese, using NH-whites as the reference group. Results: Of the 91,662 singleton births during the study period, 2,488 were to Marshallese women. Due to the relatively small number of Marshallese births, we could not calculate prevalence estimates for some defects. Marshallese infants had higher rates of congenital cataracts (PR = 9.3; 95% CI: 3.1, 27.9). Although the number of defects was low, Marshallese infants also had higher rates of truncus arteriosus (PR = 44.0; 95% CI: 2.2, 896.1). Conclusions: Marshallese infants may have increased risk of specific birth defects, but estimates are unstable because of small sample size so results are inconclusive. Larger population-based studies would allow for further investigation of this potential risk among Marshallese infants. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective. This study investigates the trend of perinatal mortality rates in Fukushima Prefecture and four neighboring prefectures (Miyagi, Gunma, Tochigi, and Ibaraki) after the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011. Material and methods. Japanese monthly perinatal mortality data on a prefecture level are available on a website of the Japanese government. A combined regression of perinatal mortality rates from the study region and the rest of Japan (the control region) is conducted. The regression model allows for an asymptotic lower limit and a level change of perinatal mortality rates in 2012-2017 in the study region relative to the predicted trend. Results. In 2012-2017, perinatal mortality in the study region shows a significant 10.6% increase relative to the trend in preceding years (p = 0.006). The excess mortality translates to 195 (95% CI: 28, 462) excess perinatal deaths. The increase is three times greater in Fukushima Prefecture than in the four neighboring prefectures and the difference in excess rates is statistically significant (p = 0.010). Periodic peaks of perinatal mortality are found in 2012-2017 with maxima around April. Conclusion. We find an increase in perinatal mortality in Fukushima and four neighboring prefectures after the Fukushima nuclear accident. The results agree with similar observations in Germany and Ukraine after the Chernobyl disaster. Due to its ecological design, the study cannot prove a causal link between radiation exposure and perinatal mortality. Continued observation of the trend of perinatal mortality in contaminated regions of Japan is recommended. © 2019 Society for Radiological Protection.

AB  - Adoption of virtual reality technology may be delayed due to high up-front costs with unknown returns on that investment. In this article, we present a cost analysis of using virtual reality as a training tool. Virtual reality was used to train neonatal intensive care workers in hospital evacuation. A live disaster exercise with mannequins was also conducted that approximated the virtual experience. Comparative costs are presented for the planning, development, and implementation of both interventions. Initially, virtual reality is more expensive, with a cost of $229.79 per participant (total cost $18 617.54 per exercise) for the live drill versus $327.78 (total cost $106 951.14) for virtual reality. When development costs are extrapolated to repeated training over 3 years, however, the virtual exercise becomes less expensive with a cost of $115.43 per participant, while the cost of live exercises remains fixed. The larger initial investment in virtual reality can be spread across a large number of trainees and a longer time period with little additional cost, while each live drill requires additional costs that scale with the number of participants. © 2019 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - We set out to examine the relations between prenatal exposure to the natural disaster Superstorm Sandy, maternal depression, and offspring electrodermal activity (EDA). EDA was measured via skin conductance response (SCR) magnitude in 198 children (M = 42.54 months, SD = 12.76) during a startle paradigm. In keeping with prior research, we expected prenatal depression to be associated with hyporeactive EDA and prenatal stress to be associated with hyperreactive EDA. SCR magnitude was lower in children prenatally exposed to depression alone, when compared to Superstorm Sandy, and controls. SCR magnitude of children prenatally exposed to both maternal depression and the storm was lower than that of all other groups. Our results emphasize the influence of maternal prenatal mental health, support targeted risk assessment for children who experienced an adverse prenatal environment, and highlight the need for a deeper understanding of the interactions between maternal mood and stress on the developing child. © 2019

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of Tornado and Hilal (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) hysteroscopic proximal tubal occlusion (HPTO) for hydrosalpinx (HX) treatment before in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET) in patients with dense pelvic adhesions or low ovarian reserve. Design: A retrospective study of patients treated between May 2014 and May 2016 (Canadian Task Force classification III). Setting: A university-affiliated center. Patients: One hundred fifty women with unilateral or bilateral HX who were not candidates for laparoscopic surgery. Intervention: Tornado or Hilal HPTO before IVF-ET and/or frozen ET. Measurements and Main Results: The main outcome was the cumulative live birth rate. Tornado or Hilal placement was successful for 143 (95.3%) patients. Of the 132 patients who underwent 204 ET cycles, 86 (65.2%) conceived, and 78 (59.1%) resulted in live births. The overall early and late miscarriage rates per clinical pregnancy were 12.8% and 1.1%, respectively. The ectopic pregnancy rate was 2.3%. No major complications occurred. Conclusion: Tornado or Hilal HPTO is an effective alternative for treating HX before IVF-ET/frozen ET in patients with dense pelvic adhesions or low ovarian reserve. © 2018 AAGL

AB  - Background: The frequency and intensity of hurricane have increased greatly. However, whether hurricane exposure is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications is less known. Objective: To assess the immediate impact and lasting impact of Hurricane Sandy (Sandy)on pregnancy complications. Methods: Using time-series study, we estimated the relative risks (RRs)of emergency department (ED)visits for pregnancy complications in eight affected counties in New York State, based on data of 2005–2014. The immediate impact was estimated by comparing the ED visits of pregnancy complications during the Sandy period to the non-Sandy periods. For the lasting impact of Sandy, we estimated the RRs by contrasting the ED visits in the following 12 months after Sandy with the same months of other years. Results: We found that ED visits for overall pregnancy complications increased 6.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.2%, 10.5%)during the Sandy month. ED visits increased for threatened abortion (9.9%, 95% CI: 4.4%, 15.7%), threatened labor (10.1%, 95% CI: 1.9%, 18.9%), early onset of delivery (115.9%, 95% CI: 6.9%, 336.3%), renal disease (73.2%, 95% CI: 0.3%, 199.4%), and diabetes (42.3%, 95% CI: 15.0%, 76.0%). Gestational hypertension and renal disease were elevated 7–8 months after Sandy. The ED visits of mental illness increased gradually after Sandy and peaked eight months later with visits increasing 33.2%. Conclusions: This study suggests that hurricanes may impact pregnancy health immediately and that some negative health may last for months thereafter. © 2019

AB  - Background: The reductions achieved in infant mortality in Japan are globally regarded as remarkable. However, no studies in Japan have classified infant mortality trends into neonatal and postneonatal or considered regional issues. This study aimed to explore trends in neonatal and postneonatal deaths, both overall for Japan and in a region affected by a natural disaster. Methods: Drawing on national infant death data, we used a multi-attribute compositional study design to examine all infant deaths occurring in a region affected by a disaster (Tohoku, which consists of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima) between 2002 and 2012. We used conjoint analysis to clarify the associations between infant and maternal characteristics and age of infant death. Results: We obtained data of a total of 31,012 infant deaths between 2002 and 2012, which included 1450 from Tohoku. Infant mortality rates in Japan overall declined over the period but increased in 2011. There were more postneonatal (29-364 days post-birth) than neonatal (0-28 days post-birth) deaths. Infant deaths in Tohoku declined slightly overall, with a fluctuation in 2011. In Tohoku, the trends in postneonatal death rates were similar; the overall rates for males increased, but those for females decreased in 2011. We found that the cause and place of infant death differed by gender for neonatal and postneonatal deaths in both Japan in general and Tohoku. The conjoint analysis showed that most variables affected the age of postneonatal death. The factor with the largest influence on the variation in infant death age was gestational week (55.5%). A maternal gestational week ≤36 was linked to an average age at death of 43.4 days, and > 37 was linked to an average of 83.7 days. Conclusions: In Japan, infant death rates have declined steadily over the past 10 years. The recent trends indicated that postneonatal death rates were higher than neonatal rates, especially in Tohoku. However, not much attention has been focused on postneonatal deaths in Japan. Our findings may help health planners to prioritise work on the factors that are linked to infant deaths in the neonatal and postneonatal periods.

AB  - Recent public health emergencies have highlighted the unique vulnerabilities of pregnant women and infants to emerging health threats and the critical role of public health surveillance. Surveillance systems can collect critical data to measure the impact of a disease or disaster and can be used to inform clinical guidance and prevention strategies. These systems can also be tailored to collect data on vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women and their infants. Novel surveillance systems to assess risks and outcomes of pregnant women and infants have been established during public health emergencies but typically cease data collection once the public health response has ended, limiting our ability to collect data to understand longer-term outcomes. State-based birth defects surveillance systems are not available in all states, and no national surveillance system linking pregnancy exposure data to longitudinal outcomes for infants and children exists. In this report, we describe ongoing surveillance efforts to monitor congenital syphilis, Zika virus infection during pregnancy, and neonatal abstinence syndrome. We describe the need and rationale for an ongoing integrated surveillance system to monitor pregnant women and their infants and to detect emerging threats.

AB  - AbstractIntroduction: Unexpected disasters, such as earthquakes or fires, require preparation to address knowledge gaps that may negatively affect vulnerable patients. Training programs can promote natural disaster readiness to respond and evacuate patients safely, but also require evidence-based information to guide learning objectives.Problem: There is limited evidence on what skills and bedside equipment are most important to include in disaster training and evacuation programs for critically ill infants.Methods: An expert panel was used to create a 13-item mastery checklist of skills for bedside registered nurses (RNs) required to successfully evacuate a critically ill infant. Expert nurses were surveyed, and the Angoff method was used to determine which of the mastery checklist skills a newly graduated nurse (ie, the minimally competent nurse) should be able to do. Participants then rated the importance of 26 commonly available pieces of bedside equipment for use in evacuating a hemodynamically unstable, intubated infant during a disaster.Results: Twenty-three emergency department (ED) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) charge RNs responded to the survey with a mean of 19 (SD = 9) years of experience and 30% reporting personal experience with evacuating patients. The skills list scores showed an emphasis on the newly graduated nurse having more complete mastery of skills surrounding thermoregulation, documentation, infection control, respiratory support, and monitoring. Skills for communication, decision making, and anticipating future needs were assessed as less likely for a new nurse to have mastered. On a scale of one (not important) to seven (critically important), the perceived necessity of equipment ranged from a low of 1.6 (breast pump) to a high of 6.9 (face mask). The individual intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.55 showed moderate reliability between raters and the average team ICC of 0.97 showed excellent agreement as a group.Conclusion: Experts rated the ability to manage physiological issues, such as thermoregulation and respiratory support, as skills that every nurse should master. Disaster preparedness activities for nurses in training may benefit from checklists of essential equipment and skills to ensure all nurses can independently manage patients' physiologic needs when they enter the workforce. Advanced nursing training should include education on decision making, communication during emergencies, and anticipation of future issues to ensure that charge and resource nurses can support bedside nurses during evacuation events. © 2019 World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine.

AB  - In August 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck the Baltimore/Washington, District of Columbia, corridor. The event identified a critical requirement to prepare our interprofessional team to evacuate approximately 60 neonatal patients. A needs assessment indicated that 60% of staff members had little or no knowledge of the unit's evacuation plan and 55% of respondents were not aware of their specific role in an emergency evacuation. The neonatal intensive care unit educators in collaboration with the unit's medical team, the leadership team, the hospital emergency management team, and the unit practice and professional council coordinated the design, implementation, and assessment of the simulated evacuation activity. To encourage realism within the simulated activity, prepared manikins were placed in patient rooms and assigned varying levels of acuity. The training session began with a prebrief session that included a description of the evacuation plan, delineation of roles, responsibilities based on scope of practice, use of the evacuation equipment, and unit emergency bags. Participants engaged in a debrief session following each session during which the staff notably expressed an increased confidence with the evacuation plan, roles, and operation of the evacuation equipment. In addition, the debriefing allowed for identification of latent threats, which the planning group used to streamline the evacuation process. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Following the Thalidomide disaster, the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN) was established in 1967, with epidemiological surveillance of congenital anomalies as one main aim. Limb reduction defects (LRD) constitute a rare and heterogeneous anomaly group, where correct registration and classification is important for surveillance and research. We aimed at reviewing and recoding LRD cases in the MBRN using the same classification system for all years, and evaluate time trends, characteristics and risk factors, 1970–2016. Methods After reviewing and recoding LRD cases using International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 10th version, for all years, time trends, association with major anomalies, risk factors and infant outcomes were calculated. Generalized linear models for the binomial family with log link gave relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Classification of LRD as suggested by European surveillance of congenital anomalies (EUROCAT) was attempted. Results Overall LRD prevalence, 1970–2016, was 4.4 per 10 000, slightly increasing during 1970–1981, followed by relatively stable rates. There were more defects in upper than lower limbs. Defects in hands/fingers were most common, but unspecific descriptions prevented classification of LRD according to EUROCAT. A majority of cases had associated anomalies, the most common being other limb defects, followed by cardiac defects and anomalies in the nervous and digestive systems. From 1999, 26% of LRD cases were terminated, more than 90% of these had associated major anomalies. Stillbirth, neonatal and infant mortality were higher among infants with LRD, also related to associated anomalies. Pre-gestational diabetes was associated with a more than three times increased risk of offspring total LRD, while no association with maternal epilepsy was found. Taking folate/multivitamin supplements before and/or during pregnancy was associated with lower risk of offspring LRD (adjusted RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6–0.9), while daily smoking did not significantly increase the risk. Conclusion The MBRN now has information on LRD coded by ICD-10 from 1970, but information is not specific enough to use other recommended classification systems. Collecting radiographic descriptions and/or more details from hospital records would improve the quality of the registry data. Taking folate supplements before/during pregnancy may reduce the risk of offspring LRD. © 2019 Klungsøyr et al.

AB  - Backgrounds: The effect of breastfeeding on weight status of individuals after a large-scale natural disaster in a developed country is unclear. We aimed to investigate the association of breastfeeding with childhood overweight and/or obesity in areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake. Materials and Methods: From health examination records of 15,563 children, we retrospectively obtained anthropometric and feeding practice (formula, mixed, and breastfeeding) data during early childhood. According to their age at the time of the earthquake, we subdivided the children into study groups 1 (42-48 months), 2 (18-24 months), and 3 (<3 months). Overweight, obesity, and underweight were defined on the basis of body mass index. To assess the association between feeding practice at 3 months of age and the risk of overweight and/or obesity at 3 years of age, we developed generalized linear mixed models that included a random effect of the municipality of residence; for this analysis, we combined "mixed feeding" and "formula feeding" into a single category: "mixed plus formula feeding." Results: Mixed- plus formula-fed children had a significantly higher risk of overweight and/or obesity than breastfed children in all three study groups (odds ratios, 1.20-2.22; all p ≤ 0.047). The rate of underweight at 3 years of age was ≤0.3%, irrespective of feeding practices. Conclusion: Breastfeeding, even during a large-scale natural disaster in a developed country, maintained its protective effect against overweight and/or obesity in childhood. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.

AB  - Parenting preterm infants is a unique experience distinct from parenting full-term infants, characterized by a delayed transition to parenthood and limited caregiving opportunities. This study explored mothers’ and fathers’ lived experiences of parenting during infancy in the context of preterm birth. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 parents (6 fathers, 7 mothers) of preterm infants. Data were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Four superordinate themes emerged: (a) An unnatural disaster: The traumatic nature of preterm birth, (b) The immediate aftermath: Disconnected and displaced, (c) Breaking the ice: Moving from frozen to melted, and (d) Aftershocks: Transitioning home. Both parents experienced preterm birth as traumatic. Similarities and differences in mothers’ and fathers’ experiences were identified. Preterm birth posed challenges for nurturant and social caregiving and resulted in anxiety, hypervigilance, and overprotective parenting behavior. The results highlight the need for trauma-informed care and further research developing and testing empirically based interventions. © 2019 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health

AB  - Background: The global burden of pediatric surgical conditions continues to remain inadequately addressed, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Among the many factors contributing to this gap are a lack of access to care secondary to resource shortages and inequitable distribution, underfinancing of healthcare systems, poor quality of care, and contextual challenges such as natural disasters and conflict. The relative contribution of these and other factors varies widely by region and even with countries of a region. Methods: This review seeks to discuss the heterogeneity of global pediatric surgery and offer recommendations for addressing the barriers to high-quality pediatric surgical care throughout the world. Results: There is significant heterogeneity in pediatric surgical challenges, both between regions and among countries in the same region, although data are limited. This heterogeneity can reflect differences in demographics, epidemiology, geography, income level, health spending, historical health policies, and cultural practices, among others. Conclusion: Country-level research and stakeholder engagement are needed to better understand the heterogeneity of local needs and drive policy changes that contribute to sustainable reforms. Key to these efforts will be improved financing, access to and quality of pediatric surgical care. © 2018, Société Internationale de Chirurgie.

AB  - Preterm birth is a major public health problem, especially in Puerto Rico where the rates are among the highest observed worldwide, reaching 18% in 2011. The Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) study is an ongoing investigation of environmental factors that contribute to this condition. In the present analysis, we sought to examine common risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse birth outcomes which have not been characterized previously in this unique population. Pregnant women from the PROTECT cohort are recruited from the heavily contaminated Northern coast of the island of Puerto Rico and are free of pre-existing conditions like diabetes. We examined associations between basic demographic, behavioral (e.g., tobacco and alcohol use), and pregnancy (e.g., season and year of delivery) characteristics as well as municipality of residence in relation to preterm birth (37 weeks gestation), postterm birth (≥41 weeks gestation), and small and large for gestational age in univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Between 2011 and 2017, 1028 live singleton births were delivered as part of the PROTECT cohort. Of these, 107 (10%) were preterm. Preterm birth rates were higher among women with low socioeconomic status, as indicated by education level and income, and among women with high pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Odds ratios of small for gestational age delivery were higher for women who reported tobacco use in pregnancy and lower for women who delivered in the hurricane and dengue season (July-October). Overall, in pregnant women residing in Puerto Rico, socioeconomic status was associated with preterm birth but few other factors were associated with this or other adverse outcomes of pregnancy. Research to understand environmental factors that could be contributing to the preterm birth epidemic in Puerto Rico is necessary. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

AB  - The Pregnancy and Birth Survey of the Fukushima Health Management Survey is a questionnaire survey that has been conducted annually since 2011 in Fukushima Prefecture. Since 2016, the survey has been available online as well as in paper form. This study aimed to determine whether making the survey available online improved response rates and to identify the characteristics of paper and online survey respondents and their results. Using LimeSurvey, we constructed an online survey environment that enabled responses via computer or mobile device. Respondents could choose whether to respond on paper or online. The response rate for the 2016 survey was 51.8%, an increase of 3.5% over the previous year. Of these responses, 15.8% were made online. Online respondents were mostly primiparous. Further, while there was no difference in the percentage of respondents who provided free responses, the amount written was higher in paper surveys than in online surveys. The combination of paper and online surveys increased convenience for respondents and contributed to improved response rates. In addition, paper surveys were superior in terms of allowing respondents to express their feelings and opinions. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Severity of clinical expression and high mortality could not facilitate establishing exposure index/association following MIC disaster in Bhopal. Mortality-based exposure stratification was critiqued by the International Medical Commission on Bhopal (IMCB). IMCB stratified exposure considering distance as surrogate at 2 km intervals after 10 years. The first follow-up cytogenetic screening of the pre-screened survivors after 30 years has demonstrated chromosome abnormalities (CA). Exposure stratification was attempted considering cytogenetic screening conducted during 1986–1988. Elevation of CA appeared proportional to exposure status and authenticated the initial mortality-based stratification. The one-on-one comparison of the previous and present cytogenetics has described the individual response to MIC exposure over 30 years. Chi-square test has been carried out for checking the cytogenetic changes at the individual level statistically, which revealed that differences of chromosomal aberrations collected immediately post-disaster and 30 years later are nonsignificant. The prominence of interindividual variation was noticed in general. The impact of overall exposure was higher in males. Constitutional abnormalities in 8.5% of the study population, including translocation, inversion, deletion, fragile sites, etc., necessitate screening of blood-linked members. The incidence of acrocentric association was prominent in the study population. Normal karyotype in children born to severely exposed parents with congenital anomalies indicates necessity of molecular karyotyping and/or screening of mutations. The study highlights follow-up of the health of the index cases at shorter (3–6 months) intervals. This comprehensive spectrum of cytogenetic report highlights immediate post-disaster chromosomal aberrations, the changes that occurred over 30 years in conjunction with other environmental factors at the individual level, constitutive genomic aberrations, polymorphic variations, and chromosomal patterns in congenitally malformed children of the survivors, which collectively indicate the possibility of acquisition/persistence of stable aberrations in MIC-exposed lymphocytes through interaction with environmental/biological confounders. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We aimed to compare the pregnancy status of the pregnant women and birth status of their newborns, socioeconomic status, and access to health services, between high- and low-damage areas in Heris, affected by the Varzaghan Earthquake, 2012.Methods The study was conducted on pregnant women at any trimester of pregnancy (with complete medical profiles in local health centers) in August 2012 (time of the earthquake) who lived in Heris and delivered up to March 2013. Data were obtained on pregnancy- and infant-related variables, housing, socioeconomic status, and access to health services, including food supplies, before and after the earthquake.Results Family income and mothers' education were lower in highly damaged areas. Among these women, underweight at first trimester of pregnancy was higher, and weight gain during the last trimester was lower, compared with low-damage regions. Preterm delivery was higher in low-damage areas. Birth indices of the infants were not significantly different between the 2 areas; however, in highly damaged areas, moderate malnutrition was more prevalent among children under 1 year (weight-for-age) and under 2 years (height-for-age).Conclusions Socioeconomic status of mothers was lower in highly damaged areas and might have played a role in their own and newborns' health status. © 2018 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the detection of spatial clusters based on linkage information of a map dataset. Spatial scan statistic has been widely used for detecting a hotspot cluster (or a coldspot cluster) in various fields, such as astronomy, biosurveillance, natural disasters, and forestry. This approach is based on the idea of finding a connected regional subset that maximizes likelihood in the whole study area. To detect a hotspot cluster, which aggregates high-risk regions so as to be maximum likelihood, we only just search such a cluster from all patterns of connected regional subsets. However, except when there are extremely few regions of the study area, since the total number of connected regional patterns usually becomes enormous, we cannot investigate all of them. This means that we have not been able to know whether a detected hotspot which is obtained under certain rules, such as using the previous studies, has the truly maximum likelihood within a given study area. A zero-suppressed binary decision diagram (ZDD), one approach to frequent item set mining, enables us to extract all of the potential cluster regions at a realistic computational load. In this study, we propose a hotspot detection method using ZDD-based enumeration, and apply it to sudden infant death syndrome in North Carolina. This completely new method enables us to detect a true hotspot cluster that has the truly maximum likelihood. To evaluate our proposed method, we compare the properties of that with existing methods such as flexible scan and echelon scan, and discuss their suitability for different purposes of detecting hotspot. © 2019, Japanese Federation of Statistical Science Associations.

AB  - Background: The Icelandic volcano Laki erupted from June 1783 through January 1784. It produced 122 megatons of sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and acid rain and contributed to one of the coldest winters on record in Western Europe. Although uncontrollable volcanic eruptions continue, few studies have investigated their perinatal health implications. Methods: Using the Human Mortality Database, we assessed the association between the Laki event and the secondary sex ratio, infant mortality rates, and the number of births from 1751 to 1800 with time-series models that controlled for temporal trends. Results: The secondary sex ratio decreased 3% below expected levels in 1784 (95% CI =-4%,-1%). Both female and male infant mortality rates exceeded expectation in 1785, by 54% (95% CI = 25%, 83%) and 37% (-1%, 74%), respectively. We observed little change in female live births but a reduction in male live births in 1784. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the large-scale Laki volcanic eruptions of 1783-1784 resulted in adverse perinatal health outcomes in Sweden. © © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Objective: This study examined differences in learning outcomes among newborn intensive care unit (NICU) workers who underwent virtual reality simulation (VRS) emergency evacuation training versus those who received web-based clinical updates (CU). Learning outcomes included a) knowledge gained, b) confidence with evacuation, and c) performance in a live evacuation exercise. Methods: A longitudinal, mixed-method, quasi-experimental design was implemented utilizing a sample of NICU workers randomly assigned to VRS training or CUs. Four VRS scenarios were created that augmented neonate evacuation training materials. Learning was measured using cognitive assessments, self-efficacy questionnaire (baseline, 0, 4, 8, 12 months), and performance in a live drill (baseline, 12 months). Data were collected following training and analyzed using mixed model analysis. Focus groups captured VRS participant experiences. Results: The VRS and CU groups did not statistically differ based upon the scores on the Cognitive Assessment or perceived self-efficacy. The virtual reality group performance in the live exercise was statistically (P<.0001) and clinically (effect size of 1.71) better than that of the CU group. Conclusions: Training using VRS is effective in promoting positive performance outcomes and should be included as a method for disaster training. VRS can allow an organization to train, test, and identify gaps in current emergency operation plans. In the unique case of disasters, which are low-volume and high-risk events, the participant can have access to an environment without endangering themselves or clients. © Copyright 2018 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.

AB  - Objective: Despite emerging evidence of the detrimental effects of natural disasters on maternal and child health, little is known about exposure to tornadoes during the prenatal period and its impact on birth outcomes. We examined the relationship between prenatal exposure to the spring 2011 tornado outbreak in Alabama and Joplin (Missouri) and adverse birth outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional cohort study using the 2010-2012 linked infant births and deaths data set from the National Center for Health Statistics for tornado-affected counties in Alabama (n=126,453) and Missouri (Joplin, n=6,897). Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate associations between prenatal exposure to tornadoes and birth outcomes. Results: Prenatal exposure to the tornado incidents did not influence birth weight outcomes. Women exposed to Alabama tornadoes were less likely to have a preterm birth compared to unexposed mothers (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.91, 0.96). Preterm births among Joplin-tornado exposed mothers were slightly higher (13%) compared with unexposed mothers (11.2%). Exposed mothers from Joplin were also more likely to have a cesarean section compared to their counterparts (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.26). Conclusions: We found no association between tornado exposure and adverse birth weight and infant mortality rates. Our findings suggest that prenatal exposure can amplify the odds for a cesarean section. © Copyright 2018 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.

AB  - Following ethnic, economic, and religious tensions, the republic of Biafra unilaterally declared independence from the rest of Nigeria in 1967. This action triggered the Nigerian civil war in which the inflow of food and supplies to Biafra was blocked. The result was extensive famine, regarded as one of the great nutritional disasters of modern times. During the two-and-a-half years of armed conflict, an estimated one to three million people died, most of them from starvation. Forty years later, adults in Enugu (the former capital of Biafra) who had been conceived or born during the famine and who survived the famine show health problems with two-to-three times higher prevalence of hypertension, glucose intolerance, and overweight than those born before or after the war. These findings support that undernutrition early in life have significant and adverse impact on human development and physiological design, eventually contributing to an increased risk for noncommunicable diseases in adulthood such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. The long-term effects of undernutrition during pregnancy and in infancy should be considered and receive high priority when setting goals for global health, education, and economic agendas. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - We examine the long-term impacts of drought exposure on women born in 19 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, across four decades. We find that women who were exposed to drought conditions during their early childhood are significantly less wealthy as adults. These effects are confined to women born and raised in rural households, indicating that the impacts of rainfall are felt via changes in agricultural output. In addition to lower levels of wealth, women who experience droughts in infancy also receive fewer years of formal education and, in the case of extreme drought conditions, have reduced adult heights. Our results also suggest that drought exposure in infancy can have long-term, negative impacts on women's empowerment. Finally, we also show that these impacts may be transmitted to the women's offspring, with children of affected women more likely to be born at a low birth weight (weighing <2.5 kg). To our knowledge, this represents the largest study to date both geographically and over time showing a strong relationship between early life rainfall conditions and adult outcomes, and the first to show that the impacts could span generations. © 2018

AB  - This study recruited a prospective cohort of 380 pregnant women before, during, or after Superstorm Sandy in 2012 to examine the association between disaster-related pre- and post-natal maternal stress and offspring temperament at 6 months-old. Mothers prospectively reported stressful experiences during the storm and rated their child’s temperament 6 months postpartum. Results indicated that length of time without phone or electricity and financial loss was associated with offspring negative affect, whereas financial loss and threat of death or injury was associated with emotion dysregulation. Furthermore, offspring born before the storm had greater negative affect and lower emotion regulation than those born after the storm. Given the probable increase in the occurrence of natural disasters due to climate change in recent years (McCarthy, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate change 2001: impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability: contribution of Working Group II to the third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2001), our results highlight the necessity of education and planning to help ameliorate any potential consequences on the developing infant. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives To identify and measure the place-specific determinants that are associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in the southern region of Mozambique. Design Retrospective cohort study. Choice of variables informed by literature and Delphi consensus. Setting Study conducted during the baseline phase of a community level intervention for pre-eclampsia that was led by community health workers. Participants A household census identified 50 493 households that were home to 80 483 women of reproductive age (age 12-49 years). Of these women, 14 617 had been pregnant in the 12 months prior to the census, of which 9172 (61.6%) had completed their pregnancies. Primary and secondary outcome measures A combined fetal, maternal and neonatal outcome was calculated for all women with completed pregnancies. Results A total of six variables were statistically significant (p≤0.05) in explaining the combined outcome. These included: Geographic isolation, flood proneness, access to an improved latrine, average age of reproductive age woman, family support and fertility rates. The performance of the ordinary least squares model was an adjusted R 2 =0.69. Three of the variables (isolation, latrine score and family support) showed significant geographic variability in their effect on rates of adverse outcome. Accounting for this modest non-stationary effect through geographically weighted regression increased the adjusted R 2 to 0.71. Conclusions The community exploration was successful in identifying context-specific determinants of maternal health. The results highlight the need for designing targeted interventions that address the place-specific social determinants of maternal health in the study area. The geographic process of identifying and measuring these determinants, therefore, has implications for multisectoral collaboration. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - Despite the importance of health vulnerability in disaster risk assessment, most of the existing disaster vulnerability indicators only emphasize economic and social vulnerability. Important underlying health risks such as non-communicable disease are not included in vulnerability measures. A three-phase methodology approach was used to construct a disaster risk model that includes a number of key health indicators which might be missing in global disaster risk analysis. This study describes the development of an integrated health vulnerability index and explains how the proposed vulnerability index may be incorporated into an all-hazard based disaster risk index in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), also known as the “Silk Road Economic Belt”, region. Relevant indicators were identified and reviewed in the published literature in PubMed/Medline. A two-stage dimension reduction statistical method was used to determine the weightings of relevant dimensions to the construction of the overall vulnerability index. The proposed final health vulnerability index included nine indicators, including the proportion of the population below 15 and above 65 years, under-five mortality ratio, maternal mortality ratio, tuberculosis prevalence, age-standardized raised blood pressure, physician ratio, hospital bed ratio, and coverage of the measles-containing-vaccine first-dose (MCV1) and diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) vaccines. This proposed index, which has a better reflection of the health vulnerability in communities, may serve as a policy and implementation tool to facilitate the capacity-building of Health-Emergency Disaster Risk management (Health-EDRM). © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The preconception, pregnancy and immediate postpartum and newborn periods are times for mothers and their offspring when they are especially vulnerable to major stressors - those that are sudden and unexpected and those that are chronic. Their adverse effects can transcend generations. Stressors can include natural disasters or political stressors such as conflict and/or migration. Considerable evidence has accumulated demonstrating the adverse effects of natural disasters on pregnancy outcomes and developmental trajectories. However, beyond tracking outcomes, the time has arrived for gathering more information related to identifying mechanisms, predicting risk and developing stress-reducing and resilience-building interventions to improve outcomes. Further, we need to learn how to encapsulate both the quantitative and qualitative information available and share it with communities and authorities to mitigate the adverse developmental effects of future disasters, conflicts and migrations. This article briefly reviews prenatal maternal stress and identifies three contemporary situations (wildfire in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada; hurricane Harvey in Houston, USA and transgenerational and migrant stress in Pforzheim, Germany) where current studies are being established by Canadian investigators to test an intervention. The experiences from these efforts are related along with attempts to involve communities in the studies and share the new knowledge to plan for future disasters or tragedies. © Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease 2019.

AB  - Background: On 22 February 2011 an earthquake (magnitude 6.3) hit Christchurch, New Zealand. Earthquakes have been associated with increased risks of preterm birth (PTB) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, the literature on this subject is scarce. Maternal antenatal stress has been suggested as the link between earthquakes and PTB. In this study the Christchurch earthquake was utilised as a model of maternal stress to assess its effects on PTB rates and other pregnancy outcomes. Aim: To investigate whether women who experienced a major earthquake during the first trimester of pregnancy were at an altered risk of PTB compared to women who did not experience an earthquake during their pregnancy. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. Women carrying a singleton pregnancy in their first trimester on 22 February, 2011 were identified for a post-earthquake cohort (n = 1057). A group of women pregnant in 2009 were identified for a pre-earthquake cohort (n = 1314). Data were obtained from electronic medical records and the hospital clinical coding database. Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to analyse differences in pregnancy outcomes. Statistically significant variables together with earthquake exposure were assessed as risk factors for PTB using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: No significant difference in the rate of PTB was found between the two groups P > 0.05). Conclusion: Women carrying a singleton pregnancy in this study who experienced a major earthquake in their first trimester do not seem to be at an increased risk of PTB. © 2018 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists

AB  - Background: Antenatal common mental disorders (CMDs) including anxiety, depressive, adjustment, and somatoform disorders are prevalent worldwide. There is emerging evidence that experiencing a natural disaster might increase the risk of antenatal CMDs. This study aimed to synthesise the evidence about the prevalence and determinants of clinically-significant symptoms of antenatal CMDs among women who had recently experienced an earthquake. Methods: This systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The search included both electronic and manual components. Five major databases were searched. A data extraction table was used to summarise study characteristics and findings. Two authors examined the quality of studies independently using a quality assessment tool. A narrative synthesis of the findings reported. Results: In total seven articles met inclusion criteria. Quality scores ranged from six to seven out of ten. All the studies were cross-sectional surveys and were conducted in high and middle-income countries. Sample sizes varied among studies. The prevalence of clinically-significant symptoms of antenatal CMD ranged from 4.6% (95% CI, 3.2; 6.5) experiencing 'psychological stress' in Japan to 40.8% (95% CI, 35.5; 46.4) 'depression' in China. While all studies were conducted in an earthquake context, only four examined some aspect of earthquake experiences as a risk factor for antenatal CMDs. In multivariable analyses, higher marital conflict, poor social support, multiparity, stresses of pregnancy and the personality characteristic of a negative coping style were identified as risks and a positive coping style as protective against antenatal CMDs. Conclusions: This systematic review found that women who have recently experienced an earthquake are at heightened risk of antenatal mental health problems. It indicates that in addition to the establishment of services for safe birth which is recognised in post-disaster management strategies, pregnancy mental health should be a priority. The review also revealed that there is no evidence available from the world's low-income nations where natural disasters might have more profound impacts because local infrastructure is more fragile and where it is already established that women experience a higher burden of antenatal CMDs.

AB  - South Africa is a young democracy currently going through a crisis of leadership. The worst drought in recorded history has played out at regional level but against the backdrop of complex political dynamics. The government has lost significant capacity at the technical level, largely the result of political priorities driven by the need to decolonise society and the institutions of higher learning. This has manifest in the water sector as systemic failures of key instrumentation systems, rendering the El Niño event invisible until it hit. This case study of the El Niño event shows that drought management is embedded within a broader political process and is not simply a technical management issue. The Vaal River system sustains 60% of the national economy and 45% of the total population of the country, but water security in this system has been placed at risk because of political dynamics. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The article explores rare specimens of demographic statistics extracted from the seventeenth century works in Pashto and Persian which were composed in the Pashtun tribal territories. The study’s major source is the collection of historical accounts and genealogical records written by the Khaṫak tribal rulers Khushḥāl Khān (d. 1689) and his grandson Afżal Khān (d. circa 1740/41). These writings have survived in “The Khaṫaks’ Chronicle” — the archive of the Khaṫak chieftains included by Afżal Khān as a supplement into his historiographical compilation “The Ornamented History” (Tārīkh-i muraṣṣaʿ). Other sources are the poetical works of Khushḥāl Khān and the book in Persian by the theologian Akhūnd Darweza (d. 1618/19 or 1638/39) “An Account of Pious and Wicked” (Taẕkirat al-abrār wa-l-ashrār) which contains a report on the census conducted in the Yūsufzay tribe in the second quarter of the sixteenth century. The researched material includes data on the number of people in particular tribal units, birth dynamics, infant mortality and external negative factors, such as epidemics and natural disasters, that continuously affected demographic situation. The extant sources also shed light on family and matrimonial relations among Pashtuns in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The facts examined in the article indicate that Pashtun tribal rulers were well familiar with the basics of practical demography which they needed to monitor the number of tribesmen while accomplishing specific administrative, military and economic tasks. The demographic notes left by the Khaṫak chieftains are to be considered among the most unique documents on the history and the culture of Pashtun tribes in early modern times. © Санкт-Петербургский государственный университет, 2019

AB  - Two Reuters reporters were arrested in December 2017 by the military and subsequently charged with breaking the colonial-era Official Secrets Act (OSA) for obtaining documents about the execution of ten Rohingya boys and men in Myanmar’s western Rakhine state. Despite being pardoned in May 2019, the judicial travesty of their conviction and more than 500 days in jail had a major impact on international perceptions about press freedom in Myanmar, a nation widely denounced around the world for the military’s expulsion of some 730, 000 Muslim Rohingya in 2017-2018. Their saga illuminates the nexus of ethno-religious nationalism and continued military repression in a nation that seemed on an upward trajectory of democratization. The jailing of the Reuters reporters and the atrocities against Rohingya exemplify the democratic backsliding that has quelled the euphoria that greeted Aung San Suu Kyi in 2015 when she led her party to a landslide election victory. This chapter explains the broader political context to assess the implications of this miscarriage of justice on press freedom and Myanmar’s fragile democratic transition. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Tina Burrett and Jeff Kingston; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Background: Infants and young children have been identified as the most nutritionally vulnerable group in catastrophic situations such as earthquakes. Malnutrition and poor feeding practices during the early years of life could adversely affect child’s growth, cognitive, physical and social development. Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess and compare nutritional status and related factors among 6-48 months old children born in the damaged rural and urban areas of Varzeghan after the 2012 earthquake. Methods: 250 children between 6-48 months living in Varzeghan and 60 damaged villages participated in this cross-sectional descriptive study. Anthropometric data were gathered and the three indices of malnutrition, wasting (weight/height), underweight (weight/age) and stunting (height/age) were calculated and assessed according to z-score. These data were compared with the documented files gathered in health institutes before the earthquake. Results and Conclusion: There were statistically significant differences in wasting, underweight and stunting before and after the earthquake in different areas. The most prevalent nutritional complications according to z-score<-2 were wasting (8.8%), underweight (6.4%) and moderate-severe stunting (2.8%), respectively. The prevalence of wasting (12.8% vs. 4.2%) and underweight (8.4% vs. 2.1%) in different areas was higher in girls in comparison to boys. This study provides evidence that natural disasters inversely effect children’s nutritional health. Thus, since malnutrition still remains one of the main public health challenges in Iran and some other developing countries it is crucial to precisely assess and implement accurate intervention procedures to ensure the needs of all age groups especially young children. © Mattioli 1885

AB  - Introduction and objective. The tendency towards postponement of maternity implies a greater exposure of female germ cells to damaging environmental effects, including ionizing radiation (IR). Progress in paediatric oncology, based on the use of radiotherapy, also implies the occurrence of gonadal dysfunctions and subsequent female fertility disorders. Therefore, it seems justifiable to systematize the state of knowledge concerning the effect of IR on the female reproductive system. Brief description of the state of knowledge. A considerable part of studies concerning the effect of IR on female germ cells have been conducted on animals. Their extrapolation to humans is hindered because in animal studies high acute exposures are applied, which do not reflect human environmental exposures characterized by chronic low dose exposure. Studies on animals provide a heterogenous image, which hinders the formulation of unequivocal conclusions and indicates that radiosensitivity depends, i.a. on IR dose, stage of development of oocytes, the applied marker of the effects of IR, or on the species. LD50 of human oocytes is estimated to be below 2 Gy. The effect of IR depends, i.a. on the dose fractionation and the age (older women are more radiosensitive). In females, the effective sterilizing dose is: at birth 20.3 Gy, at 10 years 18.4 Gy, at 20 years 16.5 Gy, whereas at 30 years 14.3 Gy, which is associated with the available pool of ovarian follicles. Conclusions. Within the range of low doses received as a result of environmental exposure to IR, there is no evidence for the occurrence of either adverse pregnancy outcomes, nor fertility disorders in females. These effects may be related to the cancer radiotherapy, or exposure to high IR doses during nuclear accidents. © 2019, Institute of Agricultural Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB  - The relevance of the research is due to the complexity of the stage of exploratory data analysis and hypotheses for further verification by methods of statistical and/or data mining. Objective: to apply methods of visual analysis and cognitive visualization for exploratory analysis and advance preliminary hypotheses in the process of analyzing the dynamics of stillbirth of boys and girls in all areas of the Bryansk region with different density of radioactive contamination by long-lived radionuclides Cesium-137 (137Cs) and Strontium-90 (90Sr), on the basis of official statistics for the long-term period (1986-2016). Research methods: visual analytics and cognitive visualization, mathematical statistics: Shapiro-Wilk test, Student t-test, homoscedasticity test, linear regression. Research results: the research results confirm the feasibility of using methods of visual analytics and cognitive visualization for exploratory analysis and advancement of preliminary hypotheses. The use of cognitive visualization in the process of exploratory data analysis allows the researcher to better understand the main trends and patterns in the analyzed data. This makes it possible to reduce the time required to form hypotheses by two to three times and to improve the quality of the hypotheses put forward. © © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Background: Bangladesh is exposed to natural hazards such as floods, cyclones and droughts. As such, its health systems and health infrastructure are exposed to recurrent disasters. Research studying the impacts of natural disasters on reproductive health in particular is lacking. This research contributes to this knowledge gap by studying the challenges related to menstrual regulation and post-abortion care at both the facility and community levels, and the care-seeking patterns of pregnant women during the 2016 flood in Belkuchi, Bangladesh. Methods: Six government-run primary health care facilities were assessed using a structured assessment tool prior to the flood of 2016. In total, 370 structured interviews were conducted with women in three unions of Belkuchi (Belkuchi Sadar, Daulatpur and Bhangabari) 4 months after the 2016 flood. Results: The main challenges at the facility level are a lack of services and a shortage of medicines, equipment and trained health workers. The main challenges at the community level are displacement, high rates of self-diagnosed spontaneous abortion and a lack of treatment for post-abortion complications. A majority of the interviewed women (48%) sought menstrual regulation from the residence of a nurse or family welfare visitor. In total, 73.2% of the women who experienced post-abortion complications sought medical care. Conclusion: To overcome the challenges at the facility level, it is important to construct flood-resistant health infrastructure and train health workers in menstrual regulation and post-abortion care, so that these services can be made available during a flood. At the community level, more research is required to understand the reasons for spontaneous abortions so that these, and the subsequent chronic conditions/complications women experience, may be avoided. Context specific interventions that can overcome local challenges (both at the community and facility levels) are required to promote disaster resilience at primary health care facilities. © 2019 Ray-Bennett NS et al.

AB  - Consistent with the paradigm shifting observations of David Bar ker and colleagues that revealed a powerful relationship between decreased weight throu gh 2 years of age and adult disease, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and prete rm birth are independent risk factors for the development of subsequent hypertension. An imal models have been indispensable in defining the mechanisms responsible for th ese associations and the potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Among the m odifiable risk factors, micronutrient deficiency, physical immobility, exaggerated stress hormone exposure and deficient trophic hormone production are leading candidates for targeted therapies. With the strong inverse relationship seen between gestational age at delivery and the risk of hypertension in adulthood trumping all other major card iovascular risk factors, improvements in neonatal care are required. Unfortunately, ther apeutic breakthroughs have not kept pace with rapidly improving perinatal survival, a nd groundbreaking bench-to-bedside studies are urgently needed to mitigate and ultimate ly prevent the tsunami of prematurity-related adult cardiovascular disease that may be on the horizon. This review highlights our current understanding of the developmental origi ns of hypertension and draws attention to the importance of increasing the availabilit y of lactation consultants, nutritionists, pharmacists and physical therapists as critical allies in the battle that IUGR or premature infants are waging not just for survival but also for their future cardiometabolic health. © 2019 Society for Endocrinology Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.

TI  - Sudden unexpected death and the mammalian dive response: Catastrophic failure of a complex tightly coupled system

IS  - FEB
AB  - In tightly coupled complex systems, when two or more factors or events interact in unanticipated ways, catastrophic failures of high-risk technical systems happen rarely, but quickly. Safety features are commonly built into complex systems to avoid disasters but are often part of the problem. The human body may be considered as a complex tightly coupled system at risk of rare catastrophic failure (sudden unexpected death, SUD) when certain factors or events interact. The mammalian dive response (MDR) is a built-in safety feature of the body that normally conserves oxygen during acute hypoxia. Activation of the MDR is the final pathway to sudden cardiac (SCD) in some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), and sudden cardiac death in water (SCDIW, fatal drowning). There is no single cause in any of these death scenarios, but an array of, unanticipated, often unknown, factors or events that activate or interact with the mammalian dive reflex. In any particular case, the relevant risk factors or events might include a combination of genetic, developmental, metabolic, disease, environmental, or operational influences. Determination of a single cause in any of these death scenarios is unlikely. The common thread among these seemingly different death scenarios is activation of the mammalian dive response. The human body is a complex tightly coupled system at risk of rare catastrophic failure when that “safety feature” is activated. © © 2019 Vincenzi.

AB  - Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of the adopted strategy and the care quality for pediatric trauma in the survival of patients attended after a disaster in a city in the interior of Minas Gerais state, compared to the expected results of studies on infant mortality in major burns. Methods: retrospective observational analysis of ten patients who were burned and transferred to a trauma reference center. We used the modified R-Baux score to estimate the expected mortality. We compared the expected mortality predicted by R-Baux score and the actual mortality determined from one-ratio test. We also compared time of post-trauma admission with mortality and burned body surface area with mortality. Results: mean R-Baux score was 75.2, which means an expected mortality of 5% among major burn patients. However, in this study, mortality in the group of children with large burned body surface area was of 60%, p=0.001, a rate far beyond that expected in literature. Conclusion: despite the innumerable variables, we consider the hypothesis of the pediatric trauma care infrastructure being inferior than the one needed in the state. This study suggests a greater incentive for public policies concerning pediatric trauma care, prepared referral center, well-established transfer agreements, and optimization of catastrophe plans, in order to reduce morbimortality of patients who survive the first hour after trauma. © 2019, Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes.

AB  - Background: Limited access to safe, timely banked blood is a critical barrier to providing basic surgical care in resource-limited settings globally. Contextual, locally driven data are required to elucidate country needs, develop effective interventions, and guide policy decisions. Objective: We employ qualitative methodology to describe barriers faced and solutions proposed by front-line obstetric providers in Bihar–a poor, populous Indian state where maternal mortality exceeds the national average. We aim to make locally driven recommendations for ongoing policy work in India to strengthen the country’s blood transfusion system. Methods: From February to May 2016, two researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 obstetric providers across Bihar. Snowball sampling was employed until thematic saturation was reached. Following immersion into de-identified texts and dual codebook development, a primary analyst completed topical coding, and a secondary analyst confirmed reproducibility. Results: Providers report that pervasive banked blood shortages force hospitals to require replacement donation, but patients’ families often cannot or will not donate. Providers wait one to six hours for blood, depending on availability of staff and supplies, blood bank proximity, and the ability of the patient being treated to navigate the system. Providers feel forced to refer their patients, often to distant, poorly equipped centers. Providers identify donor education, improved infrastructure, and improved local coordination as focus areas for intervention. Conclusions: A multi-stakeholder approach that aims to increase blood donation through community education, mitigate limited infrastructure through short-term workarounds, and improve local-level coordination through state support and policy change is required in Bihar. This study generates data to guide policy and future research aimed at generating affordable, contextually appropriate interventions to the blood drought. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Oil spills can lead to irreversible environmental degradation and are a potential hazard to human health. We study how onshore oil spills affect neonatal and infant mortality by combining spatial data from the Nigerian Oil Spill Monitor with Demographic and Health Surveys. To identify a causal effect, we compare siblings born to the same mother, conceived before and after a nearby oil spill. We find that nearby oil spills that occur before conception increase neonatal mortality by 38.3 deaths per 1,000 live births, which corresponds to an increase of around 100% on the sample mean. The effect is fairly uniform across girls and boys, socio-economic backgrounds, and locations. We show that this effect is not driven by events related to oil production or violent conflict. Rather, our results are consistent with medical and epidemiological evidence showing that exposure to hydrocarbons can pose risks to fetal development. We provide further evidence suggesting that the effects of oil spills on neonatal mortality persist for several years after the occurrence of an oil spill. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the impacts of maternal exposure to acute episodes of outdoor air pollution, such as that resulting from wildfires, on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. This systematic review aims to synthesise the existing literature exploring the relationship between maternal exposure to short-to medium-term changes in outdoor air quality and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed articles using PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, ProQuest, GreenFILE and Scopus was conducted in January 2018 using selected search terms. Quality of included studies were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Results: Eleven studies were included; eight assessed the impact of maternal exposure to air pollution exacerbation events, such as wildfires, oil well fires and volcanic eruptions, and three assessed the impact of improvement events, such as the 2018 Beijing Olympics and closure of industrial activities, on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Studies were highly heterogenous in methodology. Six studies found a significant association between acute changes in air quality and markers of fetal growth restriction, while two did not. Three studies found an adverse association between acute changes in air quality and markers of gestational maturity, and one did not. Conclusion: Overall, there is some evidence that maternal exposure to acute changes in air quality of short-to medium-term duration increases the risk of fetal growth restriction and preterm birth. The relationship for other adverse obstetric or neonatal outcomes is less clear. Exposure of pregnant women to abrupt changes in air quality is linked to fetal growth restriction and possibly preterm birth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Study Objective: To evaluate fertility, pregnancy, and clinical outcomes after uterine arteriovenous malformation (UAVM) management. Design: Single-center retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification III). Setting: One referral center. Patients: Twenty-two patients with a UAVM diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography or computed tomography angiography and managed by expectant management (EM) or uterine arterial embolization (UAE) during the study period were included. Interventions: Nine of 22 patients underwent first-intention EM and 13 first-line UAE. Three of 9 EM patients (33.3%) required emergency second-intention UAE for nonresolution of the UAVM and severe genital bleeding. Measurements and Main Results: To analyze fertility according to management approach, we defined 2 groups: EM only group (n = 6) and UAE group (n = 16; women who underwent first- or second-intention UAE). Overall, the median age was 29 years (range, 17–43). The mean follow-up after UAVM management was 39 months (range, 1–116). The success rate of the UAE procedure was 87.5% (14/16). Eight of 12 women (66.7%) who wished to conceive became pregnant: 2 of 5 (33.3%) in the EM group and 6 of 7 (85.7%) in the UAE group (p = 1). Overall, 11 patients (50%) conceived: 3 in the EM group (50%) and 8 in the UAE group (50%) (p =.9). The live birth rate was 36.4% (8/22) for the whole population. There were no miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies. The 8 women (72.7%) wishing to conceive who became pregnant all delivered: 1 by cesarean section and 7 by vaginal delivery. Median duration of pregnancy was 39 weeks and 5 days. The remaining 3 women (i.e., women who conceived but did not wish to become pregnant) had therapeutic abortions. One complication was experienced in the EM group (small for gestational age newborn) and none in the UAE group (p =.3). Limitations include retrospective design and small sample size. Conclusion: UAE for UAVM is an effective and safe technique. It does not impair fertility, and obstetric prognosis is good. © 2018 AAGL

AB  - Death, disease and disaster can inflict anyone, anywhere and at any time. While occurrence of such an event could be absolved of any selective strike, the outcome reflects otherwise. Historical deprivations experienced by certain populations have caused more bereavement and sorrow to them than those who have experienced lesser or no deprivation. Therefore, the process which shapes the factors to yield such a result is important and needs to be understood for any policy suggestions and programmatic inputs. Loss of pregnancy and newborn inflicts sorrow and bereavement across space, time and social labyrinth. The degree of bereavement is likely to reduce with time, but space and social context govern the response to it. Therefore, factors contributing to the differentials vary in their demographic, social and economic characteristics. The loss of pregnancy and newborn remains inadequately addressed. Family and community play a significant role in coping. While the developed countries have institutional structure to address coping with the loss, the South Asian countries rely heavily on the family and the community for such support. The present review examines these trajectories across social groups. © 2019 Indian Journal of Medical Research.

AB  - Estimation of maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in humanitarian settings (â € settings of conflict, displacement and natural disaster') is challenging, particularly where communities have dissolved and geographical areas are inaccessible. During humanitarian events, the reproduction of maternal mortality figures by the media is common, and are often based on inaccurate reports. In light of such uncertainties and challenges, the aim of this article was to review and appraise the methodology and data collection tools used to measure MMR in humanitarian settings. A critical review of both grey and peer-review publications was conducted, focussing on articles published from January 1995 until December 2016. In the final review, articles that provided an estimate of MMR from a humanitarian setting were included. The assessment of study quality was based on an adapted framework for the quality of mortality studies in humanitarian settings. Overall, 13 peer-review publications and one grey publication were included in the final review. These were grouped according to settings: camp, clinic, household and census. Studies varied in their definition of MMR, and few studies objectively defined the humanitarian setting. Household-based studies were based on retrospective designs and on the recall of surviving family members. Although many studies attempted to purposively sample the populations afflicted, there was substantial evidence of selection bias; few studies were able to confirm the maternal deaths through medical certificates, or attempted to visit homes to re-inquire about deaths using verbal autopsy. The variation in methods and tools applied suggest that maternal mortality estimates are more likely to be markedly different from the true unknown level. The implications are that a standardized methodology and tools are necessary: That are consistent in definition, use a representative sample where possible, attempt to triangulate and validate data sources, and reconfirm deaths through household visits with informant interviews. © The Author 2018.

AB  - The preterm birth (PTB) rate for singletons born in the tropical Caribbean island Puerto Rico increased from 11.3% in 1994, which was comparable to rates in the U.S., to as high as 18.3% in 2006 before decreasing to 15.5% in 2012. A few studies have reported that weather extremes are associated with higher risk of preterm birth, however, the effects of ambient temperature and precipitation has not been well examined in Puerto Rico. We compiled child birth data from the National Center for Health Statistics and weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from 1994 to 2012. We explored the association between the weather factors and PTB rates with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM). We did not find direct association of lagged effect of temperature on birth outcome over monthly timescales. Both high intensity and frequency of precipitation and high frequency of storm and flood events are associated with increased risk of PTB rates. While the weather factors do not explain the marked increase and decrease in PTB rate, we emphasize the negative effects on PTB from weather extremes particularly precipitation in Puerto Rico. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - A 1976 chemical factory explosion near Seveso, Italy exposed residents to high levels of 2,3,7,8-tetracholorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin). Dioxin is a known human carcinogen and potent endocrine disruptor. It is highly lipophilic and has a long half-life in humans. Much of what we know and can learn about the risks of dioxin exposure on human health arose from the tragic circumstances of Seveso. This review aims to describe the Seveso accident, summarize the results of 40 years of research on the health of the Seveso population since the accident, and discuss next-stage research on the health of Seveso residents, their children, and grandchildren. © 2018

AB  - Fear of infectious disease often motivates people to protect themselves. But, it can also produce negative bio-social-psychological effects whose severity is on par with those of the disease. The WHO declaration of Zika as a world health crisis presented an opportunity to study factors that bring about fear. Beginning nine days after the WHO announcement, data were gathered from women aged 18–35 living in the southern United States (N = 719). Respondents reported experiencing fear of Zika at levels akin to those reported following other significant crises/disasters (e.g., the terrorist attacks of 9/11). Fear increased as a function of (1) personal, but not other-relevance, (2) frequency of media exposure, but not media content, and (3) frequency of interpersonal exposure and interpersonal content. It is argued that media and interpersonal message sources may be innately predisposed to amplify, rather than attenuate, risk. © 2018 Society for Risk Analysis

AB  - The extensive literature review on human epidemiological studies suggests that low dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) (≤100 mSv) or low dose rate ionizing radiation (LDRIR) (<6mSv/H) exposure could induce either negative or positive health effects. These changes may depend on genetic background, age (prenatal day for embryo), sex, nature of radiation exposure, i.e., acute or chronic irradiation, radiation sources (such as atomic bomb attack, fallout from nuclear weapon test, nuclear power plant accidents, 60Co-contaminated building, space radiation, high background radiation, medical examinations or procedures) and radionuclide components and human epidemiological experimental designs. Epidemiological and clinical studies show that LDIR or LDRIR exposure may induce cancer, congenital abnormalities, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, cognitive and other neuropsychiatric disorders, cataracts and other eye and somatic pathology (endocrine, bronchopulmonary, digestive, etc). LDIR or LDRIR exposure may also reduce mutation and cancer mortality rates. So far, the mechanisms of LDIR- or LDRIR -induced health effect are poorly understood. Further extensive studies are still needed to clarify under what circumstances, LDIR or LDRIR exposure may induce positive or negative effects, which may facilitate development of new therapeutic approaches to prevent or treat the radiation-induced human diseases or enhance radiation-induced positive health effect. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objectives To examine associations between access to medical care, geological data, and infant and child mortality in the area of North-Eastern Japan that was impacted by the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami (GEJET) in 2011. Design A population-based ecological study using publicly available data. Setting Twenty secondary medical areas (SMAs) in the disaster-affected zones in the north-eastern prefectures of Japan (Iwate, Fukushima and Miyagi). Participants: Children younger than 10 years who died in the 20 SMAs between 2008 and 2014 (n=1 748). Primary and secondary outcome measures: Multiple regression analysis for infant and child mortality rate. The mean values were applied for infant and child mortality rates and other factors before GEJET (2008-2010) and after GEJET (2012-2014). Results Between 2008 and 2014, the most common cause of death among children younger than 10 years was accidents. The mortality rate per 100 000 persons was 39.1±41.2 before 2011, 226.7±43.4 in 2011 and 31.4±39.1 after 2011. Regression analysis revealed that the mortality rate was positively associated with low age in each period, while the coastal zone was negatively associated with fewer disaster base hospitals in 2011. By contrast, the number of obstetrics and gynaecology centres (β=-189.9, p=0.02) and public health nurses (β=-1.7, p=0.01) was negatively associated with mortality rate per person in 2011. Conclusions In 2011, the mortality rate among children younger than 10 years was 6.4 times higher than that before and after 2011. Residence in a coastal zone was significantly associated with higher child mortality rates. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

AB  - Sero-epidemiological studies of brucellosis in the Afar Region showed that the disease is prevalent in livestock. However, there is little information regarding the pastoral community members’ awareness about brucellosis as a cause of abortion in animals and its zoonotic importance. In this study, we assessed knowledge and perception of pastoral community members about brucellosis as a cause of abortion in animals and its zoonotic importance in Amibara district, Afar Region, Ethiopia. Between October and December 2016, a total of 475 study participants (age range 18–80 years, mean age 35.9 years) were interviewed about abortion in their animals, its causes, and diseases that can be transmitted to humans through consumption of raw milk. Almost all (97.7%) of the study participants reported that abortion in animals, especially in goats, is a major problem in the area, and they mentioned that disease (44.6%), drought (58.4%) and fly bites (29.5%) as the main causes of abortion. The study participantsalso thought that malaria (42.9%) and bovine tuberculosis (19.3%) can be transmitted to humans through consuming raw milk. Five respondents (4.2%) mentioned brucellosis (locally known as “hahayita”) as a disease that can be transmitted through frequent consumption of raw milk. The majority (91.9%) mentioned malaria as a cause of febrile illness in humans and 16 (4.4%) participants mentioned brucellosis as a cause of febrile illness. Some participants also mentioned brucellosis as a cause of joint swelling (hygroma) in cattle. In conclusion, the pastoral community members in the present study area lack clear understanding about brucellosis as one of the diseases that cause abortion in their animals and its zoonotic importance. There is a need to create awareness about the zoonotic and animal health importance of brucellosis through various means such as community health extension/veterinary workers and community leaders. © 2018 Legesse et al.

AB  - This paper investigates the persistent effects of negative shocks in utero and in infancy on low-income children's health and cognitive outcomes and examines whether timing of exposure matters differentially by skill type. Specifically, I exploit the geographic intensity of extreme floods in Ecuador during the 1997–1998 El Niño phenomenon, which provides exogenous variation in exposure at different periods of early development. I show that children exposed to severe floods in utero, especially during the third trimester, are shorter in stature five and seven years later. Also, children affected by the floods in the first trimester of pregnancy score lower on cognitive tests. Additionally, I explore potential mechanisms by studying health at birth and family inputs (income, consumption, and breastfeeding). I find that children exposed to El Niño floods, especially during the third trimester in utero, were more likely to be born with low birth weight. Furthermore, households affected by El Niño suffered a decline in income, total consumption, and food consumption in the aftermath of the shock. Falsification exercises and robustness checks suggest that selection concerns such as selective fertility, mobility, and infant mortality do not drive these results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Human infections with Serratia spp. are generally limited to Serratia marcescens and the Serratia liquefaciens complex. There is little data regarding the infections caused by the remaining Serratia spp., as they are seldom isolated from clinical specimens. Methods: In this health care setting in Kathmandu, Nepal routine blood culture is performed on all febrile patients with a temperature >38°C or when there is clinical suspicion of bacteremia. During 2015 we atypically isolated and identified several Serratia spp. We extracted clinical data from these cases and performed whole genome sequencing on all isolates using a MiSeq system (Ilumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Results: Between June and November 2015, we identified eight patients with suspected bacteremia that produced a positive blood culture for Serratia spp., six Serratia rubidaea and five Serratia marcescens. The S. rubidaea were isolated from three neonates and were concentrated in the neonatal intensive care unit between June and July 2015. All patients were severely ill and one patient died. Whole genome sequencing confirmed that six Nepalese S. rubidaea sequences were identical and indicative of a single-source outbreak. Conclusions: Despite extensive screening we were unable to identify the source of the outbreak, but the inferred timeline suggested that these atypical infections were associated with the aftermath of two massive earthquakes. We speculate that deficits in hygienic behavior, combined with a lack of standard infection control, in the post-earthquake emergency situation contributed to these unusual Serratia spp. outbreaks. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Despite of medical disaster caused by thalidomide in 1960s, the drug came to clinical use again for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and multiple myeloma. Recently, a new generation of children affected by thalidomide intake by their mothers during pregnancy has been identified in Brazil. In the past few years, there is the great enhancement in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and targets of thalidomide with the help of modern OMICS technologies. However, understanding of cardiac-specific anomalies in fetus due to thalidomide intake by the respective mother has not been explored fully. At organ level, thalidomide causes congenital heart diseases, limb deformities in addition to ocular, and neural and ear abnormalities. The period of morning sickness and cardiogenesis is synchronized in pregnant women. Therefore, thalidomide intake during the first trimester could affect cardiogenesis severely. Thalidomide intake in pregnant women either causes miscarriage or heart abnormalities such as patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), and pulmonary stenosis in survivors. In the present study, we identified a novel morphological defect (lump) in the heart of thalidomide-treated chick embryos. We characterized the lump at morphological, histo-pathological, oxidative stress, electro-physiological, and gene expression level. To our knowledge, here, we report the very first electrophysiological characterization of embryonic heart affected by thalidomide treatment. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Japan Environment and Children’s Study (JECS) is nationwide birth cohort study that was initiated in January 2011 to investigate the effect of environmental factors on children’s health. Soon after the JECS started, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred on March 11, 2011, with subsequent nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, causing catastrophic damage in Fukushima Prefecture. After the disaster, JECS was relaunched to cover all areas in Fukushima Prefecture due to public concern. In this study, we used the results of individuals enrolled in JECS, who gave birth during 2011-2014 in Fukushima Prefecture, to elucidate pregnancy outcomes in Fukushima Prefecture. The study consisted of 12,804 maternal outcomes. We thus found that the prevalence rates of preterm birth < 37 weeks, low birth weight (LBW) < 2,500 g, and LBW < 1,500 g were 5.6%, 9.5%, and 0.8%, respectively; these rates are in accordance with the National Vital Statistics of 2014. The proportion of major anomaly among the newborns was 1.7%, the value of which was lower than other epidemiological studies. This study also found that severe obstetrics outcomes, such as hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and placental abruption, were most frequently seen among teenage mothers with low socioeconomic status. A prefecture-wide birth cohort study following a large-scale disaster may provide valuable information for obstetric care providers and residents to improve obstetric and perinatal care for pregnant women after a disaster. © 2018 Tohoku University Medical Press.

AB  - Meerkats are group-living, insectivorous herpestids in which subordinate members provide extensive care for the dominant female's young. In contrast to some cooperative breeders, subordinate female meerkats are physiologically able to reproduce and occasionally do so successfully; their attempts are more frequently ‘suppressed’ via eviction or infanticide by the dominant female. Spontaneous abortion and neonatal loss occur with some regularity, further negatively impacting reproductive success. Here, we compared the reproductive outcomes and endocrine profiles, including of serum progesterone (P <inf>4</inf> ), serum estradiol (E <inf>2</inf> ), and fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCm), of dominant and subordinate dams residing within their clans in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa. Our study spanned years of drought, which reduced insect abundance and represented a substantial environmental stressor. Meerkat pregnancies were identified at mid-term and culminated either in spontaneous abortions or full-term deliveries, after which pups were either lost prior to emergence from the natal den (usually within 2 days of birth) or emerged at 2–3 weeks. Neonatal loss exceeded fetal loss for all females, and contributed to narrowing the status-related disparity in female reproductive output seen during less arid periods. Although E <inf>2</inf> concentrations were significantly lower in subordinate than dominant females, they were sufficient to support gestation. Absolute E <inf>2</inf> concentrations may owe to androgenic precursors that also attain highest concentrations in dominant dams and may mediate aggression underlying female reproductive skew. Pregnancies terminating in fetal loss were marked by significantly lower P <inf>4</inf> concentrations in mid-gestation and modestly lower E <inf>2</inf> concentrations overall. Consistently high fGCm concentrations further increased across trimesters, particularly (but not consistently) in subordinates and in aborted pregnancies. Environmental stressors may modulate reproductive outcomes in meerkats through their influence on sex steroids and their effects on intragroup competition. The social and eco-physiological factors affecting intraspecific variation in reproductive output, even in obligate cooperative breeders, may be most apparent during extreme conditions, reflecting the benefits of long-term studies for assessing the impact of climate change. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Dust Bowl occurred in the Central Plains states in the United States between 1930 and 1940. Prolonged drought, intense recurrent dust storms and economic depression had profound effects on human welfare. The causes included increased farming on marginal land, poor land management, and prolonged drought. There was a significant increase in the number of cases of measles, increased hospitalization for respiratory disorders and increased infant and overall mortality in Kansas during the Dust Bowl. Recent scientific studies have demonstrated that dust transmits measles virus, influenza virus and Coccidioides immitis, and that mortality in the United States increases following dust storms with 2-3-day lag periods. Advances in technology have provided information about the composition of dust and the transfer of microbial pathogens in dust and provided the framework for reducing the economic and health consequences of the next prolonged drought in the United States. © 2018 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation

AB  - Objective: To estimate the change of discharge rate after cryptorchidism surgery between pre- and postdisaster in Japan. Cryptorchidism cannot be diagnosed before birth and is not a factor that would influence a woman's decision to seek an abortion. Therefore, this disease is considered suitable for assessing how the Great East Japan Earthquake and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident (2011) influenced congenital diseases. Materials and Methods: We obtained cryptorchidism discharge data collected over 6 years from hospitals that were included in an impact assessment survey of the Diagnosis Procedure Combination survey database in Japan and used these data to estimate the discharge rate after cryptorchidism surgery before and after the disaster. The 94 hospitals in Japan that participated in Diagnosis Procedure Combination system and had 10 or more discharges after cryptorchidism surgery within successive 6 years covering pre- and postdisaster period (FY2010-FY2015) were involved. The change in discharge rate between pre- and postdisaster was analyzed using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model. Results: Nationwide, a 13.4% (95% credible interval 4.7%-23.0%) increase in discharge rates was estimated. The results of all sensitivity analyses were similar to the reported main results. Conclusion: The discharge rate of cryptorchidism was increased nationwide. The rates of low-weight babies or preterm births, risk factors of cryptorchidism, were almost constant during the study period, and age distribution of the surgery was also not changed, which suggested that the other factors that associated with the disaster increased the incidence of cryptorchidism. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Research shows that continuity of midwifery carer in pregnancy improves maternal and neonatal outcomes. This study examines whether midwifery group practice (MGP) care during pregnancy affects infant neurodevelopment at 6-months of age compared to women receiving standard hospital maternity care (SC) in the context of a natural disaster. Methods: This prospective cohort study included 115 women who were affected by a sudden-onset flood during pregnancy. They received one of two models of maternity care: MGP or SC. The women's flood-related objective stress, subjective reactions, and cognitive appraisal of the disaster were assessed at recruitment into the study. At 6-months postpartum they completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3) on their infants' communication, fine and gross motor, problem solving, and personal-social skills. Results: Greater maternal objective and subjective stress predicted worse infant outcomes. Even when controlling for maternal stress from the flood, infants of mothers who were in the MGP model of maternity care performed better than infants of mothers in SC on two of the five ASQ-3 domains (fine motor and problem solving) at 6-months of age. Furthermore, infants in the SC model were more likely to be identified as at risk for delayed development on these domains than infants in the MGP model of care. Conclusions: Continuity of midwifery care has positive effects on infant neurodevelopment when mothers experience disaster-related stress in pregnancy, with significantly better outcomes on two developmental domains at 6months compared to infants whose mothers received standard hospital care. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The glories of ancient Rome, its creative, awe-inspiring works of architecture and its lavish spectacles and public entertainments, are well documented, but there was a darker side to life in the city as well. Rome's people were subject to all the standard ills found in any big city, and a few others particular to it. While wealth and privilege could partially shelter Rome's elite from some of these perils, others affected all of those who dwelled in the city, rich and poor. Among the more significant and omnipresent of the sundry hazards endured by Rome's inhabitants were six which might be characterized as the six F's: floods, fires, famines, footpads, filth, and fevers. The chapter discusses these six F's in detail. The health hazards in Rome were particularly dangerous to the very old and the very young, and it is no surprise that rates of infant mortality were extremely high in the ancient world. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Wildfires have significant effects on human populations worldwide. Smoke pollution, in particular, from either prescribed burns or uncontrolled wildfires, can have profound health impacts, such as reducing birth weight in children and aggravating respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. Scarcity in the measurements of particulate matter responsible for these public health issues makes addressing the problem of smoke dispersion challenging, especially when fires occur in remote regions. Previous research has shown that in the case of the 2014 King fire in California, crowdsourced data can be useful in estimating particulate pollution from wildfire smoke. In this paper, we show that the previous model continues to provide good estimates when extended statewide to cover several wildfires over an entire season in California. Moreover, adding the semantic information contained in the social media data to the predictive model significantly increases model accuracy, indicating a confluence of social and spatio-temporal data. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - background Humanitarian emergencies increase the risk of gender-based violence (GBV). We estimated the prevalence of GBV victimisation and perpetration among women and men in urban settings across Somalia, which has faced decades of war and natural disasters that have resulted in massive population displacements. Methods A population-based survey was conducted in 14 urban areas across Somalia between December 2014 and November 2015. results A total of 2376 women and 2257 men participated in the survey. One in five men (22.2%, 95% CI 20.5 to 23.9) and one in seven (15.5%; 95% CI 14.1 to 17.0) women reported physical or sexual violence victimisation during childhood. Among women, 35.6% (95% CI 33.4 to 37.9) reported adult lifetime experiences of physical or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) and 16.5% (95% CI 15.1 to 18.1) reported adult lifetime experience of physical or sexual non-partner violence (NPV). Almost one-third of men (31.2%; 95% CI 29.4 to 33.1) reported victimisation as an adult, the majority of which was physical violence. Twenty-two per cent (21.7%; 95% CI 19.5 to 24.1) of men reported lifetime sexual or physical IPV perpetration and 8.1% (95% CI 7.1 to 9.3) reported lifetime sexual or physical NPV perpetration. Minority clan membership, displacement, exposure to parental violence and violence during childhood were common correlates of IPV and NPV victimisation and perpetration among women and men. Victimisation and perpetration were also strongly associated with recent depression and experiences of miscarriage or stillbirth. Conclusion GBV is prevalent and spans all regions of Somalia. Programmes that support nurturing environments for children and provide health and psychosocial support for women and men are critical to prevent and respond to GBV. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

AB  - Floods are the most common type of natural disaster in both developed and developing countries and have led to extensive morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Worldwide, over the past 30 years, flooding has claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people and affected more than 2.8 billion others. The impact of flooding on health varies among populations and depends primarily on vulnerability and the kind of event experienced. It severely disrupts livelihoods and has a significant impact on the health of pregnant women and children. In addition, it may exacerbate a range of negative psychological and physiological child and reproductive health outcomes. Awareness-raising, education, and the issuing of warnings appear to be key initiatives to mitigate or prevent flood morbidity and mortality, especially among people living in low- and middle-income countries. Agencies responding to emergencies also need to be more cognisant of the dangers, specifically those engaged in healthcare, nutrition, and water safety programmes. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Fiji has a high burden of leptospirosis, with endemic infection and epidemic outbreaks with high mortality, often associated with flooding and cyclones. As a zoonosis, leptospirosis control requires interventions in sectors beyond the usual control of health—in Fiji, the dairy and sugar industries, and water and sanitation and rodent control in communities. This paper presents the findings of qualitative research to inform policy around governance for a One Health multisectoral approach to leptospirosis control. Methods: Key informants from relevant government agencies and industry organizations were interviewed in late 2014, and the interviews analyzed and triangulated with documentary analysis. Findings: The analysis identified 5 themes: perceptions of the impact of leptospirosis, governance processes, models for collaboration, leptospirosis control, and preferred leadership for leptospirosis management. Data were limited, with poor communication between ministries, and limited awareness of leptospirosis outside outbreaks. Collaboration during outbreaks was positive but not sustained in endemic periods. Mechanism for enhanced collaboration was developed for endemic and outbreak situations. Conclusion: The findings informed a One Health governance approach to leptospirosis, framed within a National Strategic Plan, with a specific National Action Plan for Leptospirosis. The process provides a research based One Health template for application to other zoonotic diseases. © © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objective Maternal mortality may increase after a disaster. Because midwives are at the frontline of offering reproductive health care services in disasters, they should be competent.Methods This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study carried out in 2015 in Tehran. The sample consisted of 361 midwives selected by use of a cluster random sampling method. Data were collected by using a questionnaire on professional competency for preventing maternal mortality in disasters.Results The midwives' mean professional competency score was 177.74±31, which was an average level of professional competency. The level of knowledge and skills of the midwives was reported as inadequate for most items, particularly for the items of managing mothers affected by chronic diseases, physical trauma, recognizing patients who needed to be referred, and stabilizing mothers when referring them. Statistically significant relationships were observed between the midwives' competencies and age (P=0.001), work experience (P=0.054), educational level (P= 0.043), previous experience in a disaster (P=0.014), and workplace (P=0.006). These data were drawn by using Spearman's correlation, t-test, and ANOVA, respectively.Conclusions Given the average scores for midwives' professional competency in disasters and the inadequacy of prior training courses, extra educational programs for midwives are recommended. © 2017 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.

AB  - Kidney disease has been described as the most neglected chronic disease. Reliable estimates of the global burden of kidney disease require more population-based studies, but specific risks occur across the socioeconomic spectrum from poverty to affluence, from malnutrition to obesity, in agrarian to post-industrial settings, and along the life course from newborns to older people. A range of communicable and noncommunicable diseases result in renal complications and many people who have kidney disease lack access to care. The causes, consequences and costs of kidney diseases have implications for public health policy in all countries. The risks of kidney disease are also influenced by ethnicity, gender, location and lifestyle. Increasing economic and health disparities, migration, demographic transition, unsafe working conditions and environmental threats, natural disasters and pollution may thwart attempts to reduce the morbidity and mortality from kidney disease. A multisectoral approach is needed to tackle the global burden of kidney disease. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) emphasize the importance of a multisectoral approach to health. We map the actions towards achieving all of the SDGs that have the potential to improve understanding, measurement, prevention and treatment of kidney disease in all age groups. These actions can also foster treatment innovations and reduce the burden of such disease in future generations. © 2018, World Health Organization. All rights reserved.

AB  - The deleterious association between various types of prenatal maternal psychological distress (PNMS, anxiety, depression, psychological distress, stress) and childhood anxiety symptomatology (internalizing behaviors, anxiety symptoms) has been established using both retrospective and prospective longitudinal studies across varied demographic cohorts and throughout development. Yet, the existing literature cannot claim maternal distress during pregnancy to be a specific risk factor for anxiety symptomatology, as studies utilizing such observational designs are unable to adequately account for confounding of potential genetic factors and the postnatal environment. In this review, we examine studies that attempt to minimize such confounding and thus disentangle the unique intrauterine exposure effect of varying types of PNMS on childhood anxiety symptomatology. Such methodologies include paternal versus maternal comparison studies, sibling comparisons, prenatal cross-fostering designs and timing of exposure studies (including disaster studies). Of the identified studies, findings indicate that prenatal maternal distress is likely to constitute a risk factor for anxiety symptomatology, although more studies are needed to replicate current findings in order to determine whether there are clear differences in effects across specific types of PNMS and for specific subpopulations. We review the methodological limitations and strengths of the literature prior to exploring avenues of future research and implications for theory and clinical practice. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Tropical cyclones cause widespread devastation while having a negative impact on human health and well-being. Maternal exposure to prenatal environmental stressors can lead to a shift in reproductive strategies. This study aims to statistically analyse maternal and infant health risks by studying birth outcomes following maternal prenatal exposure to tropical cyclone Yasi in Queensland, Australia. Queensland state birth records collected under the Australian National Perinatal Data Collection from January 2008 to December 2012 were analysed. A confounder controlled binary logistic regression model was used to statistically compare birth weight and gestation length in cyclone Yasi affected and unaffected Queensland local government areas (LGAs). Women in cyclone Yasi affected LGAs, had a significantly higher proportion (9.6%, p = 0.008) and significantly higher odds (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.06 – 1.47) of having a preterm birth, compared to women in unaffected LGAs (7.9%). Women in affected LGAs during the year of cyclone Yasi (2011) also had a higher proportion of low birth weight births compared to women in the same LGAs during non-cyclone Yasi years (2008,2009,2010,2012). Our study supported a significant increase in the proportion of preterm births recorded for women pregnant in areas severely affected by cyclone Yasi. Our findings, and similar future research, will continue to inform the development of effective post-disaster perinatal health related policies and the continued improvement of disaster risk mitigation for vulnerable groups. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Regional-scale tree die-off events driven by drought and warming and associated pests and pathogens have occurred recently on all forested continents and are projected to increase in frequency and extent with future warming. Within areas where tree mortality has occurred, ecological, hydrological and meteorological consequences are increasingly being documented. However, the potential for tree die-off to impact vegetation processes and related carbon dynamics in areas remote to where die-off occurs has rarely been systematically evaluated, particularly for multiple distinct regions within a given continent. Such remote impacts can occur when climate effects of local vegetation change are propagated by atmospheric circulation - the phenomena of 'ecoclimate teleconnections'. We simulated tree die-off events in the 13 most densely forested US regions (selected from the 20 US National Ecological Observatory Network [NEON] domains) and found that tree die-off even for smaller regions has potential to affect climate and hence Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) in disparate regions (NEON domains), either positively or negatively. Some regions exhibited strong teleconnections to several others, and some regions were relatively sensitive to tree loss regardless of what other region the tree loss occurred in. For the US as a whole, loss of trees in the Pacific Southwest - an area undergoing rapid tree die-off - had the largest negative impact on remote US GPP whereas loss of trees in the Mid-Atlantic had the largest positive impact. This research lays a foundation for hypotheses that identify how the effects of tree die-off (or other types of tree loss such as deforestation) can ricochet across regions by revealing hot-spots of forcing and response. Such modes of connectivity have direct applicability for improving models of climate change impacts and for developing more informed and coordinated carbon accounting across regions. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with birth outcomes, including birthweight. Exposure to natural disasters during pregnancy provides a model to study these relationships. However, few studies assess both stress and diet, which might have interactive effects. Furthermore, most are conducted in high-income countries. Patterns might differ in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Aim: To study relationships between stress and diet during pregnancy, and infant birthweight, following a natural disaster in a lower-middle income country. Subjects and methods: In 2015, the island nation of Vanuatu suffered a Category 5 cyclone. Three months later, the authors assessed hardship due to the cyclone, distress, and dietary diversity among 900 women, including 187 pregnant women. Of these, 70 had birth records available. Multivariate linear regression was used to analyse relationships between cyclone exposure and infant birthweight among this sub-sample. Results: Neither hardship nor dietary diversity predicted birthweight. Distress was a robust predictor, explaining 8.5% of variance (p = 0.012). There were no interactive relationships between distress and other exposure variables. Conclusions: Maternal distress following a natural disaster has important implications for maternal and child health. In LMICs, low birthweight remains a pressing public health concern. Distress during pregnancy might represent one underlying risk factor. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Uterine rupture is a potentially catastrophic event during child birth leading to maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. This disaster can be preventable, still in India it accounts for 5-10% of all maternal deaths. Aim: Our aim was to analyze the cases of rupture uterus with the objective to propose preventive measures. Method: It is a three year retrospective analysis of uterine rupture cases recorded from 1st June 2010 to 31st May 2013 in Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital Faridkot. Results: A total of 28 cases of rupture uterus were recorded among 2722 deliveries making the incidence of 10.29 per 1000 deliveries. We found close association of previous caesarean section 75%, injudicious use of oxytocin 35.71%, grand multiparity 35.71% and obstructed labour 25% with ruptue uteri. Repair was done in 60.71% and hysterectomy was done in 39.28% of cases. Neonatal outcome was nil in complete rupture. Common maternal complications faced were shock, sepsis and bladder trauma. Conclusion: We just need to upgrade our health system starting from the level of TBA and dai’s creating more awareness among pregnant ladies especially with previous caesarean section. © 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

AB  - How reproductive output changes with age or size is a key life-history trait that can affect which demographic rates most influence population growth. Although many studies have investigated the reproductive ecology of gartersnakes, we know little about reproduction in the threatened Giant Gartersnake, Thamnophis gigas. We used X-radiography to determine reproductive status and estimated fecundity for 73 female T. gigas collected from several regions within the range of this species in the Sacramento Valley of California, USA, and synthesize these data with data from litters born in captivity to improve our understanding of reproduction in this species. Average total litter size determined from X-rays (15.9) and captive-born litters (15.5) are within the ranges reported from other gartersnakes, but captive-born litters had high rates of stillbirth. Only 154 of 202 neonates from captive snakes were born alive, and seven of 13 litters contained at least one stillborn neonate. We found that fecundity was positively related to maternal snout-vent length, and some evidence that larger litters contained smaller neonates. The proportion of X-rayed females that were gravid was 0.50 in 2014, 0.47 in and 2015, and 0.64 in 2016. Central California experienced an exceptional drought from 2012–2015, which may have affected the reproductive output and frequency of T. gigas. Our estimates of reproductive frequency and size-dependent fecundity in T. gigas provide valuable information that can be used in demographic models of this threatened species. Our results demonstrate that X-radiography is a useful, minimally invasive means to study fecundity in wild populations of snakes. © 2018, Malcolm L. McCallum. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: This study was aimed to analyze post-disaster birth outcomes in coastal and inland regions of Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. Methods: Primary data sets were compiled from birth records of obstetric facilities and 12,808 patients were analyzed for baseline birth outcomes by region. Regional risk analysis of the low-birth-weight rate and premature birth rate were conducted using multi-level logistic regression analysis. Results: From overall baseline birth outcomes, a preterm birth rate was 4.6% and low-birth-weight rate was 8.8%. Regional analysis revealed that a preterm birth rate was 3.2% (coastal) and 5.0% (inland), respectively, and the rate of low birth weight was 6.5% in the coastal and 8.5% in the inland region. In the risk analysis of low-birth-weight rate and preterm birth rate, the risk in the coastal region could not be considered any higher than in the inland region (adjusted odds ratio 0.91 [0.73-1.14] and 0.85 [0.46-1.59], respectively). Conclusions: The incidence of preterm birth and low birth weight were not adversely affected by the disaster. Early transfer and intensive medical intervention may have led to those findings. Further survey will be necessary to determine the long-term effects in both mothers and children. © 2018 World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine.

AB  - The current study examined the moderating role of social support in the association between prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) and childhood body mass index (BMI) in the context of the Iowa floods of 2008. In addition, the mediating role of offspring birthweight was examined in the association between PNMS and childhood BMI. We recruited women from eastern Iowa who were pregnant in 2008 when disastrous floods occurred. Self-report measures of PNMS and cognitive appraisal of the flood’s consequences were obtained shortly after the disaster. Social support was assessed during pregnancy. Offspring anthropometric measures were collected at birth and 30 months. Moderated mediation results indicated that greater PNMS predicted greater BMI at age 30 months through effects on higher birthweight as a mediator, but only for participants with low social support. High social support (satisfaction or number) buffered the effect of PNMS or a negative appraisal of the flood on birthweight. The combination of high PNMS or a negative appraisal of the flood’s consequences and low social support resulted in higher offspring birthweight, which predicted greater BMI at 30 months. Providing strong social support to pregnant women following a stressor might buffer the effects of PNMS on offspring birthweight and later obesity. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.

AB  - In January 2014, Freedom Industries spilled 4-methylcyclohexylmethanol, a chemical foaming agent used in coal processing, from a storage facility into the Elk River in West Virginia. This chemical spill, one of the most significant in U.S. history, adversely affected the drinking water supply of over 300,000 individuals in the Charleston, West Virginia Metropolitan area. We use synthetic control methods to estimate the casual effects on macro-economic growth and infant health outcomes from this water crisis. We find a significant decrease in 5-minute Apgar Scores, a measure of how babies fare in the birthing process and outside of the womb, after the chemical spill. We do not find significant effects for infant birthweight or gestational age. We find a statistically insignificant decrease of per capita GDP in the Charlestown, West Virginia area compared to the synthetic control of 3% two years after the chemical spill. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Natural disasters are increasingly causing displacements globally, and such negative impacts of climate change are expected to increase exponentially. Women and girls in particular distinctly endure long-term or gradual harms while in displacement, such as heightened risks of sexual and gender-based violence, including exposure to sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS, maternal mortality, and forced or unwanted pregnancies. This article examines the Philippines as a case study to unveil the growing gendered security threats embodied by disaster-induced displacements. In the aftermath of the disaster caused by supertyphoon Haiyan, which struck in November 2013, the mantra of developing a “disaster-resilient nation” has gained currency among national and international actors in the country. Building on critical feminist political economy analysis, this article argues that the Haiyan postdisaster relief and reconstruction efforts constitute gendered processes that intimately rely on and mobilize women’s unremunerated social reproductive labor, particularly through their role as primary caregivers. Data for this research is drawn from twenty-six interviews with key informants and from secondary sources such as official reports of governmental, nongovernmental, and international humanitarian organizations. The findings underscore the importance of deploying a feminist lens to critique the material and discursive power of “resilience” through which norms of female altruism are harnessed at household and community levels while postdisaster responsibilities are increasingly diverted away from the state. In so doing, resilience discourses may serve to reinforce the structural roots of gendered vulnerability, including political, cultural, and economic barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health services and supplies-thereby undermining bodily autonomy. © 2018 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - Background Antenatal mental health problems are of concern globally not only because of the burden and limits to participation experienced by women but also because of risks for foetal neurocognitive development and adverse birth outcomes. The aim was to describe the indicative prevalence of and risk and protective factors for clinically-significant symptoms of antenatal common mental disorders (CMDs) among women who experienced the 2015 Nepal earthquakes during pregnancy. Methods A population-based cross-sectional study in Bhaktapur, one of 14 districts highly affected by the 2015 Nepal earthquakes. The primary outcome, clinically significant symptoms of CMDs, was ascertained using the Nepali validation of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS-N). In order to investigate potential trauma reactions, a subset of EPDS items as indicators of trauma symptoms was constructed. Standardised instruments and study-specific questions were used to measure potential risk and protective factors. Data were collected in individual structured interviews by trained health researchers. Hierarchical multiple linear regression models were used to establish risk and protective factors for clinically significant symptoms of CMDs and indicators of post-earthquake trauma reaction. Results Overall, 497/498 eligible pregnant women provided complete data. We found that 21.9% (95% CI, 18.4; 25.8) of participants had EPDS-N scores > 12 and another 17.1% (95% CI 13.9; 20.7) scored 10–12 indicating a high prevalence of clinically significant CMD symptoms. In total, 20 factors were included in the final hierarchical multiple linear regression model and together explained 33.3% of the variance in EPDS total scores; seven factors, including earthquake experiences and lifetime experience of intimate partner violence, increased risk and five including having income-generating work and a kind, and encouraging partner were protective. The association between earthquake experiences and the indicators of trauma symptoms was not significant in the hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis. Limitations The EPDS has not yet been formally validated in Nepal for use during pregnancy. Data were collected 6 months post-earthquake, so we were not able to capture the experiences of women who had spontaneous or induced abortions or premature births in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake. Conclusions In addition to the restoration of antenatal and obstetric services, the mental health of women who are pregnant requires specific consideration and interventions after natural disasters. This should take into account the additional adverse impact of violence perpetrated by an intimate partner. © 2017

AB  - Background Natural disasters increase the level population stress, including pregnant women, who can experience prenatal maternal stress, affecting the fetus and triggering perinatal complications, such as low birth weight, smaller head circumference, etc. However, little is known about effects of earthquake on perinatal outcomes. Objective To evaluate the effect of earthquake occurred on February 27, 2010 and perinatal outcomes of Chilean pregnant women, and to examine these effects by timing of exposure during pregnancy and newborn gender. Methods A register-based study was performed using data collected from women who had a vaginal delivery in a large private health center in Santiago, Chile, during 2009 and 2010. The study population was categorized according to exposure to earthquake and timing during gestation. Primary perinatal outcomes were gestational age at birth, birth weight, length and head circumference. Analyses adjusted for gender, gestational age at exposure, parity, maternal age and income. Results A total of 1,966 eligible vaginal deliveries occurred during 2009 and 2,110 in 2010. Birth weight was not affected by the trimester of exposure; however, length, head circumference and gestational age at birth were significantly different according to trimester of exposure and gender of newborn. In multivariable analysis, newborns were shorter by 2 mm, 5 mm and 4.5 mm, if they were exposed during their first, second and third trimester, respectively. Furthermore, newborns had a smaller head circumference by 1.2 mm and 1.5 mm if they were exposed during first and second trimester of gestation. Conclusion In this cohort, exposure to the February 2010 earthquake resulted in earlier delivery and reduced length and head circumference in the offspring. This association varied according to trimester of exposure and fetal gender. Health workers should include exposed to high levels of stress associated with natural disasters when assessing pregnancy risk factors. © 2018 Palmeiro-Silva et al.

AB  - Animal and human studies suggest that prenatal exposure to stress is associated with adverse health outcomes such as type 2 diabetes. Epigenetic modification, such as DNA methylation, is considered one possible underlying mechanism. The 1998 Quebec ice storm provides a unique opportunity to study an independent prenatal stressor on child outcomes. C-peptide is the best measure of endogenous insulin secretion and is widely used in the clinical management of patients with diabetes. The objectives of this study are to determine 1) the extent to which prenatal exposure to disaster-related stress (maternal objective hardship and maternal cognitive appraisal) influences children’s C-peptide secretion, and 2) whether DNA methylation of diabetes-related genes mediates the effects of prenatal stress on C-peptide secretion. Children’s (n = 30) C-peptide secretion in response to an oral glucose tolerance test were assessed in blood at 13½ years. DNA methylation levels of selected type 1 and 2 diabetes-related genes were chosen based upon the genes associated with prenatal maternal objective hardship and/or cognitive appraisal levels. Bootstrapping analyses were performed to determine the mediation effect of DNA methylation. We found that children whose mothers experienced higher objective hardship exhibited higher C-peptide secretion. Cognitive appraisal was not directly associated with C-peptide secretion. DNA methylation of diabetes-related genes had a positive mediation effect of objective hardship on C-peptide secretion: higher objective hardship predicted higher C-peptide secretion through DNA methylation. Negative mediation effects of cognitive appraisal were observed: negative cognitive appraisal predicted higher C-peptide secretion through DNA methylation. However, only one gene, LTA, remained a significant mediator of cognitive appraisal on C-peptide secretion after the conservative Bonferroni multiple corrections. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation could act as an intervening variable between prenatal stress and metabolic outcomes, highlighting the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in response to environmental factors. © 2018 Cao-Lei et al.

AB  - Since antiquity, cot death has been explained as accidental suffocation, overlaying, or smothering. Parents were blamed for neglect or drunkenness. A cage called arcuccio was invented around 1570 to protect the sleeping infant. Up to the 19th century, accidents were registered as natural causes of death. From 1830, accidental suffocation became unacceptable for physicians and legislators, and "natural" explanations for the catastrophe were sought, with parents being consoled rather than blamed. Two assumed causes had serious consequences: Thymus hyperplasia was irradiated, causing thyroid cancer, and the concept of central apnea was widely accepted, which led to home monitors and distracted from epidemiological evidence. Prone sleeping originated in the 1930s and from 1944, it was associated with cot death. However, from the 1960s, many authors recommended prone sleeping for infants, and many countries adopted the advice. A worldwide epidemic followed, peaking at 2‰ in England and Wales and 5‰ in New Zealand in the 1980s. Although epidemiological evidence was available by 1970, the first intervention was initiated in the Netherlands in 1989. Cot death disappeared almost entirely wherever prone sleeping was avoided. This strongly supports the assumption that prone sleeping has the greatest influence on the disorder, and that the epidemic resulted from wrong advice. © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Background: Gestational diabetes insipidus (GDI) is a rare endocrine complication during pregnancy that is associated with vasopressinase overproduction from the placenta. Although increased vasopressinase is associated with placental volume, the regulation of placental growth in the later stage of pregnancy is not well known. Case presentation: A 16-year-old pregnant woman was urgently transferred to our hospital because of threatened premature labor when the Kumamoto earthquakes hit the area where she lived. During her hospitalization, she complained of gradually increasing symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia. The serum level of arginine vasopressin (AVP) was 1.7 pg/mL, which is inconsistent with central DI. The challenge of diagnostic treatment using oral 1-deamino-8-D-AVP (DDAVP) successfully controlled her urine and allowed for normal delivery. DDAVP tablets were not necessary to control her polyuria thereafter. Based on these observations, clinical diagnosis of GDI was confirmed. Pathophysiological analyses revealed that vasopressinase expression was more abundant in the GDI patient's syncytiotrophoblast in placenta compared with that in a control subject. Serum vasopressinase was also observed during gestation and disappeared soon after delivery. Vasopressinase is reportedly identical to oxytocinase or insulin regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), which is an abundant cargo protein associated with the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) storage vesicle. Interestingly, the expression and subcellular localization of GLUT4 appeared to occur in a vasopressinase (IRAP)-dependent manner. Conclusion: Because placental volume may be associated with vasopressinase overproduction in GDI, vasopressinase (IRAP)/GLUT4 association appears to contribute to the growth of placenta in this case. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - I searched the National Institutes of Health MEDLINE database through January 2017 for long-term studies of morbidity and air pollution and cataloged them with respect to cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer, diabetes, hospitalization, neurological, and pregnancy-birth endpoints. The catalog is presented as an online appendix. Associations with PM<inf>2.5</inf> (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm), PM<inf>10</inf> (PM with an aerodynamic diameter <10 μm), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<inf>2</inf>) were evaluated most frequently among the 417 ambient air quality studies identified. Associations with total suspended particles (TSP), carbon, ozone, sulfur, vehicular traffic, radon, and indoor air quality were also reported. I evaluated each study in terms of pollutant significance (yes, no), duration of exposure, and publication date. I found statistically significant pollutant relationships (P < 0.05) in 224 studies; 220 studies indicated adverse effects. Among 795 individual pollutant effect estimates, 396 are statistically significant. Pollutant associations with cardiovascular indicators, lung function, respiratory symptoms, and low birth weight are more likely to be significant than with disease incidence, heart attacks, diabetes, or neurological endpoints. Elemental carbon (EC), traffic, and PM<inf>2.5</inf> are most likely to be significant for cardiovascular outcomes; TSP, EC, and ozone (O<inf>3</inf>) for respiratory outcomes; NO<inf>2</inf> for neurological outcomes; and PM<inf>10</inf> for birth/pregnancy outcomes. Durations of exposure range from 60 days to 35 yr, but I found no consistent relationships with the likelihood of statistical significance. Respiratory studies began ca. 1975; studies of diabetes, cardiovascular, and neurological effects increased after about 2005. I found 72 studies of occupational air pollution exposures; 40 reported statistically significant adverse health effects, especially for respiratory conditions. I conclude that the aggregate of these studies supports the existence of nonlethal physiological effects of various pollutants, more so for non–life-threatening endpoints and for noncriteria pollutants (TSP, EC, PM<inf>2.5</inf> metals). However, most studies were cross-sectional analyses over limited time spans with no consideration of lag or disease latency. Further longitudinal studies are thus needed to investigate the progress of disease incidence in association with air pollution exposure. Implications: Relationships of air pollution with excess mortality are better known than with long-term antecedent morbidity. I cataloged 489 studies of cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer, and neurological effects, diabetes, and birth outcomes with respect to 12 air pollutants. About half of the studies reported statistically significant relationships, more frequently with noncriteria than with criteria pollutants. Indoor and cumulative exposures, coarse or ultrafine particles, and organic carbon were seldom considered. Significant relationships were more likely with less-severe endpoints such as blood pressure, lung function, or respiratory symptoms than with incidence of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, or diabetes. Most long-term studies are based on spatial relationships; longitudinal studies are needed to link the progression of pollution-related morbidity to mortality, especially for the cardiovascular system. © 2018 A&WMA.

AB  - Problem: A lack of proper water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and poor hygiene practices reduce the preparedness and response of health care facilities (HCFs) in low-income countries to infection and disease outbreaks. According to a World Bank Service Provision Assessment conducted in 2007, only 28% of HCFs in Rwanda had water access throughout the year supplied by tap and 58% of HCFs provided functioning latrines.1 This evaluation of services and infrastructure in HCFs in Rwanda indicates that targets for WASH in-country need to be enhanced. Objectives: To present a case study of the causes and management of sepsis during delivery that led to the death of a 27-year-old woman, and propose a WASH protocol to be implemented in HCFs in Rwanda. Methods: The state of WASH services used by staff, caregivers, and patients in HCFs was assessed in 2009 in national evaluations conducted by the Ministry of Infrastructure of Rwanda. Site selection was purposive, based on the presence of both water and power supply. Direct observation was used to assess water treatment, presence and condition of sanitation facilities and sterile equipment in the delivery room, provision of soap and water, gloves, alcohol-based hand rub, and WASH-related record keeping. Results: All healthcare facilities met Ministry policies for water access, but WHO guidelines for environmental standards, including for water quality, were not fully satisfied. Conclusions: The promotion and provision of low-cost technologies that enable improved WASH practices could help to reduce high rates of morbidity and mortality due to infection in low-income countries. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - An interesting contribution shows how post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in pregnancies following stillbirth. Women were found to be vulnerable to PTSD in the pregnancy subsequent to stillbirth, particularly where conception occurs soon after the loss. A pregnancy or a birth following a miscarriage are not necessarily helpful in processing the grief, and the complexity of the reaction to a loss of this nature cannot be simplistically resolved by a new conception. ‘Pregnancy, particularly the first pregnancy, is a crisis point in the search for a female identity, for it is a point of no return, whether a baby is born at the end of term or whether the pregnancy ends in abortion or miscarriage’. Miscarriage can be experienced as an emotional earthquake which deeply undermines the confidence at the heart of women’s identities and, therefore, their creative capacity. © 2010, Casa Editrice Astrolabio-Ubaldini Editore, Roma.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The sustainable development goals include 17 goals, one of which is exclusively related to health. The aim of this study was to assess the status of indicators of sustainable development goals related to health in Iran compared to countries in the region and the WHO countries. Methods: Secondary data were used to examine the status of indicators of sustainable development goals related to health. The data reported by the World Health Organization in 2017, the World Bank, and other available resources at the international levels such as the UN and UNICEF were addressed. The indicators according to which the situation in Iran was below the average of the region were selected for further exploration and analysis. A checklist, which met the research objectives, was used for data collection. Results: The status of the maternal mortality ratio (25 in 100,000 people), incidence of tuberculosis) 16 in 100,000 people), and incidence of malaria (0.5 in 1000 people) was favorable. The indicators with an unfavorable status in Iran compared to the regional average were the mortality due to natural disasters, unintentional poisoning, road traffic injuries, and alcohol consumption per capita. Conclusion: Iran has achieved many SDGs goals; however, there is a need for carefully designed plans for controlling and reducing some indicators. Prioritizing indicators in which Iran has had little success should be taken seriously by decision makers. © 2018, Iranian Epidemiological Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mass casualties can result from natural events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, or floods, or from intentional acts of terrorism. The effects of mass casualties on pregnancy outcomes are largely derived from observational and descriptive studies. Pregnant women seem to be more susceptible to the psychological effects of a mass casualty experience, and the severity of exposure is predictive of the degree of behavioral health effects. A variety of ethical issues arise in domestic or international disaster management. International disaster relief planning echoes similar concerns noted in domestic events, and shares the deficiencies noted in domestic planning with respect to care of obstetric patients. Depending upon the geographic location of an event, access to and care of patients may be hampered by poor infrastructure. Obstetric disaster management planning would benefit from the thoughtful and early involvement of obstetrician-gynecologists. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Published 2019 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Later, a local historian described how the closing of the mine had itself been an ecological disaster. Not only had an industry that employed local workers for nearly 500 years come to an end, reducing the once booming town to a sleepy hamlet, more dependent on foreign tourism than local industry, but such measures as had ever existed to protect the environment had ended as well. Ventilation ceased, so that the many still open entrances and cavities that pocked the region had become sinks of toxic dust. Pumping stopped, so the shafts and galleries slowly flooded, flushing mine tailings still laced with mercury into the rivers and wells that provided the region’s drinking water. The incidences of miscarriage, abnormality and cancer in and around Idrija were many times higher than the national average. For residents, mercury was actually in their blood. © 2019 selection and editorial matter.

AB  - Background: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has had more major armed conflicts (wars) in the past two decades–including 13 wars during 1990–2015–than any other part of the world, and this has had an adverse effect on health systems in the region. Objective: To understand the best health system practices in five SSA countries that experienced wars during 1990–2015, and yet managed to achieve a maternal mortality reduction–equal to or greater than 50% during the same period–according to the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG). Maternal mortality is a death of a woman during pregnancy, or within 42 days after childbirth–measured as maternal mortality ratio (MMR) per 100,000 live births. Design: We conducted a selective literature review based on a framework that drew upon the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) six health system building blocks. We searched seven databases, Google Scholar as well as conducting a manual search of sources in articles’ reference lists–restricting our search to articles published in English. We searched for terms related to maternal healthcare, the WHO six health system building blocks, and names of the five countries. Results: Our study showed three general health system reforms across all five countries that could explain MMR reduction: health systems decentralisation, the innovation related to the WHO workforce health system building block such as training of community healthcare workers, and governments-financing reforms. Conclusion: Restoring health systems after disasters is an urgent concern, especially in countries that have experienced wars. Our findings provide insight from five war-affected SSA countries which could inform policy. However, since few studies have been conducted concerning this topic, our findings require further research to inform policy, and to help countries rebuild and maintain their health systems resilience. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - In my first serious foray into oral history, I focused on the women survivors of an industrial disaster that took the world by storm. On the night of 3 December 1984, as 40 tons of Methyl Iso Cyanate (MIC) leaked from inside the premises of Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL), the Indian Subsidiary of the American-owned Union Carbide Corporation (UCC), the streets of Old Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh in India, turned into a gas chamber. Anyone in the path of the gas was killed or maimed for life. More than three decades later, the site of this human-made environmental disaster continues to be one of the world’s most dangerous “toxic hotspots.”1 Thousands of women, who suffered from gas-related illnesses like lung cancer and liver disease, and children, suffering from various birth defects as a result of genetic mutations in their parents’ reproductive systems, are among the 550,000 people ravaged by the disaster’s fallout. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Katrina Srigley, Stacey Zembrzycki, and Franca Iacovetta; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Simultaneous exposure to natural calamities and conflict shocks is a phenomenon that has been largely understudied. The interplay between natural disasters and conflict shocks can have adverse effects extending beyond the current family members to children in utero. The current paper tries to fill this gap by investigating the impact of floods on pregnancy and birth outcomes across conflict-affected and unaffected districts in Pakistan. Using mother fixed effects strategy in a triple difference framework, the results suggest that in-utero exposure to flood in conflict-affected areas increases the probability of small birth size by 8.1 percentage points. Moreover, exposure to violence in non-flooded districts reduces the likelihood of small birth size by 5.6 percentage points but increase the probability of miscarriage by 3.7 percentage points, thereby suggesting selection into birth. Significant heterogeneities are found across place of residence, income groups, and education levels. © 2018, Pakistan Institute of Development Economics.

AB  - Purpose: To examine whether reported exposure to the Gulf oil spill (2010) was related to reproductive reported miscarriage or infertility. Methods: 1524 women aged 18–45 recruited through prenatal and Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) clinics, and community events were interviewed about their experience of the oil spill and reproductive history. 1434 women had information on outcomes of at least one pregnancy, and 633 on a pregnancy both before and after the spill. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the relationship between contact with oil and economic and social consequences of the spill with postponement of pregnancy, miscarriage, and infertility (time to pregnancy >12 months or reported fertility issues), with adjustment for age, race, BMI, smoking, and socioeconomic status. Results were compared for pregnancies occurring prior to and after the oil spill. Results: 77 (5.1%) women reported postponing pregnancy due to the oil spill, which was more common in those with high contact with oil or overall high exposure (aOR 2.92, 95% CI 1.31–6.51). An increased risk of miscarriage was found with any exposure to the oil spill (aOR, 1.54, 95% CI 1.17–2.02). Fertility issues were more common in the overall most highly exposed women (aOR 1.88, 1.19–2.95), when the data were limited to those with pregnancies before and after. However, no particular aspect of oil spill exposure was strongly associated with the outcomes, and effects were almost as strong for pregnancies prior to the oil spill. Conclusions: The oil spill appears to have affected reproductive decision-making. The evidence is not strong that exposure to the oil spill was associated with miscarriage or infertility. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Introduction: Kazakhstan is included in the list of environmentally vulnerable countries and Kyzylorda oblast in particular. This is due to its geographical, spatial and temporal and socioeconomic features. Materials and methods: As part of the program "Integrated approaches in the management of public health in the Aral region", we have carried out an expertise on many samples of natural environments and products. Samples were selected in accordance with sampling procedures according to regulatory documents by specialists of the Pesticide Toxicology Laboratory. It is accredited by the State Standard of the Republic of Kazakhstan, for compliance with ST RK ISO/IEC 17025-2007 "General requirements for the competence of test and calibration laboratories". Gas chromatograph was used for the determination of residues of organochlorine pesticides. For the determination of dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyl was conducted on the gas chromatomass spectrometer with quadruple detector produce by Agilent Company, USA. To assess the risk, we carried out the mathematical calculations according to the risk of chemicals polluting (No P 2.1.10.1920-04, Russia). Calculation of the carcinogenic risk was carried out with the use of data on the size of the exposure and meanings of carcinogenic potential factors (slope factor and unit risk). Results and discussion: The evaluation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), based on the previous results of the research concerning water, soil and food products, was held in five population settlements in Kyzylorda oblast villages: Ayteke bi, Zhalagash, Zhosaly, Shieli and Aralsk town. Pollution with the POPs in the environmental objects by means of exposition and evaluation of the carcinogenic risk to human health is confirmed by the data of the statistical reporting about some morbidity in Kyzylorda oblast, such as skin diseases and subcutaneous tissue, endocrine system diseases, pregnancy complications etc. Conclusion: The received levels of carcinogenic risks, which were first carried out in the Republic of Kazakhstan in the village of Shieli, meet the third-risk range, which is not acceptable to the life of the population that again shows the problem of the Aral Sea, called the zone of ecological disaster. © 2017 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Objective: The Great East Japan Earthquake and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster occurred on 11 March 2011. We investigated the incidence of SGA (small for gestational age) in the Fukushima Prefecture in newborns delivered by women who were pregnant at the time of the disasters and identified any risk factors for SGA. Methods: Subjects were women who were pregnant at the time of the disasters. Questionnaires were sent to the women who lived in the Hamadori area (seaside and near to the nuclear power plant) at the time of the disasters as well as to a control group of women who lived outside the Hamadori area. The incidence of SGA was compared. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for SGA. Results: In total, 325(5.6%) women had infants with SGA. Neither area nor the trimester of pregnancy at the time of the disasters influenced the incidence of SGA. Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) was higher in the SGA group. PIH was found to be an independent risk factor for SGA. Conclusion: We found no evidence that the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster increased the incidence of SGA in the Fukushima Prefecture. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Large-scale catastrophic events and infectious disease outbreaks highlight the need for disaster planning at all community levels. Features unique to the obstetric population (including antepartum, intrapartum, postpartum and neonatal care) warrant special consideration in the event of a disaster. Pregnancy increases the risks of untoward outcomes from various infectious diseases. Trauma during pregnancy presents anatomic and physiologic considerations that often can require increased use of resources such as higher rates of cesarean delivery. Recent evidence suggests that floods and human-influenced environmental disasters increase the risks of spontaneous miscarriages, preterm births, and low-birth-weight infants among pregnant women. The potential surge in maternal and neonatal patient volume due to mass-casualty events, transfer of high-acuity patients, or redirection of patients because of geographic barriers presents unique challenges for obstetric care facilities. These circumstances require that facilities plan for additional increases in necessary resources and staffing. Although emergencies may be unexpected, hospitals and obstetric delivery units can prepare to implement plans that will best serve maternal and pediatric care needs when disasters occur. Clear designation of levels of maternal and neonatal care facilities, along with establishment of a regional network incorporating hospitals that provide maternity services and those that do not, will enable rapid transport of obstetric patients to the appropriate facilities, ensuring the right care at the right time. Using common terminology for triage and transfer and advanced knowledge of regionalization and levels of care will facilitate disaster preparedness.

AB  - Reconnaissance experience on the past earthquakes indicates that the seismic resistance of a low-rise confined masonry building or reinforced concrete (RC) building with brick infill in Taiwan is insufficient, such as school buildings and street houses. These building is occupied with windows and doors openings along the corridor direction for utilization of lighting and ventilation. However, brick infill walls are arranged in the direction perpendicular to corridor between the each adjacent classroom. Therefore, the seismic behavior on the two directions of a school building is significantly affected by the brick infill. The seismic assessment models of brick infill, such as the preliminary evaluation and seismic detailed assessment, will be discussed in this paper. For the preliminary evaluation, the seismic capacity of a typical school building can be calculated by the lateral strength per unit section area of vertical members in the ground floor. The lateral strength per unit section area of a brick infill confined on four sides by RC frame, for instance, is 3 kgf/cm2. Meanwhile, that of a brick wall pier confined on three sides by RC frame is 2 kgf/cm2. However, for the seismic detailed assessment, the backbone curve model of a vertical member is applied for accurate simulation of the member behavior. Four tests of RC frames with brick infill and seven tests of RC columns with brick wall pier are adopted to verify on the two categories of the existing seismic assessment models of brick infill. Comparison of testing and predicting results, the ultimate base shear strength predicted by preliminary evaluation and detailed assessment is conservative to that by tests. Meanwhile, the basic seismic resistance predicted by both assessment methods is also conservative. Therefore, engineers will not make a miscarriage of evaluation for existing building with insufficient seismic resistance. © 2017, Chinese Institute of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering.

AB  - Ionizing radiation at high doses early in life may cause neurodevelopmental problems. Possible effects of lower doses are, however, controversial. We use carefully collected exposure data for Norway following the Chernobyl accident in April 1986 combined with population-based registries to assess long-term effects of fetal exposure on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Radiation doses were estimated for each Norwegian municipality for each calendar month from May 1986 to April 1989. We established a cohort of all Norwegian pregnancies during the three-year period of radiation measurement and compared them with appropriate unexposed groups. All cohorts were followed into adulthood. Risks of cerebral palsy, mental retardation, schizophrenia, epilepsy, vision or hearing problems, school dropout, and low income were estimated. We also conducted an analysis of mathematics and language grades using siblings born after the exposure period as comparison. There was little evidence of associations between radiation exposure and cerebral palsy, mental retardation, schizophrenia, epilepsy, or hearing or vision problems associated with radiation exposure. (p-values for trend with exposure dose were 0.27, 0.14, 0.83, 0.35 and 0.42.) Slightly more of the exposed failed to complete high school (p = 0.05), but there was no increase in the proportion with low income (p = 0.38). The natural advantage of older siblings over younger siblings in mathematics grades was diminished with exposure of older siblings (p = 0.003), but there was no association of exposure with Norwegian language grades (p = 0.37). There is scant evidence that the low-dose fallout from Chernobyl in Norway increased the risk for serious neurodevelopmental problems. We cannot exclude the possibility of lower mathematics grades with exposure, similar to a report from Sweden. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives: Malnutrition contributes to paediatric morbidity and mortality in disasters and complex emergencies, but summary data describing specific nutritional interventions in these settings are lacking. This systematic review aimed to characterise such interventions and their effects on paediatric mortality, anthropometric measures and serum markers of nutrition. Methods: A systematic search of OVID MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and relevant grey literature was conducted. We included all randomised controlled trials and observational controlled studies evaluating effectiveness of nutritional intervention(s) on defined health outcomes in children and adolescents (0–18 years) within a disaster or complex emergency. We extracted study characteristics, interventions and outcomes data. Study quality was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Results: A total of 31 studies met inclusion criteria. Most were conducted in Africa (17), during periods of conflict or hunger gaps (14), and evaluated micronutrient supplementation (14) or selective feeding (10). Overall study quality was low, with only two high and four moderate quality studies. High- and medium-quality studies demonstrated positive impact of fortified spreads, ready-to-use therapeutic foods, micronutrient supplementation, and food and cash transfers. Conclusion: In disasters and complex emergencies, high variability and low quality of controlled studies on paediatric malnutrition limit meaningful data aggregation. If existing research gaps are to be addressed, the inherent unpredictability of humanitarian emergencies and ethical considerations regarding controls may warrant a paradigm shift in what constitutes adequate methods. Periodic hunger gaps may offer a generalisable opportunity for robust trials, but consensus on meaningful nutritional endpoints is needed. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Iodine 131 (I-131), the principal component of nuclear fallout from the Chernobyl accident, concentrates in the thyroid gland and may pose risks to fetal development. To evaluate this, neonatal outcomes following the accident in April of 1986 were investigated in a cohort of 2582 in utero-exposed individuals from northern Ukraine for whom estimates of fetal thyroid I-131 dose were available. We carried out a retrospective review of cohort members’ prenatal, delivery and newborn records. The relationships of dose with neonatal anthropometrics and gestational length were modeled via linear regression with adjustment for potentially confounding variables. We found similar, statistically significant dose-dependent reductions in both head circumference (−1.0 cm/Gy, P = 0.005) and chest circumference (−0.9 cm/Gy, P = 0.023), as well as a similar but non-significant reduction in neonatal length (−0.6 cm/Gy, P = 0.169). Gestational length was significantly increased with increasing fetal dose (0.5 wks/Gy, P = 0.007). There was no significant (P > 0.1) effect of fetal dose on birth weight. The observed associations of radioiodine exposure with decreased head and chest circumference are consistent with those observed in the Japanese in utero-exposed atomic bomb survivors. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Preterm birth continues to be a problem affecting low-, middle-, and high-income countries, with rates increasing in some areas despite ongoing efforts to reduce the incidence. This emphasizes the need for more effective interventions, particularly if we aim to achieve the broad health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. The current focus on medically-oriented interventions such as reducing nonmedically-indicated induction of labor, cesarean birth, and multiple embryo transfers associated with assisted reproductive technologies, as well as the application of cervical cerclage and use of progesterone therapy, though important, are likely only partial solutions to the complex phenomenon of preterm birth. Preterm birth has multiple etiologies. The biologic mechanisms involved in preterm labor and how it may be triggered are not well understood. There is growing evidence to suggest some of these triggers may also be related to stress and environmental conditions. In this review, we focus on evidence concerning psychosocial (mind) and environmental factors (environment) as well as briefly review the evidence related to maternal and fetal factors (body) associated with the risk of preterm birth, with reference to some of the SDGs. We also assess emerging evidence regarding the interaction of the body, mind, and environment in relation to preterm birth, currently a gap in our knowledge, and how these interactions could impact clinical practice. Findings suggest that multidisciplinary expertise and approaches will be needed to develop effective interventions to address the complex etiologies of preterm birth, as opposed to single-risk-factor mitigation. Clinicians and researchers will play key roles in identifying many of these risk factors and shaping interventions that address this complex issue. Addressing the interlinkages between body, mind, and environment through the integration of research and clinical practice is critical to reducing the risk of preterm birth and contributing to the achievement of the SDGs. © 2017 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives

AB  - Newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are highly vulnerable in disasters due to their need for specialized and highly technical support. It is strongly encouraged to prepare for the most likely disaster scenarios for the NICU. During a disaster, neonatal care providers should maintain situational awareness for decision-making, including available equipment, medication, and staffing. Neonatal care providers also should consider the ethical issues and the psychosocial needs of the families and neonatal care staff.

AB  - Introduction: Eclampsia is one of the most dreaded causes of adverse outcomes of pregnancy worldwide. It is one of the greatest causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality world over. We do not know the prevalence, management outcome, and the devastation caused by this dreaded disease in our center hence the need for this work. Materials and Methods: This is a 7-year retrospective review of all cases of eclampsia managed in Mater Misericordiae Hospital Afikpo, a rural secondary cum referral Catholic Mission Hospital in Afikpo, Ebonyi State in Southeastern Nigeria. Results: The prevalence of eclampsia in our center is 1.12% or one case of eclampsia for every 89 women that delivered in our facility. The majority of the women that had eclampsia in our center 56 (71.8%) were primigravidae. Seventeen women (21.8%) had various antenatal complications with 4 or 23.6% presenting with intrauterine fetal deaths and two (11.8%) each with intrauterine growth restriction, and domestic violence, respectively. Thirty-five or 44.9% of the women were delivered by emergency lower segment cesarean section. Fifteen or 17.9% babies were dead giving a perinatal mortality rate of 174 per 1,000After delivery, and 3 (3.8%) of the women had postpartum hemorrhage. Two women (2.6%) died giving a maternal mortality ratio of 2564 per 100,000 deliveries. Conclusion: Eclampsia is a dreaded obstetric disease with adverse fetal and maternal consequences that are not mitigating, and no effort should be spared in managing it effectively including public enlightenment.

AB  - In the wake of global climate change, it is paramount that breeders use breed types with optimal performance ability. This investigation describes a unique 3-breed composite population of cattle in south Texas composed of Red Angus and tropically adapted Senepol and Tuli breeds. Under a low-input production system, trend analyses revealed that between 2005 and 2015 total direct costs per cow decreased by $180 due largely to reduction of feed costs (−9.40 ± 4.3 $/yr; P < 0.10). Despite years of serious drought, adopting increasingly conservative stocking rates, and decreasing mean weaning weights, profit per cow and per hectare were realized every year. Significant interaction existed between coat type of calf and color of calf and dam for weaning weight (n = 183 calves and 50 dams). For the light calf–light cow color cohort, slick compared with hairy coated calves differed by only 0.31 ± 12.5 kg (P > 0.05). However, where either or both the calf and dam were red colored, a larger combined mean difference of 14.3 ± 5.2 kg (P < 0.05) favored slick over hairy calves. For preweaning traits, estimates of direct and maternal breed additive effects were obtained for all 3 breeds. Direct and maternal heterosis effects for birth weight were negligible (3.1 and 1.6%, respectively). However, direct heterosis effects were more important for weaning weight and preweaning growth of 32.7 kg (12.5%) and 0.074 kg/d (6.7%), although the maternal heterosis effect on weaning weight was small (1.4%). Chi-square analyses revealed (P < 0.01) that about 1.5 times more bull than heifer calves were born (n = 252) when conceived in summer. Overall, results of this experiment warrant further research. © 2017 American Registry of Professional Animal Scientists

AB  - Objective Assess the utility of high fidelity simulation in understanding effectiveness of bag-valve ventilation in a simulated newborn intensive care unit vertical evacuation. Participants A total of 70 participants, (13 teams of 4–6 staff) including physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists and other support personnel participated in a 90-min evacuation sessions. Methods Two wireless high-fidelity newborn mannequins (Gaumand ScientificR) provided real-time data of ventilation support during a NICU evacuation exercise. Trained evaluators also recorded data related to performance. Following the exercises, the simulator data were downloaded and analyzed for rate and consistency of respirations. Results Using the data from the simulators and evaluator comments, it was found the infants received proper airway management during the evacuation only 58% of the time. This study highlights the need for ongoing training for NICU staff around safe, effective, coordinated, and timely care of these fragile newborns in the event of an evacuation. © 2017 Neonatal Nurses Association

AB  - Background: Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specifc mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. Methods: We estimated cause-specifc deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specifc causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specifc deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. Findings: The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72·3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71·2-73·2) of deaths in 2016 with 19·3% (18·5-20·4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8·43% (8·00-8·67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16 - age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1·80 million deaths (95% UI 1·59 million to 1·89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL signifcantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2·89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1·59%) during the same interval. Globally, the fve leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a fner level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. Interpretation: The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and confict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might refect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which efective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems. © © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Detailed assessments of mortality patterns, particularly age-specific mortality, represent a crucial input that enables health systems to target interventions to specific populations. Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 200 million in 2016. Methods: We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15-60 years) using adjusted incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 0.5% and where VR systems were less than 65% complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone. Findings: Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28% in 1970 to a peak of 45% in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5-24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annualised rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates - a measure of relative inequality - increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, at 86.9 years (95% UI 86.7-87.2), and for men in Singapore, at 81.3 years (78.8-83.7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same measure in 2016. Interpretation Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled. © © The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To evaluate pregnancy outcomes of multiparae in women with advanced age (≥35 yr.) after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Methods: Clinical data of 542 pregnant women with prenatal care in Wenchuan during 2008-2013 were reviewed, comparing pre-conception conditions, pregnant rates, pregnant complications, and perinatal outcomes between those younger (n=176) and older (n = 366) than 35 years. Results: In the 542 women, 622 conceptions were reported, with 517 deliveries and 522 live births. The women with advanced age had lower cumulative pregnancy rate (two-year), higher incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, multiple pregnancy, fetal distress, low birth weight and birth defects than their younger counterparts. The younger women also had higher term live birth rate and lower miscarriage rate. But the differences showed no statistical significance. Conclusion: Prenatal care brings similar pregnant outcomes to multiparae in women with advance aged and younger aged.

AB  - I report a case of hypotension and bradycardia before spinal anesthesia in a pregnant woman with mild to moderate hypertension treated with nifedipine and methyldopa, scheduled for an elective cesarean delivery. She had the history of neurally‐mediated syncopes. Two main factors (increased vagal tone and adverse effects of antihypertensive drugs) could explain the hypotension and bradycardia before spinal anesthesia. Monitoring allowed recognizing the problem and corrected it. Thus, it was avoided a disaster in anesthesia, as hemodynamic changes after spinal anesthesia, they would have joined to previous hypotension and bradycardia, which would have caused even a cardiac arrest. © 2015 Sociedade Brasileira de Anestesiologia

AB  - Psychological maternal stress is thought to be a factor in poor infant health, but direct evidence is difficult to obtain. We posit that the 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles, California provides a natural test of the effect of mothers’ stress on infants’ birth weight and gestation. The Northridge disaster featured a low rate of injury and a quick recovery, but long-lasting and well documented consequences for mental health. Difference-in-difference results show that infants born closest to the epicenter were 0.2 percentage points more likely to be born with low birth weight. Impacts were larger and more precisely identified for women who experienced the earthquake in their first or third trimester. Among the subsample of mothers most susceptible to stress – first-time, single mothers – low birth weight was 0.5 percentage points more likely to occur. We find little evidence that the earthquake affected preterm delivery. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective Prenatal hurricane exposure may be an increasingly important contributor to poor reproductive health outcomes. In the current literature, mixed associations have been suggested between hurricane exposure and reproductive health outcomes. This may be due, in part, to residual confounding. We assessed the association between hurricane exposure and reproductive health outcomes by using a difference-in-difference analysis technique to control for confounding in a cohort of Florida pregnancies. Methods We implemented a difference-in-difference analysis to evaluate hurricane weather and reproductive health outcomes including low birth weight, fetal death, and birth rate. The study population for analysis included all Florida pregnancies conceived before or during the 2003 and 2004 hurricane season. Reproductive health data were extracted from vital statistics records from the Florida Department of Health. In 2004, 4 hurricanes (Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne) made landfall in rapid succession; whereas in 2003, no hurricanes made landfall in Florida. Results Overall models using the difference-in-difference analysis showed no association between exposure to hurricane weather and reproductive health. Conclusions The inconsistency of the literature on hurricane exposure and reproductive health may be in part due to biases inherent in pre-post or regression-based county-level comparisons. We found no associations between hurricane exposure and reproductive health. © Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc. 2017.

AB  - Scholarship on the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy tends to treat the Indian judiciary as the site where political, social and legal forces converged to betray survivors seeking redress. But before this judicial failure, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had already politicised the disaster to protect his economic modernisation programme. Recognising the threat the Bhopal tragedy posed to the ideology behind this agenda, Rajiv Gandhi and his advisers pursued multiple strategies to suppress the gas leak's resonance in larger political debates. This laid the groundwork for the courts' later miscarriage of justice and helped shape the disaster's subsequent place in Indian economic history.

AB  - Background Although the literature on effects of armed conflict on population health is extensive, detailed assessments of effects on public health 'systems' are few. This article aims to help address this deficit through the medium of a case study on Yemen, describing health system and health outcome performance prior to the internationalisation of the conflict there in March 2015, before assessing the impact of war on health system functionality since that time. Method Review of peer- and non-peer reviewed literature from 2005 to 2016 from academic sources, multilateral organizations, donors and governmental and non-governmental organizations, augmented by secondary data analysis. Results Despite significant health system weaknesses and structural vulnerabilities pre-conflict, there were important improvements in selected health outcome measures in Yemen up to early 2015 (life expectancy, and infant and maternal mortality, e.g.), partly driven by a fragile health sector that was heavily reliant on out-of-pocket expenditure, and hampered by weak service penetration especially in rural areas. High intensity conflict has resulted in rising mortality and injury rates since March 2015, the first decline in life expectancy and increase in child and maternal mortality in Yemen for some years, and worsening levels of malnutrition. Service delivery has become increasingly challenging in the context of a funding crisis, destruction of health facilities, widespread shortages of essential medicines and equipment across the country, and governance fragmentation. Conclusion Conflict in Yemen has resulted in humanitarian disaster on a wide scale in a short period of time, and crippled an already weak health system. Important areas of uncertainty remain, however, including the scale of health worker flight, and the extent to which alternative providers have stepped in to fill widening service gaps as the conflict has unfolded. Planning for longer-term health system reconstruction should begin as soon as possible. © The Author 2017.

AB  - Adverse infant outcomes often rise in the aftermath of disaster, but few studies have assessed the effects of disaster on maternal health. 1091 southern Louisiana women were interviewed about their pregnancy history, including pregnancy complications. Associations between oil spill exposures and gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, and nausea/vomiting were assessed for all reported pregnancies. 631 women had a pregnancy both before and after the oil spill. Generalized estimating equations (logistic regression) with adjustment for confounders were used. To assess possible unmeasured confounding, instead of considering oil spill exposure as a time-varying exposure, women were defined as oil spill-exposed or not. If oil spill-exposed women were equally prone to complications in pregnancies that occurred prior to the oil spill as after it, it was considered that any associations were likely due to selection or reporting issues. Women who reported oil spill exposure, particularly loss of use of the coast, were more likely to report gestational diabetes; however, the level of association was similar for pregnancies before and after the spill (p for interaction >0.10 and odds ratios (ORs) for pregnancies prior to the spill > than those after the spill). No associations were found between oil spill exposure and hypertensive disorders. This analysis does not suggest an increased risk of pregnancy complications associated with exposure to the oil spill; however, future studies should assess exposure and outcomes prospectively and clinically instead of relying on self-report. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Little research has examined the impact of maternal lifetime trauma exposure on infant temperament. We examined associations between maternal trauma history and infant negative affectivity and modification by prenatal cortisol exposure in a sociodemographically diverse sample of mother–infant dyads. During pregnancy, mothers completed measures of lifetime trauma exposure and current stressors. Third-trimester cortisol output was assessed from maternal hair. When infants were 6 months old, mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised. In analyses that controlled for infant sex and maternal age, education, race/ethnicity, and stress during pregnancy, greater maternal trauma exposure was associated with increased infant distress to limitations and sadness. Higher and lower prenatal cortisol exposure modified the magnitude and direction of association between maternal trauma history and infant rate of recovery from arousal. The association between maternal trauma history and infant distress to limitations was somewhat stronger among infants exposed to higher levels of prenatal cortisol. The analyses suggested that maternal lifetime trauma exposure is associated with several domains of infant negative affectivity independently of maternal stress exposures during pregnancy and that some of these associations may be modified by prenatal cortisol exposure. The findings have implications for understanding the intergenerational impact of trauma exposure on child developmental outcomes. © © International Congress of Infant Studies (ICIS)

AB  - Prenatal maternal stress can adversely affect birth outcomes, likely reflecting effects of maternal stress hormones on fetal development. Maternal stress might also induce behavioural changes, such as dietary change, that might influence fetal development. Few studies have documented relationships between stress and dietary change in pregnancy. We analysed stress and dietary change among 222 pregnant women exposed to the 2011 Queensland Floods. We assessed women's objective hardship, subjective distress and cognitive appraisal of the disaster; changes in their diets and their associations with infants' gestational age, weight, length and head circumference at birth, head circumference to birth length ratio (HC/BL) and ponderal index. Greater objective hardship was correlated with more negative dietary change, skipped meals and skipped multivitamins. There were no direct effects of stress or dietary change on birth outcomes. However, we observed an interactive effect of dietary change and exposure timing on head circumference for gestational age (HC for GA) (p = 0.010) and a similar trend for HC/BL (p = 0.064). HC for GA and HC/BL were larger among children whose mothers experienced negative changes to their diet in early pregnancy compared with later pregnancy, consistent with a ‘head-sparing’ response with early gestation exposure. Further analyses indicated that dietary change mediates the relationship between objective hardship because of the floods and these outcomes. This is the first report of relationships among an independent stressor, dietary change and birth outcomes. It highlights another possible mechanism in the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and child development that could guide future research and interventions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Objective: Adjuvants or alternatives to antibiotics in urinary tract infections (UTIs) during pregnancy seem advisable because of possible fetal stress. The present study assessed the effectiveness of a food supplement containing L-methionine and Hibiscus sabdariffa L. and Boswellia serrata Roxb. extracts as a treatment for symptomatic UTIs in pregnancy. Design: Pregnant patients with symptomatic cystitis were screened for UTIs in three different clinical centers. Those unwilling to take antibiotics were offered two alternative treatments: (A) a 1-week treatment with the food supplement or (B) a week in which they were advised to increase their fluid consumption to more than 1.5 L daily. After 1 week, group B patients who still had positive urine cultures (UCs) or had no UC performed took the food supplement for an additional week. UCs were performed on all patients at the first visit (w0) and on most of them at 7 days (w1). Patients who were still positive at w1 or had no UC performed at w1 had UC performed 14 days (w2) thereafter. Results: Of 264 pregnant women enrolled, 216 joined group A, while 48 joined group B. At w1, 70.0% of group A patients and 43.2% of those in group B had negative UCs (p = 0.003). The reduction of bacterial load was 42.2% ± 8.0% and 4.5% ± 9.2%, respectively (p < 0.0001). At w1, symptoms disappeared in 135 patients (62.5%) in group A and 22 patients (45.8%) in group B (p = 0.03). At w2, 30 of 32 group B patients who switched to taking the supplement for the second week had negative UCs, including 20 who had been positive at w1. At w2, all group A patients had negative UCs. No side effects were reported. Conclusions: The food supplement provided effective treatment and might be an adjuvant or alternative to antibiotic therapy of symptomatic UTI in pregnancy. © 2017 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Analysing child mortality may enhance our perspective on global achievements in child survival. We used data from surveillance sites in Bangladesh, Nicaragua and Vietnam and Demographic Health Surveys in Rwanda to explore the development of neonatal and under-five mortality. The mortality curves showed dramatic reductions over time, but child mortality in the four countries peaked during wars and catastrophes and was rapidly reduced by targeted interventions, multisectorial development efforts and community engagement. Conclusion: Lessons learned from these countries may be useful when tackling future challenges, including persistent neonatal deaths, survival inequalities and the consequences of climate change and migration. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Newborn infants hospitalised in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are vulnerable to natural disasters. However, publications on evacuation from NICUs are sparse. The 2016 Kumamoto Earthquakes caused serious damage to Kumamoto City Hospital and its level III regional core NICU. Local/neighbour NICU teams and the disaster-communication team of a neonatal academic society cooperated to evacuate 38 newborn infants from the ward. Objective: The aim of this paper was to highlight potential key factors to improve emergency NICU evacuation and coordination of hospital transportation following natural disasters. Methods: Background variables including clinical risk scores and timing/destination of transportation were compared between infants, who subsequently were transferred to destinations outside of Kumamoto Prefecture, and their peers. Results: All but 1 of the infants were successfully evacuated from their NICU within 8 h. One very-low-birth-weight infant developed moderate hypothermia following transportation. Fourteen infants were transferred to NICUs outside of Kumamoto Prefecture, which was associated with the diagnosis of congenital heart disease, dependence on respiratory support, higher risk scores, and longer elapsed time from the decision to departure. There was difficulty in arranging helicopter transportation because the coordination office of the Disaster Medical Assistance Team had requisitioned most air/ground ambulances and only helped arrange ground transportations for 13 low-risk infants. Transportation for all 10 high-risk infants (risk scores greater than or equal to the upper quartile) was arranged by local/neighbour NICUs. Conclusions: Although the overall evacuation process was satisfactory, potential risks of relying on the adult-based emergency transportation system were highlighted. A better system needs to be developed urgently to put appropriate priority on vulnerable infants. © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Access to adequate antenatal care (ANC) is critical in ensuring a good maternal health and in preventing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. South Sudan has one of the world’s poorest health indicators due to a fragile health system and a combination of socio-cultural, economic, and political factors. This study was conducted to identify barriers to utilisation of ANC services in Rumbek North County. Methods: Using a qualitative design, data were collected through 14 focus group discussions with 169 women and 45 men and 12 key informant interviews with community leaders, staff working in health facilities, and the staff of the County Health Department. Data were analysed using inductive content analysis. Results: The perceived barriers to ANC utilisation were categorised as follows: 1) Issues related to access to health facilities and lack of resources. These included long distance to health facilities, lack of means of transportation to the health facilities, floods and poor roads, and demand for payment for health care at some health facilities; 2) The influence of the socio-cultural context and conflict including heavy burden of domestic chores, the negative influence of husbands who were reluctant to allow their wives to attend ANC, and insecurity; 3) Perceptions about pregnancy including misperceptions about the benefits of ANC and low perceived risk of pregnancy-related complications; and 4) Perceptions about the quality of care and the efficacy of medical treatment. Conclusions: This study identified a myriad of factors deeply entrenched in the society, which prevent women from utilising ANC services. It also elicits broad aspects of interconnectedness among the barriers. To ensure effectiveness, strategies to improve utilisation of ANC in the study area and in similar contexts need to take into account the barriers identified by this study. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Changes in population birth outcomes, including increases in low birthweight or preterm births, have been documented after natural and manmade disasters. However, information is limited following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Disaster. In this study, we assessed whether there were long-term changes in birth outcomes post-disaster, compared to pre-disaster data, and whether residential area and food purchasing patterns, as proxy measurements of evacuation and radiation-related anxiety, were associated with post-disaster birth outcomes. Maternal and perinatal data were retrospectively collected for all live singleton births at a public hospital, located 23 km from the power plant, from 2008 to 2015. Proportions of low birthweight (<2500 g at birth) and preterm births (<37 weeks gestation at birth) were compared pre- and post-disaster, and regression models were conducted to assess for associations between these outcomes and evacuation and food avoidance. A total of 1101 live singleton births were included. There were no increased proportions of low birthweight or preterm births in any year after the disaster (merged post-disaster risk ratio of low birthweight birth: 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64–1.51; and preterm birth: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.38–1.21). No significant associations between birth outcomes and residential area or food purchasing patterns were identified, after adjustment for covariates. In conclusion, no changes in birth outcomes were found in this institution-based investigation after the Fukushima disaster. Further research is needed on the pathways that may exacerbate or reduce disaster effects on maternal and perinatal health. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background Child mortality as one of the key Millennium Development Goals (MDG 4—to reduce child mortality by two-thirds from 1990 to 2015), is included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3, target 2—to reduce child mortality to fewer than 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths for all countries by 2030), and is a key indicator of the health system in every country. In this study, we aimed to estimate the level and trend of child mortality from 1990 to 2015 in Iran, to assess the progress of the country and its provinces toward these goals. Methods We used three different data sources: three censuses, a Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), and 5-year data from the death registration system. We used the summary birth history data from four data sources (the three censuses and DHS) and used maternal age cohort and maternal age period methods to estimate the trends in child mortality rates, combining the estimates of these two indirect methods using Loess regression. We also used the complete birth history method to estimate child mortality rate directly from DHS data. Finally, to synthesise different trends into a single trend and calculate uncertainty intervals (UI), we used Gaussian process regression. Findings Under-5 mortality rates (deaths per 1000 livebirths) at the national level in Iran in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015 were 63·6 (95% UI 63·1–64·0), 38·8 (38·5–39·2), 24·9 (24·3–25·4), and 19·4 (18·6–20·2), respectively. Between 1990 and 2015, the median annual reduction and total overall reduction in these rates were 4·9% and 70%, respectively. At the provincial level, the difference between the highest and lowest child mortality rates in 1990, 2000, and 2015 were 65·6, 40·4, and 38·1 per 1000 livebirths, respectively. Based on the MDG 4 goal, five provinces had not decreased child mortality by two-thirds by 2015. Furthermore, six provinces had not reached SDG 3 (target 2). Interpretation Iran and most of its provinces achieved MDG 4 and SDG 3 (target 2) goals by 2015. However, at the subnational level in some provinces, there is substantial inequity. Local policy makers should use effective strategies to accelerate the reduction of child mortality for these provinces by 2030. Possible recommendations for such strategies include enhancing the level of education and health literacy among women, tackling sex discrimination, and improving incomes for families.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the use of frozen embryos on the outcome of assisted reproductive technology (ART), a retrospective study of the Japanese Assisted Reproductive Technology Registry data during the years 2007-2012 was conducted. Methods: A total of 124 946 singleton neonates who reached term gestation following ART from 2007-2012, with 80 660 achieved through frozen-thawed embryo transfer (ET) and 44 286 being achieved through fresh ET, were analyzed for their birthweights and chromosomal abnormalities. Results: The birthweight of the neonates from the frozen-thawed ETs was significantly higher than that of those from the fresh ETs throughout all the study years. The frequency of Down syndrome was 0.17% for the fresh ETs and 0.13% for the frozen-thawed ETs in the period 2007-2012. This study showed that frozen-thawed ETs result in a constant increase of the average birthweight between 37 and 41 weeks gestational age and lower frequencies of Down syndrome. Conclusion: Frozen-thawed ETs were comparable to the fresh ET method, with the exceptions of higher birthweights and a lower frequency of Down syndrome in the neonates that were born from frozen-thawed ET. The increase in birthweights was not proportional to the gestational ages. This cannot be explained with any well-known mechanism. The frequency of chromosomal abnormalities needs detailed data for analysis. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Therapeutic fetal surgical procedures are predicated upon the ability to make an accurate fetal diagnosis. The earliest open fetal surgical procedures were introduced in the 1960s to treat Rh isoimmunisation. They were introduced when it became possible to predict impending fetal demise. Open procedures were abandoned when percutaneous approaches proved superior. The introduction of fetal ultrasound allowed the diagnosis of other congenital anomalies, some being amenable to fetal interventions. Open fetal surgical procedures were initially utilised, with significant maternal morbidity. For some anomalies, percutaneous approaches became favoured. In general, all of these procedures involved significant risks to the mother, to save a baby that was likely to die before or shortly after birth without fetal intervention. Fetal repair for myelomeningocele was a “sea change” in approach. The same maternal risks were taken to improve the quality of life of the affected fetus, not save its life. The completion of the “MOMs Trial” has occasioned a “tsunami” of centres in North America applying this approach. Others are attempting percutaneous repairs, with mixed results. This paper reviews the history of fetal surgery, focusing on the themes of the tension between accurate diagnosis and prognosis and open versus “minimally invasive” approaches. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The Pregnancy and Birth Survey was started by Fukushima Medical University as part of the Fukushima Health Management Survey in 2011 in order to assess the physical and mental health of mothers and provide parenting support (telephone counseling) for those in need. The present study reviewed the major findings from 4 annual surveys conducted from 2011 to 2014. Overall proportions of preterm deliveries, low birth weight infants, and congenital anomalies in the first year were almost the same as those in national surveillance data. The prevalence of depressive symptoms among the mothers held steady at about 25% over the 4 years. Regarding the content of parenting counseling, the proportion of mothers who voiced concerns about radiation decreased each year. This survey should be continued to provide support to mothers in Fukushima. © Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore whether earthquake-related maternal Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is associated with impaired development of infants. Participants included 86 women who were pregnant during or after the earthquake in Ningqiang county, and their children. Data were collected from February to March of 2012. PTSD questionnaire (PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version (PCL-C)) was used to measure the effect of the earthquake on mothers, and that the scores greater than 50 were used to indicate presence of PTSD. Each child was assessed using the mental Developmental Screening Test (DST) according to age. Among the 86 women, PTSD scores equal to or greater than 50 accounted for 20.93%. Among the 86 children, 25.60%of development quotient (DQ) scores and 19.80%of mental index (MI) scores were less than 85. The correlation coefficient analysis showed that PTSD scores were inversely related to DQ and MI scores. Maternal PTSD following earthquake exposure is associated with relatively lower intellectual development in children age 0-3 years. Further research is needed to assess the persistent effects of this influence on offspring of mothers exposed to earthquake. © 2017 Cai et al.

AB  - Background: Approaches to estimating and addressing the risk to children from fossil fuel combustion have been fragmented, tending to focus either on the toxic air emissions or on climate change. Yet developing children, and especially poor children, now bear a disproportionate burden of disease from both environmental pollution and climate change due to fossil fuel combustion. Objective: This commentary summarizes the robust scientific evidence regarding the multiple current and projected health impacts of fossil fuel combustion on the young to make the case for a holistic, child-centered energy and climate policy that addresses the full array of physical and psychosocial stressors resulting from fossil fuel pollution. Discussion: The data summarized here show that by sharply reducing our dependence on fossil fuels we would achieve highly significant health and economic benefits for our children and their future. These benefits would occur immediately and also play out over the life course and potentially across generations. Conclusion: Going beyond the powerful scientific and economic arguments for urgent action to reduce the burning of fossil fuels is the strong moral imperative to protect our most vulnerable populations. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

AB  - Forage for grazing and hay may be limited during drought years, necessitating alternative feeding options. Co-product feedstuffs, such as soybean hulls (SH), may be a more economical means to maintain cows through such conditions. The objective of this study was to determine if SH could be used to meet the majority of the energy demands for cows in late gestation when access to hay was restricted to 1 h daily. Eighty-six gestating, spring-calving cows (527 ± 7.5 kg initial BW; 4.3 ± 0.27 yr of age) were allocated to 1 of 6 groups for a 68-d study beginning December 6, 2012. Three groups were given ad libitum access to medium-quality bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] hay. The 3 remaining groups were offered 6.4 kg of SH/cow daily and allowed access to a very-poor-quality, mature, mixed-grass hay for only 1 h daily. Each group was housed in separate 2.02-ha dormant bermudagrass pastures. Birth weight and dystocia scores were recorded, and calf performance was monitored through weaning. Representative bales of each hay were weighed to determine total hay offered. Differences in BW and BCS, and changes in these measurements during the study, were minimal between treatments (P ≥ 0.53). Calf birth weight, weaning weight, BW/d of age at weaning, and birth-to-weaning ADG did not differ (P ≥ 0.11) between treatments. Therefore, SH may be used as the major dietary energy component for cows in late gestation having access to hay for only 1 h daily without having adverse effects on the cows or their subsequent calves. © 2017 American Registry of Professional Animal Scientists

AB  - Emergency medical dispatchers (EMDs) are charged with taking the calls of those who ring the national emergency number for urgent medical assistance, for dispatching paramedical crews, and for providing as much assistance as can be offered remotely until paramedics arrive. In a job role that is filled with vicarious trauma, emergency situations, pressure, abuse, grief, and loss, EMDs are often challenged in maintaining their mental health. The seemingly senseless death of a teenager who commits suicide, the devastating loss of a baby to sudden infant death syndrome, lives lost through natural disasters, and multiple vehicle fatalities are only a few of the types of experiences EMDs are faced with in the course of their work. However, among the horror are positive stories such as coaching a caller to negotiate the birth of a baby and saving a life in jeopardy from heart failure. EMDs need to cope with the daily challenges of the role, make sense of their work, and create meaning to have a fulfilled and sustainable career. Although some people in this work struggle greatly to withstand the impacts of vicarious trauma, there are also stories of personal growth. In this chapter we use a case study to explore how meaning is made for those who are an auditory witness to a continual flux of trauma for others and how the traumatic experiences EMDs bear witness to can also be a catalyst for posttraumatic growth. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Thalidomide is responsible for the biggest medical disaster in history, causing severe birth defects in more than 10,000 children, globally, between 1957 and 1962. Understanding how thalidomide caused birth defects has remained a challenge for many years. Yet thalidomide is now used around the world to successfully treat a wide range of conditions, including leprosy, Crohn’s disease, multiple myeloma, and some cancers. Tragically, however, with its renewed use children are again being born with thalidomide-induced deformities, particularly in Brazil. Breakthroughs in the understanding of thalidomide’s teratogenic actions raise the possibility of producing analogs or synthesizing new forms of thalidomide that maintain the clinical benefits but without the teratogenic side effects. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Pakistan is a developing country and most of its population is based in rural areas. Over the last two decades' significant changes have occurred in the health system in an attempt to improve the health care in general with a particular emphasis in the health of people living in rural areas. Despite these efforts, significant development and planning is required to improve the health of nation. Undoubtedly ministry of health has taken practical steps in tacking some serious health issues such as polio. However, the fact remains that there are a number of public health issues which if not addressed on an urgent basis, there is a great danger that the implications would be huge with unbearable consequences. Among various issues, only those are discussed here which are in a dire need of attention of government, ministry of health, department of public health, disaster management authorities, health education authorities, health institutions and health professionals.

AB  - The American adult population with diabetes is estimated to be 12% while over a third of those aged 20 and above might have prediabetes.1 In China, there are 114 million people with diabetes and 493 million people with prediabetes.2 The diabetes epidemic is also on the rise in India. In 2013, 67 million people in India are confirmed to have diabetes with another 30 million having prediabetes.3 The situation in Saudi Arabia is very serious concerning this country’s looming diabetes disaster. One in four Saudis is very likely to suffer a heart attack, and diabetes is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease.4 The report also revealed that more than 60% of diabetics die of a heart attack. Diabetes also brings other complications such as gestational diabetes, diabetic foot ulcers and heart diseases. In the US alone, the total cost of diagnosed diabetes was about $245 billion in 2013, a substantial burden on society 5. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective The importance of mother’s role in child development and the central role of women in modern society have meant that screening programs for women’s health were developed. The perinatal period is a very fragile phase of a woman’s life, during which there is an increased risk of developing a depressive disorder. This study has the purpose to evaluate the prevalence of perinatal depression, through a screening on pregnant women and in the post partum period, and also to offer them an early therapeutic intervention. Materials and Methods Data were collected in three steps. At first, a screening was performed, in the third trimester of pregnancy, by the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), a self-administered interview for the evaluation of depressive symptoms. All pregnant women received an information brochure on psychiatric disorders that can occur during pregnancy and post partum period. Women who reported a positive test in pregnancy were invited to a clinical interview with a psychiatrist. The second evaluation of depressive symptoms was performed at 40 days after delivery, and the third at 6 months. We also collected data for the most common risk factors associated with perinatal depression. Results 225 pregnant women were enrolled. 70 (31.1%) reported a PHQ score > 5 and 39 of these (17.3%) were diagnosed with depression at the subsequent psychiatric evaluation. 16 depressed pregnant women (7.35%) accepted a pharmacological and/or psycotherapic treatment. 182 women participated in the first follow up, 40 days after delivery, and 8% of them reported some depressive symptom. 167 mothers took part in the second follow up, six months after giving birth and 1.8% of them showed a depressive symptomatology. The presence of depressive symptoms was significantly associated with having suffered from nausea or vomiting (c2 = 4.242 p = 0.039). having had spontaneous abortions in the past (c2 = 4.723 p = 0.030). having taken psychopharmacological treatment in the past (c2 = 5.789 p = 0.016) and living in precarious housing conditions following the L’Aquila 2009 earthquake (c2 = 7.216 p = 0.007). Conclusions This study confirms that perinatal depression is a very common complication of pregnancy. For this reason a special attention from the public services is required, by developing targeted screening programmes. Our data from the post partum period confirm that participating at a screening and prevention programme is associated with a reduction of depressive symptom prevalence and finally with an improving of women health. © 2018 Pacini Editore S.p.A.

AB  - Mobile applications (apps) for self-management of diseases such as diabetes and for general well-being, including keeping track of food, diet, and exercise, are widely available. However, consumers face a flood of new mobile apps in the app stores and have no guidance from clinicians about choosing the appropriate app. As much as clinicians would like to support a patient-centered approach and promote health and wellness mobile apps, they may be unable to provide advice due to the lack of comprehensive and reliable app reviews. This research reviewed a selection of health and wellness mobile apps suitable for the self-management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A prototype of an ecosystem that integrated the data generated by the apps was built and its usefulness and ease of use were evaluated. The results show that the ecosystem can provide support for GDM self-management by sharing health and wellness data across the diabetes clinic. © 2017 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.

AB  - Large-scale catastrophic events and infectious disease outbreaks highlight the need for disaster planning at all community levels. Features unique to the obstetric population (including antepartum, intrapartum, postpartum and neonatal care) warrant special consideration in the event of a disaster. Pregnancy increases the risks of untoward outcomes from various infectious diseases. Trauma during pregnancy presents anatomic and physiologic considerations that often can require increased use of resources such as higher rates of cesarean delivery. Recent evidence suggests that floods and human-influenced environmental disasters increase the risks of spontaneous miscarriages, preterm births, and low-birth-weight infants among pregnant women. The potential surge in maternal and neonatal patient volume due to mass-casualty events, transfer of high-acuity patients, or redirection of patients because of geographic barriers presents unique challenges for obstetric care facilities. These circumstances require that facilities plan for additional increases in necessary resources and staffing. Although emergencies may be unexpected, hospitals and obstetric delivery units can prepare to implement plans that will best serve maternal and pediatric care needs when disasters occur. Clear designation of levels of maternal and neonatal care facilities, along with establishment of a regional network incorporating hospitals that provide maternity services and those that do not, will enable rapid transport of obstetric patients to the appropriate facilities, ensuring the right care at the right time. Using common terminology for triage and transfer and advanced knowledge of regionalization and levels of care will facilitate disaster preparedness. © 2017 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - The Eastern Himalayan region is a unique area with diversifi ed landscapes, a multitude of ethnic groups and a rich variety of fl ora and fauna. It spans not only parts of India’s East and Northeast but also parts of Nepal, all of Bhutan, the Chin and Rakhine states in Myanmar, parts of Yunnan Province in China as well as the Sagaing Region. It is poor in terms of GDP and per capita income with underdeveloped industrialisation and poor infrastructural linkages. It has also witnessed high maternal and infant mortality rates, climate change, natural disasters, political turmoil, armed confl icts which in turn has impacted the livelihoods and well-beings of the population. Women in all poor regions are the worst affected as they face a double vulnerability: fi rst of being women and second of being poor. Limited accessibility to economic resources (do not own land, have no access to credit and are often not gainfully employed) and lack of social opportunities (discriminated in education, health, knowledge and information networks, skill development and social support networks) and political and legal rights (non-participation and exclusion in decision-making processes) expose women to greater risks and vulnerabilities. Cultural constraints, issues of caste, class and ethnicity further combine to create a situation where women face a complex range of challenges which require serious thought and some meaningful but immediate action. Gita Sen comments that ‘gender systems, structures and biases, and forms of oppression and subordination work at multiple levels and are both powerful and resistant to change’ (Sen 2000: 272). Gendered inequality continues to be high and the empowerment of women remains an aspiration. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Sanjoy Hazarika and Reshmi Banerjee; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - The Eastern Himalaya region covers a geographical area that spans five nations and has diverse landscapes, a multitude of ethnic groups and a rich variety of flora and fauna. The region is relatively poor in terms of GDP and per capita income; industrialisation and infrastructure is under-developed; climate-induced disasters are frequent; and maternal and infant mortality rates are high. Economic constraints combined with restrictive cultural norms create barriers for women in education, employment and decision-making, thus further entrenching unequal gender relations. This book explores the ways in which gender-sensitive and inclusive policies can be developed to address the basic issues of marginalisation, livelihood, poverty and vulnerability in the Eastern Himalayas. The chapters in the volume touch upon current concerns, such as the economic and social challenges faced by women, their control over resources, questions of patriarchy, discrimination, conflict, gender rights and equity, information, empowerment and participation, and women as agents of change. This volume will be useful to researchers and scholars in gender studies, sociology and social anthropology, development studies, economic and human geography, politics, northeast and Himalayan studies, South Asian studies, as well as policymakers and those in the development sector and non-governmental organisations. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Sanjoy Hazarika and Reshmi Banerjee; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Pollution is the entry of contaminants into the environment or ecosystem which causes adverse change. The severe cases of radiation contamination lead to changes in DNA leading to genetic mutation, as happened in Hiroshima and Nakzaki in Japan and Chernobyl. Radioactive contamination in Iraq was resulted in the recent wars (1991-2015), because of uranium munitions. It is led to serious environmental and health disasters such as cancer, leukemia, and birth defects. The Iraqi Ministry of Environment has indicated that more than 300 sites in Iraq were polluted by mercury pesticides, heavy metals, polyol, chlorine, and depleted uranium, because of the abandoned weapons in some parts of Iraq from the remnants of the wars that have occurred in the Iraq. © 2017 Menkhi et al.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the effect of earthquakes and terrorist attacks on birth outcomes. These events are unexpected and obvious sources of distress, but could affect fetal health through multiple channels. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System for the period 1969-2004, we estimate the relationship between prenatal exposure to the Super Bowl and low birth weight. Although sporting events can elicit intense emotions, they do not pollute the environment or threaten viewers with direct physical harm. We find that Super Bowl exposure is associated with a small, but precisely estimated, increase in the probability of low birth weight.

AB  - This paper examines nutritional and health challenges facing pastoralists who inhabit fragile rangelands and are one of the most nutritionally vulnerable population groups in Kenya. The review is based on a synthesis of literature on pastoralist food security, nutrition and health status and livelihoods in Kenya's rangelands. Documents reviewed included health and nutrition surveys, journal articles, case studies, reports from Non-Governmental Organisations and 'grey' literature. The main nutritional challenge is food insecurity leading to high malnutrition rates. Global acute malnutrition rates for the last five years ranged from 10 to 28%. Nutritional status of pastoralists varies with seasons, with high malnutrition experienced during droughts, which have been worsened by increasing climate change. Micronutrient deficiencies include iron, folic acid and niacin. Pregnant women consume restricted diets in the belief that they will have easier delivery. This leads to low birth weight, estimated at 13% among some pastoral groups. Knowledge of breastfeeding and complementary feeding is poor. Infants are introduced to animal milk from a few days old, which is a risk factor for malnutrition and morbidity. Besides experiencing chronic under-nutrition, pastoralists carry a substantial disease burden and are poorly covered by health services. The main diseases are malaria, respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea. Availability of safe drinking water is a challenge, and pastoralists are frequently affected by water-borne diseases. Sedentarisation also presents negative nutritional consequences to pastoralists including inadequate housing and lack of clean drinking water. Efforts to address the challenges should focus on nutrition education around the importance of appropriate weight gain during pregnancy, benefits of exclusive breastfeeding, and sanitation concerning safe drinking water. At the community level, there should be an integrated approach by all stakeholders implementing health and nutrition interventions in pastoralist areas. At the national level, interventions should focus both on relief and resilience building, and be tailor-made specifically for the pastoralist communities. The nutritional impact of such interventions needs to be established.

AB  - Human neurodevelopment requires the organization of neural elements into complex structural and functional networks called the connectome. Emerging data suggest that prenatal exposure to maternal stress plays a role in the wiring, or miswiring, of the developing connectome. Stress-related symptoms are common in women during pregnancy and are risk factors for neurobehavioral disorders ranging from autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and addiction, to major depression and schizophrenia. This review focuses on structural and functional connectivity imaging to assess the impact of changes in women's stress-based physiology on the dynamic development of the human connectome in the fetal brain. © 2017 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - In the 30 years since the Chornobyl nuclear power plant disaster, there is evidence of persistent levels of incorporated ionizing radiation in adults, children and pregnant women in the surrounding area. Measured levels of Cesium-137 vary by region, and may be influenced by dietary and water sources as well as proximity to nuclear power plants. Since 2000, comprehensive, population-based birth defects monitoring has been performed in selected regions of Ukraine to evaluate trends and to generate hypotheses regarding potential causes of unexplained variations in defect rates. Significantly higher rates of microcephaly, neural tube defects, and microphthalmia have been identified in selected regions of Ukraine collectively known as Polissia compared to adjacent regions collectively termed non-Polissia, and these significantly higher rates were evident particularly in the years 2000–2009. The Polissia regions have also demonstrated higher mean whole body counts of Cesium-137 compared to values in individuals residing in other non-Polissia regions. The potential causal relationship between persistent ionizing radiation pollution and selected congenital anomaly rates supports the need for a more thorough, targeted investigation of the sources of persistent ionizing radiation and the biological plausibility of a potential teratogenic effect. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Objective In a prospective study on the degree of association between prenatal maternal exposure to a devastating earthquake and the development of autistic behaviors in children three years after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the singular evolution of a one of the dyads encountered drew our attention for in-depth qualitative analysis. Method The work was conducted in three steps. (1) Evaluation (August and December 2013) of 364 mother–child dyads in the west and south regions of Haiti devastated by the disaster, using the PTSD-specific Checklist and the Evaluation Scale for Autistic Behaviors; (2) a second evaluation of a small group of children identified those at risk for autistic characteristics; (3) selection of one dyad from the epicenter, Léogâne, and administration of a semi-structured interview with the family, while the child was observed in her natural environment for completion of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). Results Data obtained from the CARS corresponded to a diagnosis of severe autistic disorder. In addition, this autistic profile was accompanied by recurrent seizures, which began in the neonatal period. Discussion Genetic links have been established between epilepsy and autism, however the possible transmission of traumatic experiences from mother to offspring during gestation should not be neglected. Conclusion Despite the poor prognosis reported for the outcome of autistic and epileptic patients, the hypothesis of a positive evolution for this girl appears plausible by providing medical, psychosocial and educational care, with a focus on the effects of parental transmission of trauma. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Incidences of natural disasters have been prevalent in present times, generating increased interest in the impact and required response to these tragic phenomena. Recent events include those in the United States and the Caribbean Islands (Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, Maria, Irma, and Superstorm Sandy), Haiti (the earthquake in 2010 and Hurricane Matthew in 2016), and Asia and Japan (the tsunamis of 2004 and 2011). All of these have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and caused millions of dollars in damage and destruction to business, livelihood, infrastructure, and social cohesion. Epidemics have also plagued the world population. The Ebola epidemic, hitting hardest in West African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea, but also with some scattered cases in the Western world, caused over 11, 000 deaths with over 28, 000 cases (WHO, 2016a). With regard to the devastating outbreak of the Zika virus, causing birth defects, 61 countries and territories have reported continuing mosquito-borne transmission (WHO, 2016b) © 2018 by Lexington Books All rights reserved

AB  - In the lecture we have generalized and analyzed the data of cytogenetic laboratory of National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine on 30-year selective cytogenetic monitoring among the priority contingents of different ages exposed to radiation after Chornobyl accident in Ukraine. It is highlighted that not only targeted but also untargeted radiation-induced cytogenetic effects should be explored, especially in delayed terms following radiation exposure. The new methodical approaches for studying "bystander effect", individual radiosensitivity, and various forms of radiation-induced chromosomal instability (delayed, hidden, transmissible) have been proposed. These approaches proved to be advantageous for analyzing cytogenetic patterns of induction and persistence of chromosomal instability in human somatic cells because of "bystander effect" and "bystander type effect". The phenomenon of positive "reverse" bystander effect has been found. The possibility of modifying the inherited individual human susceptibility to mutagenic exposure by ionizing radiation has been estimated. Finally, the association between hypersensitivity to radiation exposure and realization of oncopathology in exposed individuals has been revealed. The increased intensity of human somatic chromosomal mutagenesis was confirmed not only in the nearest but in the delayed terms following Chornobyl accident as a result of radiation-induced both targeted and untargeted cytogenetic effects. Such effects can be considered as risk factors for malignant transformation of cells, hereditary diseases, birth defects, and multifactorial somatic pathology. This article is a part of a Special Issue entitled "The Chornobyl Nuclear Accident: Thirty Years After".

AB  - South Africa is a young democracy currently going through a crisis of leadership. The worst drought in recorded history has played out at regional level but against the backdrop of complex political dynamics. The government has lost significant capacity at the technical level, largely the result of political priorities driven by the need to decolonise society and the institutions of higher learning. This has manifest in the water sector as systemic failures of key instrumentation systems, rendering the El Niño event invisible until it hit. This case study of the El Niño event shows that drought management is embedded within a broader political process and is not simply a technical management issue. The Vaal River system sustains 60% of the national economy and 45% of the total population of the country, but water security in this system has been placed at risk because of political dynamics. © 2016 IWA Publishing.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the association between medical institution change for perinatal care and gestational duration after the Great East Japan Earthquake using data from the Fukushima Health Management Survey. Methods: The data of pregnant women who experienced the earthquake in Fukushima prefecture and participated in the Pregnancy and Birth Survey as part of the Fukushima Health Management Survey were analyzed. The primary and secondary outcomes of this study were gestational duration and preterm birth, respectively. The main study factor was prenatal checkup institution (only one institution, changed institution due to self-referral, changed institution due to medical indication, and went to parents' home for childbirth). Self-referral was considered as indicative of relocation after the disaster. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of earthquake on each outcome. Results: A total of 5593 (60.2%) participants experienced the earthquake between the 4th and 37th weeks of their gestational period. After controlling for variables, pregnant women who changed their perinatal checkup institution due to medical indication were significantly associated with shorter gestational duration (β = −10.6, P < 0.001) and preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio, 8.5; 95% confidence interval, 5.8–12.5) compared with women who visited only one institution. Self-referral, however, was not significantly associated with the outcomes. Conclusion: According to prenatal checkup status, our results suggest that the effect on gestational duration of the Great East Japan Earthquake and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was not significant. © 2016 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology

AB  - Objective Hurricanes are powerful tropical storm systems with high winds which influence many health effects. Few studies have examined whether hurricane exposure is associated with preterm delivery. We aimed to estimate associations between maternal hurricane exposure and hazard of preterm delivery. Methods We used data on 342,942 singleton births from Florida Vital Statistics Records 2004–2005 to capture pregnancies at risk of delivery during the 2004 hurricane season. Maternal exposure to Hurricane Charley was assigned based on maximum wind speed in maternal county of residence. We estimated hazards of overall preterm delivery (<37 gestational weeks) and extremely preterm delivery (<32 gestational weeks) in Cox regression models, adjusting for maternal/pregnancy characteristics. To evaluate heterogeneity among racial/ethnic subgroups, we performed analyses stratified by race/ethnicity. Additional models investigated whether exposure to multiples hurricanes increased hazard relative to exposure to one hurricane. Results Exposure to wind speeds ≥39 mph from Hurricane Charley was associated with a 9 % (95 % CI 3, 16 %) increase in hazard of extremely preterm delivery, while exposure to wind speed ≥74 mph was associated with a 21 % (95 % CI 6, 38 %) increase. Associations appeared greater for Hispanic mothers compared to non-Hispanic white mothers. Hurricane exposure did not appear to be associated with hazard of overall preterm delivery. Exposure to multiple hurricanes did not appear more harmful than exposure to a single hurricane. Conclusions Hurricane exposure may increase hazard of extremely preterm delivery. As US coastal populations and hurricane severity increase, the associations between hurricane and preterm delivery should be further studied. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background: The ashes and dust resulting from the 2011 eruptions of the Puyehue volcano in Chile more than doubled monthly averages of PM<inf>10</inf> concentrations in Montevideo, Uruguay. Few studies have taken advantage of natural experiments to assess the relationship between ambient air pollutant concentrations and birth outcomes. Objectives: In this study we explored the effect of particulate matter with diameter of ≤ 10 μm (PM<inf>10</inf>) on perinatal outcomes in Uruguay, a middle-income country in South America with levels of PM<inf>10</inf> that in general do not exceed the recommended thresholds. The analyzed outcomes are preterm birth, term birth weight, and term low birth weight. Methods: We took advantage of the sharp variation in PM<inf>10</inf> concentrations due to the Puyehue eruptions to estimate the associations between mother’s exposure to PM<inf>10</inf> in each trimester of pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. We use birth registries for 2010-2013 and control for covariates, including maternal and pregnancy characteristics, weather, co-pollutants, and calendar quarter and hospital indicators. Results: A 10-μg/m3 increase in exposure to PM<inf>10</inf> during the third trimester was associated with a higher likelihood of a preterm birth [odds ratio (OR) = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.19]. The association was robust to different model specifications, and increased with categorical exposure levels (OR for third-trimester PM<inf>10</inf> ≥ 70 vs. < 30 μg/m3 = 5.24; 95% CI: 3.40, 8.08). Exposures were not consistently associated with birth weight or low birth weight among term births, though second-trimester exposures were associated with higher birth weight, contrary to expectations. Conclusions: Taking advantage of a natural experiment, we found evidence that exposure to high levels of PM<inf>10</inf> during the third trimester of pregnancy may have increased preterm births among women in Montevideo, Uruguay. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

AB  - Objective: To assess the impact of experiencing a major flood during pregnancy on fetal growth and length of gestation, and to consider how flood-related strains might contribute to these effects. Method: The Red River Pregnancy Project was a prospective study carried out for 3 months immediately after the historic 2009 crest of the Red River in Fargo, North Dakota. Pregnant community residents who were at least 18 years old with a singleton, intrauterine pregnancy participated in the study (N = 169). Analyses examined if birth weight and length of gestation were associated with residential distance from flooding and gestational age at time of the flood crest. Results: For pregnancies earlier in gestation during the crest (-1 SD = 12 weeks), birth weight decreased as distance from flooding decreased (-42.29 g/mi, p < .01). For pregnancies later in gestation at crest (+1 SD = 26 weeks), distance was not associated with birth weight (p > .10). Biparietal growth trajectories showed a decrease in growth after the crest of the flood but only for women early in pregnancy. However, various measures of flood related and general stress or strain did not explain these effects. Length of gestation was not associated with distance from or the timing of the flood. Conclusions: Pregnant women in the first trimester who experience a major flood near their homes are at risk of having lower birth weight neonates due to a reduction in fetal growth. The mechanisms of this effect deserve further attention in rapidly mounted investigations after disaster. © 2016 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Background Healthy life expectancy (HALE) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) provide summary measures of health across geographies and time that can inform assessments of epidemiological patterns and health system performance, help to prioritise investments in research and development, and monitor progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We aimed to provide updated HALE and DALYs for geographies worldwide and evaluate how disease burden changes with development. Methods We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost (YLLs) and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) for each geography, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using the Sullivan method, which draws from age-specific death rates and YLDs per capita. We then assessed how observed levels of DALYs and HALE differed from expected trends calculated with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator constructed from measures of income per capita, average years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Findings Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2015, with decreases in communicable, neonatal, maternal, and nutritional (Group 1) disease DALYs offset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Much of this epidemiological transition was caused by changes in population growth and ageing, but it was accelerated by widespread improvements in SDI that also correlated strongly with the increasing importance of NCDs. Both total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most Group 1 causes significantly decreased by 2015, and although total burden climbed for the majority of NCDs, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined. Nonetheless, age-standardised DALY rates due to several high-burden NCDs (including osteoarthritis, drug use disorders, depression, diabetes, congenital birth defects, and skin, oral, and sense organ diseases) either increased or remained unchanged, leading to increases in their relative ranking in many geographies. From 2005 to 2015, HALE at birth increased by an average of 2·9 years (95% uncertainty interval 2·9–3·0) for men and 3·5 years (3·4–3·7) for women, while HALE at age 65 years improved by 0·85 years (0·78–0·92) and 1·2 years (1·1–1·3), respectively. Rising SDI was associated with consistently higher HALE and a somewhat smaller proportion of life spent with functional health loss; however, rising SDI was related to increases in total disability. Many countries and territories in central America and eastern sub-Saharan Africa had increasingly lower rates of disease burden than expected given their SDI. At the same time, a subset of geographies recorded a growing gap between observed and expected levels of DALYs, a trend driven mainly by rising burden due to war, interpersonal violence, and various NCDs. Interpretation Health is improving globally, but this means more populations are spending more time with functional health loss, an absolute expansion of morbidity. The proportion of life spent in ill health decreases somewhat with increasing SDI, a relative compression of morbidity, which supports continued efforts to elevate personal income, improve education, and limit fertility. Our analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework on which to benchmark geography-specific health performance and SDG progress. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform financial and research investments, prevention efforts, health policies, and health system improvement initiatives for all countries along the development continuum.

AB  - Aim: National medical projects are carried out according to medical care plans directed by the Medical Care Act of Japan. In order to improve Japanese perinatal medical care, it is necessary to determine the factors that might influence perinatal outcome. Methods: Statistical data of births and perinatal deaths were obtained for all municipalities in Japan from 2008 to 2012 from the Portal Site of Official Statistics of Japan (e-Stat). The perinatal mortality of all 349 Japanese secondary medical care zones was calculated. The number of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), maternal-fetal intensive care units (MFICUs), pediatricians and obstetricians in 2011 were also obtained from e-Stat. Nine secondary medical care zones in two prefectures, Fukushima (7) and Miyagi (2) were excluded to eliminate the influence of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Results: The 340 secondary medical care zones were divided into three groups according to population size and density: metropolis, provincial city, and depopulation. The number of secondary medical care zones in each group were 52, 168, and 120, respectively. The secondary medical care zones in the depopulation group had fewer pediatricians and significantly fewer NICUs and MFICUs than the metropolis group, but there was no significant difference in perinatal mortality. The only independent risk factor for high perinatal mortality, determined by multivariable analysis, was the absence of an NICU (P = 0.011). Conclusions: To consider directions in perinatal medical care, planned arrangement and appropriate access to NICUs is indispensable. © 2016 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology

AB  - Objectives. To estimate associations between exposure to the events of September 11, 2001, (9/11) and low birth weight (LBW), preterm delivery (PD), and small size for gestational age (SGA). Methods. We matched birth certificates filed in New York City for singleton births between 9/11 and the end of 2010 to 9/11-related exposure data provided by mothers who were World Trade Center Health Registry enrollees. Generalized estimating equations estimated associations between exposures and LBW, PD, and SGA. Results. Among 3360 births, 5.8% were LBW, 6.5% were PD, and 9% were SGA. Having incurred at least 2 of 4 exposures, having performed rescue or recovery work, and probable 9/11-related posttraumatic stress disorder 2 to 3 years after 9/11 were associated with PD and LBW during the early study period. Conclusions. Disasters on the magnitude of 9/11 may exert effects on reproductive outcomes for several years. Women who are pregnant during and after a disaster should be closely monitored for physical and psychological sequelae. Public Health Implications. In utero and maternal disaster exposure may affect birth outcomes. Researchers studying effects of individual disasters should identify commonalities that may inform postdisaster responses to minimize disaster-related adverse birth outcomes.

AB  - In January 2016, the World Health Organization warned that Zika virus is spreading explosively in the Americas and that up to 4 million infections could be present worldwide within a year. Soon thereafter, some politicians and authors publicly advocated for quarantine of travelers returning from regions where mosquitoes carrying Zika virus are prevalent. The public health tool of quarantine can be used to prevent the spread of infection by restricting the movement of persons who have been exposed to a deadly disease that can be transmitted from person to person before symptom onset. With 80% of Zika virus infections being asymptomatic, no rapid test being available to detect the virus, and primary transmission being via the bites of certain mosquitoes, application of quarantine in this setting is not scientifically sound or practically feasible. Rather, public health interventions should focus on preventing bites from infected mosquitoes, counseling pregnant women on the risks of fetal microcephaly and other birth defects, and identifying patients with signs and symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome. As was seen in the Ebola virus disease outbreak of 2014, non-evidence-based factors can influence policy decisions. Public health experts must ensure that policy makers are informed that quarantine is not a scientifically sound approach for the control of Zika virus.

AB  - Background: Mozambique has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. The main influences on maternal health encompass social, economic, political, environmental and cultural determinants of health. To effectively address maternal mortality in the post-2015 agenda, interventions need to consider the determinants of health so that their delivery is not limited to the health sector. The objective of this exploratory qualitative study was to identify key community groups' perspectives on the perceived determinants of maternal health in rural areas of southern Mozambique. Methods: Eleven focus group discussions were conducted with women of reproductive age, pregnant women, matrons, male partners, community leaders and health workers. Participants were recruited using sampling techniques of convenience and snow balling. Focus groups had an average of nine participants each. The heads of 12 administrative posts were also interviewed to understand the local context. Data were coded and analysed thematically using NVivo software. Results: A broad range of political, economic, socio-cultural and environmental determinants of maternal health were identified by community representatives. It was perceived that the civil war has resulted in local unemployment and poverty that had a number of downstream effects including lack of funds for accessing medical care and transport, and influence on socio-cultural determinants, particularly gender relations that disadvantaged women. Socio-cultural determinants included intimate partner violence toward women, and strained relationships with in-laws and co-spouses. Social relationships were complex as there were both negative and positive impacts on maternal health. Environmental determinants included natural disasters and poor access to roads and transport exacerbated by the wet season and subsequent flooding. Conclusions: In rural southern Mozambique, community perceptions of the determinants of maternal health included political, economic, socio-cultural and environmental factors. These determinants were closely linked with one another and highlight the importance of including the local history, context, culture and geography in the design of maternal health programs. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Ignoring reproductive health services during natural disasters leads to some negative consequences such as reduced access to contraceptive methods, sexual disorders, and pregnancy complications. Despite previous researches, there is still more need for research on this area of health. This study attempts to identify the indicators of reproductive health in the women affected by the East Azarbaijan earthquake on August 2012. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, reproductive health information pertaining to the years before, during, and after the earthquake were collected and compared in the health centers of the three affected cities including Ahar, Heriss, and Varzaghan as well as the health and forensics centers of the East Azarbaijan province in Iran by census method. Results: Findings indicated a decrease in live birth rate, general marriage fertility rate, stillbirth rate, contraceptive methods coverage, and prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases during and after the earthquake. Moreover, important indicators such as neonatal mortality rate and percentage of infants screened for breast milk, decreased during the disaster year in comparison with the years before and after. Other indicators such as preconception care, pregnancy first visit, rate of caesarian delivery, and under 1-year formula milk-fed infants' percentages increased during the year of disaster in comparison with the years before and after. Conclusions: During the earthquake, some indicators of reproductive health have been reported to decrease whereas some others have gone through negative changes. Despite the partly favorable status of services, decision-makers and health service providers should pay more attention to the needs of women during disasters. © 2016 Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - The devastating 25 April, 2015 earthquake in Nepal has affected a total of 1.4 million women and girls of reproductive age in the 14 most affected districts in which 93,000 were pregnant at the time of the earthquake, with 10,000 delivering each month requiring emergency obstetric care and 1,000 to 1,500 at risk of pregnancy related complications necessitating cesarean sections. Malnutrition and poverty hit women the hardest due to their longer working hours at work and home with limited access of education, health care, and involvement in local and state government. The midwifery society of Nepal (MIDSON) has established Help Desk for a week in national maternity hospital and served 100 women with the various problems of miscarriage, less fetal movement, bloody discharge, false labor pain, transportation problem to back home etc. Latter on MIDSON has expanded with support of UNFPA to conduct mobile RH camps with Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) to protect women and girls in Nuwakot district. 25 nurse midwives were deployed in six affected districts for 3 months with support of UNICEF.

AB  - Background: Wildfire activity is predicted to increase in many parts of the world due to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns from global climate change. Wildfire smoke contains numerous hazardous air pollutants and many studies have documented population health effects from this exposure. Objectives: We aimed to assess the evidence of health effects from exposure to wildfire smoke and to identify susceptible populations. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature for studies of wildfire smoke exposure on mortality and on respiratory, cardiovascular, mental, and perinatal health. Within those reviewed papers deemed to have minimal risk of bias, we assessed the coherence and consistency of findings. Discussion: Consistent evidence documents associations between wildfire smoke exposure and general respiratory health effects, specifically exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Growing evidence suggests associations with increased risk of respiratory infections and all-cause mortality. Evidence for cardiovascular effects is mixed, but a few recent studies have reported associations for specific cardiovascular end points. Insufficient research exists to identify specific population subgroups that are more susceptible to wildfire smoke exposure. Conclusions: Consistent evidence from a large number of studies indicates that wildfire smoke exposure is associated with respiratory morbidity with growing evidence supporting an association with all-cause mortality. More research is needed to clarify which causes of mortality may be associated with wildfire smoke, whether cardiovascular outcomes are associated with wildfire smoke, and if certain populations are more susceptible. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

AB  - Background: Development of virtual reality simulations requires an interprofessional team, but effective communication is inhibited by a lack of structured methods for sharing information. A review of the literature found a paucity of tools available for virtual reality storyboard development. This paper's purpose is to provide an overview of the storyboard process developed by an interprofessional team of researchers studying Neonatal Intensive Care evacuation. Method: Using Standards of Best Practices in Simulation and Jeffries model as framework, the researchers developed processes and templates for storyboarding. Results: The outcomes provide a vehicle for simulation development based upon best practices. Conclusions: The storyboard format that includes objectives, scenes, actions, challenges, redirection and opportunity to debrief, enabled the interprofessional team to build a virtual simulation that is reflective of best practices and the Neonatal Intensive Care evacuation scenario. © 2016 International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning.

AB  - Coastal areas in Southeast Asia are experiencing high sodium concentrations in drinking water sources that are commonly consumed by local populations. Salinity problems caused by episodic cyclones and subsequent seawater inundations are likely (partly) related to climate change and further exacerbated by changes in upstream river flow and local land-use activities. Dietary (food) sodium plays an important role in the global burden of hypertensive disease. It remains unknown, however, if sodium in drinking water - rather than food - has similar effects on blood pressure and disease risk. In this study, we examined the effect of drinking water sodium on blood pressure of pregnant women: increases in blood pressure in this group could severely affect maternal and fetal health. Data on blood pressure, drinking water source, and personal, lifestyle, and environmental confounders was obtained from 701 normotensive pregnant women residing in coastal Bangladesh. Generalized linear mixed regression models were used to investigate association of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of these - otherwise healthy - women with their water source. After adjustment for confounders, drinkers of tube well and pond water (high saline sources) were found to have significantly higher average systolic (+4.85 and +3.62 mm Hg) and diastolic (+2.30 and +1.72 mm Hg) blood pressures than rainwater drinkers. Drinking water salinity problems are expected to exacerbate in the future, putting millions of coastal people - including pregnant women - at increased risk of hypertension and associated diseases. There is an urgent need to further explore the health risks associated to this understudied environmental health problem and feasibility of possible adaptation strategies. © 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - Objective Mongolia experienced one of its most severe natural winter disasters (dzud) in 2009-2010. It is difficult to accurately assess the risk of the effects of dzud on human lives and public health. This study aimed to evaluate the Mongolian public health risks of dzud by assessing livestock loss. Methods We analyzed data from all 21 provinces and Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia and compared the changes in infant mortality (2009-2010) and the decline in the numbers of livestock (percentage change from the previous year), which included horses, cattle, camels, sheep, and goats (2009-2010) and/or meteorological data. We also evaluated the association among the trends in the infant mortality rate, the number of livestock, and foodstuff consumption throughout Mongolia (2001-2012). Results The change in the infant mortality rate was positively correlated with the rate of decreasing numbers of each type of livestock in 2010. Average temperature and total precipitation were not related to the change in the infant mortality rate. In the trend from 2001 to 2012, there was a significant positive correlation between the infant mortality rate and the number of livestock and the consumption of milk products. Conclusions Loss of livestock and shortage of milk products leading to malnutrition might have affected public health as typified by infant mortality in Mongolia.

AB  - Background: The Haiti earthquake in 2010 resulted in 1.5 million internally displaced people (IDP), yet little is known about the impact of displacement on health. In this study, we estimate the impact of displacement on infant and child mortality and key health-behavior mechanisms. Methods: We employ a difference-in-differences (DID) design with coarsened exact matching (CEM) to ensure comparability among groups with different displacement status using the 2012 Haiti Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The participants are 21,417 births reported by a nationally representative sample of 14,287 women aged 15-49. The main independent variables are household displacement status which includes households living in camps, IDP households (not in camps), and households not displaced. The main outcomes are infant and child mortality; health status (height-for-age, anemia); uptake of public health interventions (bed net use, spraying against mosquitoes, and vaccinations); and other conditions (hunger; cholera). Results: Births from the camp households have higher infant mortality (OR = 2.34, 95 % CI 1.15 to 4.75) and child mortality (OR = 2.34, 95 % CI 1.10 to 5.00) than those in non-camp IDP households following the earthquake. These odds are higher despite better access to food, water, bed net use, mosquito spraying, and vaccines among camp households. Conclusions: IDP populations are heterogeneous and households that are displaced outside of camps may be self-selected or self-insured. Meanwhile, even households not displaced by a disaster may face challenges in access to basic necessities and health services. Efforts are needed to identify vulnerable populations to provide targeted assistance in post-disaster relief. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Epigenetics plays a role in many disorders that are present in the pediatric populations (eg, in early human development, including-embryologic and fetal life, infancy, childhood, and adolescence). Many syndromes were described because of their characteristic clinical features before epigenetic mechanisms were understood. Because time in development (age), as well as tissue specific and gender specific gene expression are so important in early development, it is not surprising that disturbances in control of gene expression will lead to pathologic conditions. These groups of disorders are important in pediatrics, and, thus, to the pediatrician.Mammalian flexibility in response to environmental change is now recognized to play a role in transgenerational programming for many chronic diseases of adults that appear to have their genesis in very early life. Working out the pathways and mechanisms for these disorders holds the promise for therapy in the future. Small for dates (IUGR) newborns should avoid excess weight gain during infancy and early childhood as this may help prevent some chronic diseases. Recording data on the placenta at birth is likely to be important for future research and possibly therapy. A new type of family history including multigenerational information on birth weights, environmental exposures, pregnancy histories, and exposure to various types of stress will be important for future medical care. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: To assess the risk for preterm deliveries <37 week of gestation and associated prevalence of vaginal infection in a rural setting after the tsunami in Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Methods: Wet mount microscopy, vaginal pH and vaginal swabs for microbiological culture were collected in pregnant women during the 2nd trimester from February to June of 2005 in four temporary outpatient clinics and the patients were followed up until delivery. Results: One hundred and fifty-nine pregnant patients were screened. Sixty-two could be followed up until delivery. Thirty-nine (62.9%) delivered at term and 23 (37.1%) delivered prematurely. Significant risk factors for preterm delivery were a history of preterm delivery and group B streptococcus infection. Increased vaginal pH alone had no significant influence on preterm delivery, although there was a trend. Conclusion: The rate of preterm delivery was high in this cohort. We suggest risk stratification for preterm delivery in rural conditions by performing a vaginal pH and wet mount microscopy. If either is suspect we suggest collecting a vaginal swab for microbiological culture for targeted treatment. Patients with a history of preterm delivery are at increased risk and should be monitored closely. © 2016 by De Gruyter 2016.

AB  - The current study examined the effects of a natural disaster (a sudden onset flood) as a stressor in pregnancy on infant fine and gross motor development at 2, 6, and 16 months of age. Whether the timing of the stressor in pregnancy or sex of the infant moderated the impact of the prenatal maternal stress on motor development was also explored. Mothers' objective experiences of the flood, emotional reactions and distress, and their cognitive appraisal of the event were assessed retrospectively. Infants' fine and gross motor skills were assessed with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, and results showed age-related changes in the effects of prenatal maternal stress on these domains. At 2 months, higher levels of prenatal maternal stress was positively related to infant motor development, yet at 6 and 16 months of age there was a negative association, particularly if flood exposure occurred later in pregnancy and if mothers had negative cognitive appraisals of the event. Results also showed differential effects of the maternal stress responses to the floods on infants' fine and gross motor development at each age and that infant sex did not buffer these effects. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: The evidence concerning safety of occupational exposure to ionizing radiation on teratogenic effects mainly relies on animal models, disaster epidemiology and experience in cancer etiology. Following an explorative result on maternal exposure in medical occupations we conducted a feasibility study, addressing congenital anomalies (CA) in the offspring of health workers potentially exposed to radiation. Methods: In a prospective follow-up study, we enrolled women, identified by mandatory registration at the office of radiation protection as wearing a dosimeter. The participating women answered a questionnaire and if pregnant agreed to an examination of their infant. CA were diagnosed and categorized, and demographic and anamnestic findings (including dosimeter values) were ascertained. Mainz Birth Registry data were used for comparison, and a nonresponder analysis was performed. Results: Answers were received from 286 of 604 (51%) women exposed and 183 (30.3%) of them participated in the study including 88 nonparticipants who provided exposure data only. Further sources of ionizing radiation and other factors relevant for CA did not differ between the groups. Thirty pregnancies occurred among the participants. Eight of the resulting 27 infants were diagnosed with CA (30%) compared with 6.2% of the comparison group. Conclusion: Previous explorative findings were corroborated by this feasibility study. The increased prevalence for CA could not be explained by any other factor. A preferable prospective active design is achievable, and the participation rate is essential to calculate valid results and answer this important issue.

AB  - Objectives The authors report the results of surveys on the emergency transport or evacuation status of obstetric patients conducted in Miyagi prefecture, one of the major disaster areas of the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami. Methods The surveys examined the damages to maternity institutions, evacuation status and transport of pregnant women, and prehospital childbirths and were conducted in 50 maternity institutions and 12 fire departments in Miyagi. Results Two coastal institutions were destroyed completely, and four institutions were destroyed partially by the tsunami, forcing them to stop medical services. In the two-month period after the disaster, 217 pregnant women received hospital transport or gave birth after evacuation. Satisfactory perinatal outcomes were maintained. Emergency obstetric transport increased to approximately 1.4 fold the number before the disaster. Twenty-three women had prehospital childbirths, indicating a marked increase to approximately three times the number of the previous year. Conclusion In the acute phase of the tsunami disaster, maternity institutions were damaged severely and perinatal transport was not possible; as a result, pregnant women inevitably gave birth in unplanned institutions, and the number of prehospital births was increased extremely. To obtain satisfactory obstetric outcomes, it is necessary to construct a future disaster management system and to re-recognize pregnant women as people with special needs in disaster situations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hospitals conduct evacuation exercises to improve performance during emergency events. An essential aspect in this process is the creation of reliable and valid evaluation tools. The objective of this article is to describe the development and implications of a disaster evacuation performance tool that measures one portion of the very complex process of evacuation.DESIGN: Through the application of the Delphi technique and DeVellis's framework, disaster and neonatal experts provided input in developing this performance evaluation tool. Following development, content validity and reliability of this tool were assessed.SETTING: Large pediatric hospital and medical center in the Midwest.PARTICIPANTS: The tool was pilot tested with an administrative, medical, and nursing leadership group and then implemented with a group of 68 healthcare workers during a disaster exercise of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).RESULTS: The tool has demonstrated high content validity with a scale validity index of 0.979 and inter-rater reliability G coefficient (0.984, 95% CI: 0.948-0.9952).CONCLUSIONS: The Delphi process based on the conceptual framework of DeVellis yielded a psychometrically sound evacuation performance evaluation tool for a NICU.

AB  - Background: Investigations soon after the 1986 Chornobyl (Chernobyl in Russian) accident of exposed populations residing elsewhere in Europe led government and international agencies to conclude that exposures to cesium-137 (Cs-137) were not teratogenic. Our observations of elevated population rates of neural tube defects (NTDs) and microcephaly and microphthalmia (M/M) in the Rivne Province in Ukraine, which were among the highest in Europe, prompted this follow-up investigation inclusive of whole-body counts (WBCs) of Cs-137 among ambulatory patients and pregnant women residing in Polissia, the most polluted region in Rivne. Methods: Yearly (2000-2012) population rates of NTDs and M/M and WBC patterns of ambulatory patients (2001-2010) and pregnant women (2011-2013) in Polissia and non-Polissia regions of Rivne were analyzed. Results: The NTD and M/M population rates in Rivne remain elevated and are statistically significantly higher in Polissia than in non-Polissia. The WBCs among residents in Polissia are statistically significantly higher than among those from non-Polissia. Conclusion: NTD and M/M rates are highest in the Polissia region of Rivne and are among the highest in Europe. In Polissia, the WBCs of Cs-137 are above officially set permissible upper limits. The results are based on aggregate data of NTDs and M/Ms and average WBC values. Further investigations of causality of the high rates of NTDs and M/Ms are needed and urgent strengthening policies and implementations to reduce exposures to teratogens, in particular radioactive nuclides and alcohol, and consumption of folic acid supplements are indicated. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Hydraulic fracturing technologies, developed over the last 65 years, have only recently been combined with horizontal drilling to unlock oil and gas reserves previously deemed inaccessible. Although these technologies have dramatically increased domestic oil and natural gas production, they have also raised concerns for the potential contamination of local water supplies with the approximately 1,000 chemicals that are used throughout the process, including many known or suspected endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Objectives: We discuss the need for an endocrine component to health assessments for drillingdense regions in the context of hormonal and antihormonal activities for chemicals used. Methods: We discuss the literature on a) surface and groundwater contamination by oil and gas extraction operations, and b) potential human exposure, particularly in the context of the total hormonal and antihormonal activities present in surface and groundwater from natural and anthropogenic sources; we also discuss initial analytical results and critical knowledge gaps. Discussion: In light of the potential for environmental release of oil and gas chemicals that can disrupt hormone receptor systems, we recommend methods for assessing complex hormonally active environmental mixtures. Conclusions: We describe a need for an endocrine-centric component for overall health assessments and provide information supporting the idea that using such a component will help explain reported adverse health trends as well as help develop recommendations for environmental impact assessments and monitoring programs. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

AB  - Objective We aimed to examine the relationship between exposure to the 2010 Haiti earthquake and pregnancy wantedness, interpregnancy interval, and birth weight. Methods From the nationally representative Haiti 2012 Demographic and Health Survey, information on size of child at birth (too small or not) was available for 7280 singleton births in the previous 5 years, whereas information on birth weight was available for 1607 births. Pregnancy wantedness, short (<1 year) interpregnancy interval, and maternal-reported birth weight were compared before and after the earthquake and by level of damage. Multiple logistic regression and linear regression analyses were conducted. Results Post-earthquake births were less likely to be wanted and more likely to be born after a short interpregnancy interval. Earthquake exposure was associated with increased likelihood of a child being born too small: timing of birth (after earthquake vs. before earthquake, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-1.45), region (hardest-hit vs. rest of country; aOR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.14- 1.80), and house damage (aOR: 1.27 95% CI: 1.02-1.58). Mean birth weight was 150 to 300 g lower in those exposed to the earthquake. Conclusions Experience with the earthquake was associated with worse reproductive and birth outcomes, which underscores the need to provide reproductive health services as part of relief efforts. © © Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc. 2015.

AB  - Increasing coastal populations and storm intensity may lead to more adverse health effects from tropical storms and hurricanes. Exposure during pregnancy can influence birth outcomes through mechanisms related to healthcare, infrastructure disruption, stress, nutrition, and injury. However, accurate estimation of health effects may be limited by nonspecific exposure definitions that create potential misclassification. The two predominant hurricane exposure assignments are (1) the county of a FEMA presidential disaster declaration; and (2) the specified area within a storm track. The authors propose a third method: meteorological severity of wind speed. Based on the Saffir-Simpson categories, wind speed was examined through binary and quartile comparisons. All three methods of exposure classification were compared by examining the associations with county-level preterm birth and low-birth-weight rates among Florida women who were pregnant during the 2004 hurricane season. The county-level environmental quality index developed by the EPA was used to control for county-level environmental factors. Although the models yielded unexpected negative results and insignificant rate differences, a descriptive and mapping analysis of the exposure methods showed clear heterogeneity of county exposure. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Objective To examine psychological distress among pregnant women in Miyagi prefecture which was directly affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami and compare other areas of Japan that were less damaged. Methods This study was conducted in conjunction with the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS). We examined 10,129 Japanese women using the primary fixed data of the JECS. The Kessler 6-item psychological distress scale (K6) was administered to 7473 eligible women including 998 in Miyagi unit center ('Miyagi UC') and 6475 in the other unit centers ('13UCs'). We compared the prevalence and the risk of distress (K6 ≥13) during pregnancy in 'Miyagi UC' and '13UCs'. Results More women in 'Miyagi UC' (4.9%) suffered psychological distress, compared with '13UCs' (3.1%) (p<0.001). A significantly higher prevalence of women in 'Miyagi UC' (55.5%) had experienced negative life events, whereas '13UCs' showed 42.7% (p<0.0001). In multivariable logistic analyses adjusted for baseline characteristics, there was a significant regional difference of psychological distress (adjusted odds ratio; aOR in Miyagi UC=1.488; 95%CI, 1.059-2.090). After further adjusting for negative life events, the association was diminished (aOR=1.338; 95%CI, 0.949-1.884). Limitations The JECS had no data before the earthquake and the extent of damage was not investigated. Possible regional representativeness is also a limitation. Conclusion After the Great East Japan Earthquake, the prevalence of pregnant women with psychological distress (K6≥13) were high in Miyagi prefecture. Especially in the coastal area directly affected by tsunami, it is high with or without negative life events experienced. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In March 2005 my nineteen-month-old son, Joe, the eldest of twin boys, died suddenly and unexpectedly during the night. This was not, as many have later come to term it, a “cot death” but rather the result of some chronic and undiagnosed problems that stemmed from his premature birth nearly nineteen months earlier, when he had suffered from a collapsed lung and was variously suspected of brain damage, hearing loss, and digestive disasters. Despite these tentative diagnoses and the exigencies of both his birth and early weeks in the world, Joe remained apparently unaffected by any long-term difficulties. Just six weeks after his untimely entry into the world, both he and his twin brother, Dan, were allowed home to join their four-year-old sister, Amy, who had recently started school. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Introduction. Rivne Polissia inhabitants constitute a population that was most influenced by chronic ionizing radiation due to the Chornobyl disaster. The aim of our investigation was to establish population rates of some congenital anomalies (CA) in Rivne Region during 2000-2014 and their contrasts within the Rivne Region (Polissia vs. non-Polissia), as well as to analyze probable etiological factors. Materials and methods. Introduced in Rivne Region system of active population monitoring of CA and conducted using EUROCAT (European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies) and ICBDSR (International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research) methods, allows controlling data completeness and quality, establishing CA rates and finding their contrasts. We performed statistical analysis of CA registered in 2000-2014. During that period, 231,390 live births were registered in the region. We also studied whole-body counts (WBC) of cesium-137 (Cs-137) among pregnant women. Results. Rivne population rates of neural tube defects (NTD), microcephaly (MIC) and microphthalmia (mOPH) are among the highest in Europe. These rates are statistically significantly higher in Polissia than in non-Polissia. Mean WBC of Cs-137 among pregnant women were statistically significantly higher in Polissia than in non-Polissia. Alcohol screening among 5226 pregnant women conducted during 2010-2014 showed that 3.9% in Polissia and 1.7% in non-Polissia used considerable doses of alcohol. Survey of 4,798 pregnant women in Rivne Region showed that only 7% consumed folic acid (alone or as multivitamin complexes) in preconception period. Conclusions. It is necessary to continue investigations of causes of NTD, MIC and mOPH elevated population rates and their associations with other malformations in Rivne Region and particularly in Polissia, because these associations may have common etiological and pathophysiological mechanisms. The results of such investigations may probably elucidate new important for society facts and help to understand better a complex of causes leading to CA formation, as well as to develop and introduce effective preventive measures. © Authors 2015.

AB  - Tori Amos appeared in the early 1990s as a prototypical confessional singer-songwriter. She sang candidly about the intimate details of a troubled, yet vividly lived life. Her recordings were marked by closely miked vocals and minimal arrangements which sometimes featured only her voice and piano. Both in terms of music and lyrics, it takes great courage to perform in such an exposed and revealing way, and it is difficult to come away from Amos’ performances or recordings without feeling like one has had an up-close and personal encounter with the musician. This effect is the stock-in-trade of the confessional singer-songwriter, and this is one key reason why mass audiences connect so strongly with artists like Amos. Her songs about her strict religious upbringing, her struggles to reconcile her budding sexuality with it, her recounting of rape and recovery, and her later miscarriage have called in a large audience who, in many cases, do more than relate to her experiences; in the manner of a ‘talking cure’, Amos’ songs have a healing effect for some by opening up topics, experiences and feelings that are often kept repressed or hidden. In the analysis below, I consider how Amos’ songs of personal confession and mythology are framed by her cultivation of an image of an almost mystical ‘healer’. Indeed, Amos’ songs cohere around the notion of revelation: Amos reveals personal, spiritual, and symbolic ‘truths’ as a way to heal. Recalling the songs she wrote leading up to her 1991 debut album, Little Earthquakes, Amos said: I think I’m working on that place in me that was terrorised and really afraid. Now when I sing it, it gives me a lot of strength because I’m not running. At a certain point, there does become a place where the heart opens up and people express their fears and pain. That’s when the healing really takes place. Elsewhere, Amos characterises healing through performance as an existential journey into the underworld of the self: ‘I’m very interested in chasing a shadow and chasing the dark side. This is what I do … To heal the wound, you have to go into the dark night of the soul’. The healing journey Amos describes here is self-consciously drawn from shamanism, a form of ritual and mystical healing. © Cambridge University Press 2016.

TEEM allows the travelling personnel to record the most significant patient data, and to send them to the destination center, where the specialist physician will be notified and allowed to inspect the data themselves, possibly providing immediate advice. The exploitation of TEEM also allows to maintain the transportation data over time, for medico-legal purposes, or to perform a-posteriori analyses. The app is currently under evaluation at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Alessandria Children Hospital, Italy. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2016.

AB  - The events of 9/11 released a million tons of toxic dust into lower Manhattan, an unparalleled environmental disaster. It is puzzling, then, that the literature has shown little effect of fetal exposure to the dust. However, inference is complicated by preexisting differences between the affected mothers and other NYC mothers as well as heterogeneity in effects on boys and girls. Using all births in-utero on 9/11 in NYC and comparing them to their siblings, we show that residence in the affected area increased prematurity and low birth weight, especially for boys. © 2016 by the Board of Regents of the University ofWisconsin System.

AB  - Descriptive observational studies showed upward jumps in secular European perinatal mortality trends after Chernobyl. The question arises whether the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident entailed similar phenomena in Japan. For 47 prefectures representing 15.2 million births from 2001 to 2014, the Japanese government provides monthly statistics on 69,171 cases of perinatal death of the fetus or the newborn after 22 weeks of pregnancy to 7 days after birth. Employing change-point methodology for detecting alterations in longitudinal data, we analyzed time trends in perinatal mortality in the Japanese prefectures stratified by exposure to estimate and test potential increases in perinatal death proportions after Fukushima possibly associated with the earthquake, the tsunami, or the estimated radiation exposure. Areas with moderate to high levels of radiation were compared with less exposed and unaffected areas, as were highly contaminated areas hit versus untroubled by the earthquake and the tsunami. Ten months after the earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident, perinatal mortality in 6 severely contaminated prefectures jumped up from January 2012 onward: jump odds ratio 1.156; 95% confidence interval (1.061, 1.259), P-value 0.0009. There were slight increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. In severely contaminated areas, the increases of perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima were essentially independent of the numbers of dead and missing due to the earthquake and the tsunami. Perinatal mortality in areas contaminated with radioactive substances started to increase 10 months after the nuclear accident relative to the prevailing and stable secular downward trend. These results are consistent with findings in Europe after Chernobyl. Since observational studies as the one presented here may suggest but cannot prove causality because of unknown and uncontrolled factors or confounders, intensified research in various scientific disciplines is urgently needed to better qualify and quantify the association of natural and artificial environmental radiation with detrimental genetic health effects at the population level. © 2016 the Author(s).

AB  - The flood that hit Kelantan in December 2014 was the worst in Malaysian history. Women and their infants accounted for a large proportion of the people at risk who were badly affected, as almost half of the population in Kelantan was in the reproductive age group. This report serves to raise awareness that breastfeeding mothers and infants are a special population with unique needs during a disaster. Four of their concerns were identified during this massive flood: first, the negative impact of flood on infant nutritional status and their health; second, open space and lack of privacy for the mothers to breastfeed their babies comfortably at temporary shelters for flood victims; third, uncontrolled donations of infant formula, teats, and feeding bottles that are often received from many sources to promote formula feeding; and lastly, misconceptions related to breastfeeding production and quality that may be affected by the disaster. The susceptibility of women and their infant in a natural disaster enhances the benefits of promoting the breastfeeding rights of women. Women have the right to be supported which enables them to breastfeed. These can be achieved through monitoring the distribution of formula feeding, providing water, electricity and medical care for breastfeeding mothers and their infants. A multifaceted rescue mission team involving various agencies comprising of local government, including the health and nutrition departments, private or non-governmental organizations and individual volunteers have the potential to improve a satisfactory condition of women and infants affected by floods and other potential natural disasters.

AB  - Background: The effect of natural disasters on secondary sex ratio (SSR) and perinatal outcomes has been suggested. This study aimed to examine effects of the Great East Japan Earthquake on perinatal outcomes using vital statistics of Japan. Methods: Birth registration data from vital statistics of Japan between March 2010 and March 2012 were used. Pregnant women who experienced the earthquake were categorized according to their gestational period as of March 11, 2011, as follows: gestational weeks 4-11, 12-19, 20-27, and 28-36 (2011 group). Similarly, pregnant women who did not experience the earthquake were categorized according to their gestational period as of March 11, 2010 and used as controls (2010 group). We also categorized prefectures as "extremely affected", "moderately affected", and "slightly or unaffected" regions. SSR, birth weight, and gestational period were compared between both groups. Results: The number of singleton births was 688 479 in the 2010 group and 679 131 in the 2011 group. In the extremely affected region, the SSR among women at 4-11 weeks of gestation was significantly lower in the 2011 group compared with the 2010 group (49.8% vs 52.1%, P = 0.009). In the extremely affected region, children born to women who experienced the earthquake at 28-36 weeks of gestation had significantly lower birth weights. Conclusions: The SSR declined among women who experienced the earthquake during early pregnancy, particularly in the extremely affected region. However, no apparent negative effect of the earthquake on perinatal outcomes was observed, although birth weight of infants who were born to women who experienced the earthquake at 28-36 weeks of gestation were lower. © 2015 Kohta Suzuki et al.

AB  - Background:To determine whether disaster-related prenatal maternal stress and maternal illness during pregnancy predict maternal-rated temperament status in 6-mo-old infants.Method:The temperamental status of 121 infants (60 boys and 61 girls) exposed in utero to varying degrees of maternal stress and/or illness during either first (n = 40), second (n = 43), or third (n = 38) trimester of pregnancy was assessed using the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire.Results:Higher levels of maternal subjective distress and illness were primarily independently associated with poorer temperamental status in the infants. Maternal subjective distress explained 3.4, 3.1, and 9.8% and early pregnancy illness explained 4.3, 5.8, and 2.9% of the variance of the infants' fussy/difficult, dullness, and needs attention temperament dimensions, respectively.Conclusion:This is the first study to assess whether temperament status is influenced by disaster-related prenatal maternal stress. Moreover, this is the first study to assess whether maternal stress and illness during pregnancy interact to determine infant temperament status. The findings suggest that while both factors predict temperament status at 6 mo, they do so primarily in an independent manner. These results suggest that pathways through which maternal stress and illness during pregnancy influence temperament status differ. © 2016 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a ubiquitous global contaminant with important public health implications. Mercury is released from a variety of anthropogenic, industrial processes, enters the earth's atmosphere and is re-deposited onto the earth's surface in rainfall. Much of this Hg enters the oceans which cover the majority of the earth's surface. In the marine environment, inorganic Hg is converted to the most toxic form of the element, methylmercury, and biomagnified through the trophic levels of the food web. The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is the apex predator in many estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Due to their long life span and trophic position, bottlenose dolphins bioaccumulate high concentrations of contaminants including Hg, thus making them an important sentinel species for ecosystem and public health. Bottlenose dolphins in Florida bioaccumulate high concentrations of Hg in their blood, skin and internal organs. The concentrations of Hg in blood and skin of bottlenose dolphins of the Indian River Lagoon, FL (IRL) are among the highest reported world-wide. In previous studies, we demonstrated associations between concentrations of total Hg in the blood and skin of IRL dolphins and markers of endocrine, renal, hepatic, hematologic and immune system dysfunction. The predominant manifestation of exposure to mercury in humans is neurotoxicity. During the 1950s and 1960s, residents of Minamata bay, Japan were exposed to high concentrations of methyl mercury as the result of ingestion of fish and shellfish that had become contaminated in this infamous environmental disaster. Affected adults had severe motor and sensory abnormalities often leading to death. Methyl mercury crosses the placenta during pregnancy. Children exposed in utero were born with multiple congenital anomalies and also suffered from neurologic disorders. Significantly, local cats that consumed Hg contaminated fish developed severe signs of neurotoxicity which led to their subsequent description as the "dancing cats of Minamata bay". Unfortunately, the cause of these strange manifestations in cats was not recognized in time to prevent hundreds of additional cases from occurring. More recent studies have shown that exposure to mercury as a result of seafood consumption during pregnancy may result in multiple cognitive and neurodevelopmental effects in children. The levels of mercury found in bottlenose dolphins and the health effects we identified alerted us to the possibility of an important public health hazard. The IRL occupies 40 percent of the east coast of Florida and is bordered by counties with approximately 2.5 million human inhabitants. Therefore, we hypothesized that local inhabitants in communities bordering the IRL could be at risk of exposure to Hg from the consumption of fish and shellfish. We measured hair Hg in 135 local residents and found a mean concentration of 1.53 μg/g which was higher than that from previous studies of sport fishermen and coastal residents in other states. Over 50% of participants had a hair Hg concentration which exceeded the U.S. EPA exposure guideline. Hair Hg concentration was directly related to the frequency of seafood consumption and to the proportion of fish and shellfish obtained from local recreational sources. This study clearly exemplifies the importance of an animal sentinel in identifying a public health hazard and is virtually unique in "closing the loop" between animal and human health. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - Disaster exposure during pregnancy has received limited attention. This study examined the impact of the 2008 Iowa Floods on perinatal maternal depression and well-being, and the role of peritraumatic distress as a possible mechanism explaining this link. Perinatal women (N = 171) completed measures of depressive symptoms and general well-being at 5 timepoints from pregnancy to 30 months postpartum. Objectively assessed prenatal flood exposure was associated with greater depression (r = .15). Further, flood-related peritraumatic distress was uniquely associated with greater depression (r = .23), and was a key mechanism through which flood exposure led to depression. Prenatal flood exposure was also associated with general well-being (r = .18); however, a mechanism other than peritraumatic distress appears to have been responsible for the effect of flood exposure on well-being. We discuss the implications of these findings for informing etiological models and enhancing the efficacy of interventions for maternal psychopathology. © 2015 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.

AB  - Climate change policies have stimulated a shift towards renewable energy sources such as biomass. The economic crisis of 2008 has also increased the practice of household biomass burning as it is often cheaper than using oil, gas or electricity for heating. As a result, household biomass combustion is becoming an important source of air pollutants in the European Union. This position paper discusses the contribution of biomass combustion to pollution levels in Europe, and the emerging evidence on the adverse health effects of biomass combustion products. Epidemiological studies in the developed world have documented associations between indoor and outdoor exposure to biomass combustion products and a range of adverse health effects. A conservative estimate of the current contribution of biomass smoke to premature mortality in Europe amounts to at least 40 000 deaths per year. We conclude that emissions from current biomass combustion products negatively affect respiratory and, possibly, cardiovascular health in Europe. Biomass combustion emissions, in contrast to emissions from most other sources of air pollution, are increasing. More needs to be done to further document the health effects of biomass combustion in Europe, and to reduce emissions of harmful biomass combustion products to protect public health. © © ERS 2015.

AB  - Background Prehospital emergency care training programs are effective in reducing mortality and disability in low-income countries. Implementation of a specifically designed program in the mountainous regions of Nepal has the potential to benefit local populations, trekking and mountaineering guides, and adventure tourists. Objective Our aims were to survey Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA) members' past experiences with emergencies and medical training, characterize a geographic-specific prehospital emergency care training program, and evaluate the effectiveness and outcome of the program. Methods Sixty-two trekking guides, police officers, and students attended the 2-day training program in Pokhara, Nepal in May 2014. Training curriculum was determined in coordination with the NMA. Instructors included Tulane University faculty, surgical residents, and graduate students. Surveys identified participants' experience with emergencies, confidence in providing emergency care, and interest in future trainings. Multiple modalities were utilized to assess trainees' comprehension. Results Participants rated the program as valuable and expressed desire for additional trainings. Survey results indicated that participants had prior experience with a myriad of emergencies, were more confident in managing traumatic emergencies than medical or environmental, and showed that few had previously received training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Areas of instruction included general first responder and geographic-specific content. Participants achieved the course objectives and documented their abilities to successfully manage simulated clinical problems. Conclusions The training program, an international collaboration, was documented to be successful by instructors, NMA leadership, and participants. The training program's content matched the participants' specific needs and abilities. Areas for improvement include providing content related to burns, motorcycle injuries, cold-exposure injuries, fever management, and toxicology emergencies. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper identifies the low-elevation coastal zone (LECZ) populations and developing regions most vulnerable to sea-level rise and other coastal hazards, such as storm surges, coastal erosion and salt-water intrusion. The focus is on the rural poor in the LECZ, as their economic livelihoods are especially endangered both directly by coastal hazards and indirectly through the impacts of climate change on key coastal and near-shore ecosystems. Using geo-spatially referenced malnutrition and infant mortality data for 2000 as a proxy for poverty, this study finds that just 15 developing countries contain over 90% of the world's LECZ rural poor. Low-income countries as a group have the highest incidence of poverty, which declines somewhat for lower middle-income countries, and then is much lower for upper middle-income economies. South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific and Sub-Saharan Africa account for most of the world's LECZ rural poor, and have a high incidence of poverty among their rural LECZ populations. Although fostering growth, especially in coastal areas, may reduce rural poverty in the LECZ, additional policy actions will be required to protect vulnerable communities from disasters, to conserve and restore key coastal and near-shore ecosystems, and to promote key infrastructure investments and coastal community response capability. © 2015.

AB  - Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabit bays, sounds and estuaries across the Gulf of Mexico. Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, studieswere initiated to assess potential effects on these ecologically important apex predators. A previous study reported disease conditions, including lung disease and impaired stress response, for 32 dolphins that were temporarily captured and given health assessments in Barataria Bay, Louisiana, USA. Ten of the sampled dolphins were determined to be pregnant, with expected due dates the following spring or summer. Here, we report findings after 47 months of follow-up monitoring of those sampled dolphins. Only 20% (95% CI: 2.50–55.6%) of the pregnant dolphins produced viable calves, as compared with a previously reported pregnancy success rate of 83% in a reference population. Fifty-seven per cent of pregnant females that did not successfully produce a calf had been previously diagnosed with moderate– severe lung disease. In addition, the estimated annual survival rate of the sampled cohort was low (86.8%, 95% CI: 80.0–92.7%) as compared with survival rates of 95.1% and 96.2% from two other previously studied bottlenose dolphin populations. Our findings confirm low reproductive success and high mortality in dolphins from a heavily oiled estuary when compared with other populations. Follow-up studies are needed to better understand the potential recovery of dolphins in Barataria Bay and, by extension, other Gulf coastal regions impacted by the spill. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Objectives: To examine how the recovery following Hurricane Katrina affected pregnancy outcomes. Methods: 308 New Orleans area pregnant women were interviewed 5–7 years after Hurricane Katrina about their exposure to the disaster (danger, damage, and injury); current disruption; and perceptions of recovery. Birthweight, gestational age, birth length, and head circumference were examined in linear models, and low birthweight (<2500 g) and preterm birth (<37 weeks) in logistic models, with adjustment for confounders. Results: Associations were found between experiencing damage during Katrina and birthweight (adjusted beta for high exposure = −158 g) and between injury and gestational age (adjusted beta = −0.5 days). Of the indicators of recovery experience, most consistently associated with worsened birth outcomes was worry that another hurricane would hit the region (adjusted beta for birthweight: −112 g, p = 0.08; gestational age: −3.2 days, p = 0.02; birth length: −0.65 cm, p = 0.06). Conclusions: Natural disaster may have long-term effects on pregnancy outcomes. Alternately, women who are most vulnerable to disaster may be also vulnerable to poor pregnancy outcome. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Disasters and displacement increasingly affect and challenge urban settings. How do pregnant women fare in the aftermath of a major disaster? This paper investigates the effect of pregnancies in disaster situations. The study tests a hypothesis that pregnant women residing in hurricane-prone areas suffer higher health risks. The setting is Louisiana in the Gulf Coast, United States, a state that continually experiences hurricane impacts. The time period for the analysis is three years following the landfall of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. We analysed low birth weight and preterm deliveries before and after landfall, as a whole and by race. Findings support an association between hazards and health of a community and indicate that pregnant women in the affected area, irrespective of race, are more likely to experience preterm deliveries compared to pre-event births. Results suggest there is a negative health legacy impact in Louisiana as a result of hurricane landfall. © Overseas Development Institute, 2015.

AB  - Background: Haiti's surgical capacity was significantly strained by the 2010 earthquake. As the government and its partners rebuild the health system, emergency and essential surgical care must be a priority. Methods: A validated, facility-based assessment tool developed by WHO was completed by 45 hospitals nationwide. The hospitals were assessed for (1) infrastructure, (2) human resources, (3) surgical interventions and emergency care, and (4) material resources for resuscitation. Fisher's exact test was used to compare hospitals by sectors: public compared to private and mixed (public-private partnerships). Results: The 45 hospitals included first-referral level to the national referral hospital: 20 were public sector and 25 were private or mixed sector. Blood banks (33 % availability) and oxygen concentrators (58 %) were notable infrastructural deficits. For human resources, 69 % and 33 % of hospitals employed at least one full-time surgeon and anaesthesiologist, respectively. Ninety-eight percent of hospitals reported capacity to perform resuscitation. General and obstetrical surgical interventions were relatively more available, for example 93 % provided hernia repairs and 98 % provided cesarean sections. More specialized interventions were at a deficit: cataract surgery (27 %), cleft repairs (31 %), clubfoot (42 %), and open treatment of fractures (51 %). Conclusion: Deficiencies in infrastructure and material resources were widespread and should be urgently addressed. Physician providers were mal-distributed relative to non-physician providers. Formal task-sharing to midlevel and general physician providers should be considered. The parity between public and private or mixed sector hospitals in availability of Ob/Gyn surgical interventions is evidence of concerted efforts to reduce maternal mortality. This ought to provide a roadmap for strengthening of surgical care capacity. © 2015 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.

AB  - Embolization of uterine arteriovenous malformations is usually performed angiographically via transfemoral arterial approach. In this report, ultrasound guided transcutaneous embolization of a uterine arteriovenous malformation, using color Doppler, was successfully performed in one patient with intractable vaginal bleeding. There were no complications following the procedure, and complete cessation of blood flow in the uterine arteriovenous malformation was achieved. This technique may be an alternative treatment option for recurrent heavy vaginal bleeding secondary to uterine arteriovenous malformation. © 2015 Elsevier Taiwan LLC and the Chinese Taipei Society of Ultrasound in Medicine.

AB  - On July 17, 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down, a tragedy that shocked the Dutch population. As part of a large longitudinal survey on mental health in pregnant women that had a study inclusion period of 19 months, we were able to evaluate the possible association of that incident with mood changes using pre- and postdisaster data. We compared mean Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) scores from a group of women (n = 126 cases) at 32 weeks' gestation during the first month after the crash with mean scores from a control group (n = 102) with similar characteristics who completed the EDS at 32 weeks' gestation during the same summer period in 2013. The mean EDS scores of the 126 case women in the first month after the crash were significantly higher than the scores of 102 control women. There were no differences in mean EDS scores between the 2 groups at the first and second trimesters. The present study is among the first in which perinatal mental health before and after the occurrence of a disaster has been investigated, and the results suggest that national disasters might lead to emotional responses. © The Author 2015.

AB  - The study was conducted with the primary objective to establish the influence of FecB gene mutation on the growth and reproductive performance of Garole × Malpura ewes. The duration of the study was for 5 months involving 97 adult Garole × Malpura (GM) ewes. These 97 animals were segregated based on FecB genotype and the animals were divided into three groups as group I (FecBBB; n = 13), group II (FecBB+; n = 65), and group III (FecB++; n = 19). All the animals were kept under semi-intensive management system by subjecting the animals to grazing during day time and housing them in the night. Apart from grazing, ewes were provided with concentrate mixture at the rate of 150 g/day/ewe. The ewes in estrus after 12 h of onset of estrus were hand mated twice at 12-h intervals with a ram of proven fertility in the morning and evening. The pregnancy was confirmed by real time B-mode transabdominal ultrasonography. The experiment was continued until lambing. Under the treatments of different FecB genotype, the ewe’s growth and reproductive parameters were assessed. FecB genotype significantly (P < 0.05) influenced body weight, heart girth, pin shoulder length, height at wither, lambing percentage, litter size, twinning percentage, and birth weight of lambs. From this study, it can be concluded that breeding Galore and Malpura breed shall help insure an economically viable production system. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the health effects of prenatal exposure to disaster, based on a systematic review of existing research. Methods: A literature search of scientific databases was conducted in February 2015 for articles on prenatal exposure to a natural or man-made disaster. Data was extracted from all articles that met the inclusion criteria, and we systematically analyzed contents based on type of disaster, health outcome, target group and time after birth. Results: Prenatal exposure to famine or war was found to be associated with mental health, cardiovascular or metabolic outcomes, with varying degrees of significance. The majority of the studies showed limited or weak associations between exposures and outcomes. Conclusions: Due to the lack of variety in type of events studied, as well as large methodological variation, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from existing literature. However, our systematic review highlights the potential of evaluating secondary data, both to accentuate research gaps in the field and to increase the understanding of what effects various types of disasters potentially have on the unborn child. © 2015, Swiss School of Public Health.

AB  - The Dechorinated Zebrafish Embryo Developmental toxicity assay was originally developed from a training set of 31 compounds and reported to be 87% concordant with in vivo teratogenicity data (Brannen, K. C., Panzica-Kelly, J. M., Danberry, T. L., and Augustine-Rauch, K. A. (2010). Development of a zebrafish embryo teratogenicity assay and quantitative prediction model. Birth Defects Res. 89, 66-77.). The assay includes scoring larva treated in a concentration range for malformations of specific morphological structures/organ systems. The model includes identifying a no-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and the concentration resulting in 25% lethality (LC<inf>25</inf>) at 5 days postfertilization. An LC<inf>25</inf>/NOAEL ratio ≥10 classifies a compound positive for teratogenic potential. A consortium effort evaluated a modified version of this assay which involved enzymatic chorion treatment instead of manual dissection and used experimental replicates for final classification. The modified assay achieved an 85% overall predictivity (Gustafson, A. L., Stedman, D. B., Ball, J., Hillegass, J. M., Flood, A., Zhang, C. X., Panzica-Kelly, J., Cao, J., Coburn, A., Enright, B. P., et al. (2012). Inter-laboratory assessment of a harmonized zebrafish developmental toxicology assay - progress report on phase I. Reprod. Toxicol. 33, 155-164.). The objective of this study was to perform a thorough performance evaluation of the dechorinated assay by repeating the original training set and testing additional compounds in experimental replicates. When the initial training set was repeated with inclusion of experimental replicates, the overall predictivity was 83%. Model performance was tested with an additional 34 compounds and achieved overall predictivity of 74%. When the training and test sets were combined (63 compounds) the assay's final sensitivity was 83% and the specificity was 71%. Total predictivity was 78% with relatively balanced predictivity for nonteratogens (77%) and teratogens (78%). The chorion-offassay achieved superior sensitivity (83%) compared with sensitivity (63-74%) reported by consortium efforts testing a similar assay with chorion-intact embryos (Ball, J. S., Stedman, D. B., Hillegass, J. M., Zhang, C. X., Panzica-Kelly, J., Coburn, A., Enright, B. P., Tornesi, B., Amouzadeh, H. R., Hetheridge, M., et al. (2014). Fishing for teratogens: a consortium effort for a harmonized zebrafish developmental toxicology assay. Toxicol. Sci. 139, 210-219.).

AB  - Telemedicine is a technological tool that is improving the health of children around the world. This report chronicles the use of telemedicine by pediatricians and pediatric medical and surgical specialists to deliver inpatient and outpatient care, educate physicians and patients, and conduct medical research. It also describes the importance of telemedicine in responding to emergencies and disasters and providing access to pediatric care to remote and underserved populations. Barriers to telemedicine expansion are explained, such as legal issues, inadequate payment for services, technology costs and sustainability, and the lack of technology infrastructure on a national scale. Although certain challenges have constrained more widespread implementation, telemedicine's current use bears testimony to its effectiveness and potential. Telemedicine's widespread adoption will be influenced by the implementation of key provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, technological advances, and growing patient demand for virtual visits. © 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - Research in environmental toxicology involving pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has increased greatly over the last 10-15 years. Much research has been focused on the endocrine-disrupting potential of PPCPs, as they relate to negative population impacts of aquatic organisms. This review assesses the current data on the reported effects of PPCPs on fish reproduction with an emphasis on fecundity, a predictor of population effects. Studies of both individual PPCPs and PPCP mixtures are presented. As the majority of individual PPCP studies reviewed demonstrate negative effects on fish fecundity, we relate these findings to detected surface water concentrations of these compounds. Very few studies involving PPCP mixtures have been conducted; however, the need for these types of studies is warranted as fish are most likely exposed to mixtures of PPCPs in the wild. In addition, laboratory and field assessments of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, a major source of PPCPs, are reviewed. Much of the data provided from these assessments are variable and do not generally demonstrate negative impacts on reproduction, or the studies are unable to directly associate observed effects with WWTP effluents. Finally, future research considerations are outlined to provide an avenue into understanding how wild populations of fish are affected by PPCPs. These considerations are aimed at determining the adaptation potential of fish exposed to mixtures of PPCPs over multiple generations. As global use of PPCPs continually rises, the need to discern the effects of chronic exposure to PPCPs is greatly increased. © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - The present meta-analysis addresses the relation between maternal prenatal stress (MPS) and infant birth weight and gestational age in 88 prospective studies (N = 5,889,930) published between 1970 and 2012. The results suggest that this relation is significant (d = -12; 95% CI: -17, -08). Three factors moderated overall effect size: 1) The type of MPS assessment: Pregnancy-related stress and anxiety yielded greater effect sizes (d = -25; 95% CI:-32, -18; k = 22) than trait-based assessments (d = -13; 95% CI:-22, -03; k = 22), life event measures (d = -03; 95% CI:-05, -01; k = 55) or exposure to natural disasters (d = -11; 95% CI:-21, -02; k = 24). Both state (d = -14; 95% CI:-25, -03; k = 82) and trait MPS assessments yielded greater effect sizes than life event measures of stress; 2) studies involving high-risk samples tended to yield greater associations (d = -26; 95% CI: -44, -09; k = 16) than those involving low-risk groups (d = -08; 95% CI: -13, .04; k = 72); 3) studies conducted outside of North America (d = -01; 95% CI: -14, -06; k = 50) or Europe (d = -06; 95% CI: -12, -01; k = 31) yielded greater effect sizes than studies conducted in other parts of the world (d = -70; 95% CI: -1.14, -24; k = 7). Discussion focuses on the need to identify the kinds of stress most related to birth outcome, as well as the biological and environmental contexts that serve to mediate this relation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of season, year of lambing, parity, and the effect of ram on litter size, birth, and weaning weight through 8 years. Data of 4078 lambs sired by 21 rams and 1072 ewes were analyzed by a lineal model. There was a significant effect (P < 0.05) of lambing number on litter size and birth weight, but not on weaning weight (P > 0.05). For litter size, the lowest numbers were obtained on the first lambing ewes (1.21 ± 0.03) and the highest ones inewes starting from the fourth lambing (1.69 ± 0.04). Lowest body weights were found in lambs born from first lambing ewes (3.01 ± 0.1 kg) and the highest ones in lambs born from the second (3.14 ± 0.1) to the fifth (3.15 ± 0.2) lambing ewes. The lambing breeding season had a significant effect on weaning weight: the highest weaning weights were recorded in lambs born in spring (12.70 ± 0.20 kg) and the lowest ones in those born in summer (11.93 ± 0.20 kg). Lambing year had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on litter size and weaning weight, since the values of both traits improved through the years. Effect of ram was significant (P < 0.05) for each of the traits considered: there were differences up to one lamb per litter, also differences up to 1.5 kg for birth weight and up to 6.5 kg for weaning weight among rams. In conclusion, these results indicate that environmental conditions are important source of variation in litter size, birth, and weaning weight in hair sheep under semi-arid climate. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) predicts psychosocial development in offspring. It has been hypothesized that during PNMS, glucocorticoids pass the placenta, reaching the foetus, leading to a long-term reprogramming and dysregulation of the foetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, results are inconsistent across PNMS studies. One problem may be the confounding of objective degrees of hardship due to the stressor and subjective degrees of distress in the mother. The present study investigated the association between objective and subjective PNMS due to a natural disaster, the June 2008 Iowa floods, and stress reactivity in the offspring at 21/2 years of age. Women who were pregnant during the floods were recruited, on average, within three months of the floods and their stress levels assessed. Mothers and their toddlers (. n=. 94. dyads) participated in a brief mother-toddler separation to induce physiological stress responses in the offspring. Salivary cortisol samples were collected four times during the procedure. We computed absolute change in cortisol (baseline to 20-minute post-stressor; baseline to 45-minute post-stressor) and Area Under the Curve with respect to increase and ground (AUCi; AUCg). Objective and subjective PNMS were positively correlated with AUCi, as was timing in gestation: the later in pregnancy the exposure occurred, the greater the cortisol increase. Controlling for objective hardship and other covariates, sex-by-subjective PNMS interactions showed a significant and positive association between subjective PNMS and Absolute Increase (45. min) and AUCi in females only, with little effect in males. These results suggest that PNMS leads to long-term alterations in the functioning of the HPA axis, evident as early as 30-months of age. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION Does an acute calamity in a community cause early miscarriage and is this association the same for male and female fetuses? SUMMARY ANSWER Estimated losses of 29.5% of first trimester pregnancies in the affected region could be associated with an acute calamity, with no statistically significant difference in estimated losses by fetal sex. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY There are very few studies on the impact of a calamity on early pregnancy loss and its differential effects on male and female fetuses. A decline in the human sex ratio at birth associated with the events of 9/11 in New York has been documented. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This is a retrospective descriptive study of birth register data in Tasmania, Australia, from 1991 to 1997, covering the period in which the calamity occurred. The register contains data on all pregnancies that proceeded to >20 weeks gestation. The conception date was calculated by subtracting gestational age from birth date. We estimated that 40 318 pregnancies were conceived in the period 1991-1996 inclusive. These were aggregated to 4-weekly blocks classified by region and sex. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS The acute calamity was at Port Arthur, Tasmania, Australia. On 28 April 1996, a gunman opened fire on visitors and staff in a tourist cafe. A very stressful 20 h period, ended with 35 people dead and 22 injured. A negative binomial regression model was used to assess the association between this calamity and pregnancy loss. This loss is evidenced by a shortfall in the registration of pregnancies that were in their first trimester at the time of the calamity. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE We estimated a shortfall of 29.5% or 229 registered pregnancies among those in the first trimester at the time of the calamity (P < 0.001), in the region surrounding the calamity site. There was no sex effect in this shortfall (P = 0.911). There was no corresponding shortfall in other parts of Tasmania (P = 0.349). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The study is descriptive and cannot produce causal inferences. These first trimester miscarriages are estimated statistically and it is understood that gestational age is an estimate. The use of maternal residential postcodes at birth as a surrogate for geographic area or space assumes that the mother has not moved into the postcode area after the calamity and before the reporting of a birth. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The results of this study suggest that calamities bring about significant pregnancy loss affecting both sexes. The methodology presented of inferring conception date from birth date and using this for analysis, provides a more accurate assessment of first trimester pregnancy losses than raw birth data or sex ratio at birth.

AB  - Background: Retrospective studies suggest that maternal exposure to a severe stressor during pregnancy increases the fetus' risk for a variety of disorders in adulthood. Animal studies testing the fetal programming hypothesis find that maternal glucocorticoids pass through the placenta and alter fetal brain development, particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. However, there are no prospective studies of pregnant women exposed to a sudden-onset independent stressor that elucidate the biopsychosocial mechanisms responsible for the wide variety of consequences of prenatal stress seen in human offspring. The aim of the QF2011 Queensland Flood Study is to fill this gap, and to test the buffering effects of Midwifery Group Practice, a form of continuity of maternity care. Methods/design: In January 2011 Queensland, Australia had its worst flooding in 30 years. Simultaneously, researchers in Brisbane were collecting psychosocial data on pregnant women for a randomized control trial (the M@NGO Trial) comparing Midwifery Group Practice to standard care. We invited these and other pregnant women to participate in a prospective, longitudinal study of the effects of prenatal maternal stress from the floods on maternal, perinatal and early childhood outcomes. Data collection included assessment of objective hardship and subjective distress from the floods at recruitment and again 12 months post-flood. Biological samples included maternal bloods at 36 weeks pregnancy, umbilical cord, cord blood, and placental tissues at birth. Questionnaires assessing maternal and child outcomes were sent to women at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. The protocol includes assessments at 16 months, 2 1/2 and 4 years. Outcomes include maternal psychopathology, and the child's cognitive, behavioral, motor and physical development. Additional biological samples include maternal and child DNA, as well as child testosterone, diurnal and reactive cortisol. Discussion: This prenatal stress study is the first of its kind, and will fill important gaps in the literature. Analyses will determine the extent to which flood exposure influences the maternal biological stress response which may then affect the maternal-placental-fetal axis at the biological, biochemical, and molecular levels, altering fetal development and influencing outcomes in the offspring. The role of Midwifery Group Practice in moderating effects of maternal stress will be tested. © 2015 King et al.

AB  - During and after disasters, focus is directed toward meeting the immediate needs of the general population. As a result, the routine health care and the special needs of some vulnerable populations such as pregnant and postpartum women may be overlooked within a resource-limited setting. In the event of hazards such as natural disasters, manmade disasters, and terrorism, knowledge of emergency preparedness strategies is imperative for the pregnant woman and her family, obstetric providers, and hospitals. Individualized plans for the pregnant woman and her family should include knowledge of shelter in place, birth at home, and evacuation. Obstetric providers need to have a personal disaster plan in place that accounts for work responsibilities in case of an emergency and business continuity strategies to continue to provide care to their communities. Hospitals should have a comprehensive emergency preparedness program utilizing an "all hazards" approach to meet the needs of pregnant and postpartum women and other vulnerable populations during disasters. With lessons learned in recent tragedies such as Hurricane Katrina in mind, we hope this review will stimulate emergency preparedness discussions and actions among obstetric providers and attenuate adverse outcomes related to catastrophes in the future. © 2015 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Cardiac arrest in pregnancy is a rare but catastrophic obstetric emergency, with a quoted incidence of 1:20,000 pregnancies. Speedy multidisciplinary interventions are crucial for good maternal and foetal outcomes. A perimortem caesarean section (PMCS) initiated within 4 min of onset of cardiac arrest to minimise the effect of aortocaval compression on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been recommended as a key intervention, which is likely to improve survival of both mother and foetus. Sudden collapse is uncommon in pregnant women and their management is more challenging than in a non-pregnant patient. This article aims to emphasise the significance of early identification and management of impending or established maternal cardiac arrest. We propose that a focus on effective and good-quality CPR, utilising key interventions such as early airway control, left uterine displacement and a timely decision for a PMCS with multidisciplinary input is more likely to result in good maternal and foetal survival and neurological outcomes. We also discuss the role of ‘fire drill’ obstetric training for key staff and the use of a dedicated hospital-wide resuscitation code for managing collapse in obstetric patients in improving survival and outcomes. We present four cases of maternal cardiac arrest managed with PMCS in our hospital, highlighting the evolution in management and with improved outcomes following changes to our resuscitation guidelines, training and workflows. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Indonesia has been making good progress in reproductive health (RH) outcome. This study aimed to examine the effect of the September 2009 Sumatra earthquake on availability and accessibility of RH services and its possible impact on local Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Twenty-six health facilities in Padang City were reviewed and 667 clients directly interviewed. Water supply shortage was most widespread and slowest to recover, taking more than 1 year to normalize. Antenatal and emergency obstetric care was minimally disrupted, and family planning practice of the study couples was not changed by the earthquake. The previous rate of improvement in maternal and child mortality was slowed down, whereas stillbirths increased after the earthquake. Thus, there is a need to speed up the recovery to achieve the local MDGs. © 2013 APJPH.

AB  - Objective: To examine the relationship between maternal stress exposure, stress coping styles, and pregnancy complications. Design: Quantitative, cross-sectional, and prospective study. Setting: Tulane-Lakeside Hospital, New Orleans, LA and Women's Hospital, Baton Rouge, LA. Participants: The study included 146 women (122 from New Orleans and 24 from Baton Rouge), who were pregnant during or immediately after Hurricane Katrina. Methods: Participants were interviewed regarding their hurricane experiences and perceived stress, and coping styles were assessed using the Brief COPE. Medical charts were also reviewed to obtain information about pregnancy outcomes. Logistic regression was performed to determine possible associations. Results: Hurricane exposure was significantly associated with induction of labor (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.03, 1.86], P = .03) and current perceived stress (aOR = 1.50, CI [1.34, 1.99], P < .01). Stress perception significantly predisposed to pregnancy-induced hypertension (aOR = 1.16, CI [1.05, 1.30], P < .01) and gestational diabetes (aOR = 1.13, CI [1.02, 1.25], P = .03). Use of planning, acceptance, humor, instrumental support, and venting coping styles were associated with a significantly reduced occurrence of pregnancy complications (P < .05). Higher rates for gestational diabetes was found among women using the denial coping style (aOR = 2.25, CI [1.14, 4.45], P = .02). Conclusion: Exposure to disaster-related stress may complicate pregnancy, whereas some coping styles may mitigate its effects. Further research should explore how coping styles may mitigate or exacerbate the effect of major stressors and how positive coping styles can be encouraged or augmented. © 2015 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.

AB  - Bhopal was the site of the world's worst industrial disaster, when on December 3, 1984 nearly 40 metric tons of methyl isocyanate (MIC) leaked from the Union Carbide Pesticide Plant and being heavier than air MIC settled on the ground. MIC is the smallest and the most toxic of all isocyanates; it affected all life forms, killed nearly 8,000 people within 48 hours by producing pulmonary edema, and produced lasting effects on more than 200,000 residents. There is no antidote against MIC although sodium thiosulfate was administered in the mistaken belief that the culprit chemical was hydrogen cyanide. Studies done on experimental animals after the accident largely confirm what was observed on the Bhopal population. Nearly 40% of women pregnant at the time of the disaster lost their fetuses. Chronic effects include pulmonary, gynecological, ocular, neurological and other complications. MIC metabolites are also toxic and some like trimethylamine exert selective toxicity on male progeny. Large quantities of highly toxic chemical waste stored in the factory premises have contaminated the soil and water. The Bhopal disaster revealed dangers inherent in chemical industries and the need of stringent regulations and supervision to ensure safety. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background Up-to-date evidence on levels and trends for age-sex-specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality is essential for the formation of global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) we estimated yearly deaths for 188 countries between 1990, and 2013. We used the results to assess whether there is epidemiological convergence across countries. Methods We estimated age-sex-specific all-cause mortality using the GBD 2010 methods with some refinements to improve accuracy applied to an updated database of vital registration, survey, and census data. We generally estimated cause of death as in the GBD 2010. Key improvements included the addition of more recent vital registration data for 72 countries, an updated verbal autopsy literature review, two new and detailed data systems for China, and more detail for Mexico, UK, Turkey, and Russia. We improved statistical models for garbage code redistribution. We used six different modelling strategies across the 240 causes; cause of death ensemble modelling (CODEm) was the dominant strategy for causes with sufficient information. Trends for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were informed by meta-regression of prevalence studies. For pathogen-specific causes of diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections we used a counterfactual approach. We computed two measures of convergence (inequality) across countries: the average relative difference across all pairs of countries (Gini coefficient) and the average absolute difference across countries. To summarise broad findings, we used multiple decrement life-tables to decompose probabilities of death from birth to exact age 15 years, from exact age 15 years to exact age 50 years, and from exact age 50 years to exact age 75 years, and life expectancy at birth into major causes. For all quantities reported, we computed 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We constrained cause-specific fractions within each age-sex-country-year group to sum to all-cause mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions. Findings Global life expectancy for both sexes increased from 65·3 years (UI 65·0-65·6) in 1990, to 71·5 years (UI 71·0-71·9) in 2013, while the number of deaths increased from 47·5 million (UI 46·8-48·2) to 54·9 million (UI 53·6-56·3) over the same interval. Global progress masked variation by age and sex: for children, average absolute differences between countries decreased but relative differences increased. For women aged 25-39 years and older than 75 years and for men aged 20-49 years and 65 years and older, both absolute and relative differences increased. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the prominent role of reductions in age-standardised death rates for cardiovascular diseases and cancers in high-income regions, and reductions in child deaths from diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and neonatal causes in low-income regions. HIV/AIDS reduced life expectancy in southern sub-Saharan Africa. For most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell whereas for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts have increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates. Global deaths from injury increased by 10·7%, from 4·3 million deaths in 1990 to 4·8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over the same period by 21%. For some causes of more than 100 000 deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 2013, including HIV/AIDS, pancreatic cancer, atrial fibrillation and flutter, drug use disorders, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and sickle-cell anaemias. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes, and malaria are still in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The most important pathogens are rotavirus for diarrhoea and pneumococcus for lower respiratory infections. Country-specific probabilities of death over three phases of life were substantially varied between and within regions. Interpretation For most countries, the general pattern of reductions in age-sex specific mortality has been associated with a progressive shift towards a larger share of the remaining deaths caused by non-communicable disease and injuries. Assessing epidemiological convergence across countries depends on whether an absolute or relative measure of inequality is used. Nevertheless, age-standardised death rates for seven substantial causes are increasing, suggesting the potential for reversals in some countries. Important gaps exist in the empirical data for cause of death estimates for some countries; for example, no national data for India are available for the past decade.

AB  - Get the tools to help the grief that comes when a dream dies Every person at one time or another suffers when his or her dreams are shattered. Creative Interventions in Grief and Loss Therapy: When the Music Stops, a Dream Dies provides truly innovative approaches to therapeutically help individuals work through and survive grief and loss. Leading experts explore creative interventions for common, yet emotionally devastating problems faced by those weathering the storms of grief after their dream has been destroyed. Therapists and counselors get the effective tools to creatively help people through the difficulties of dealing with death, addiction, trauma, changes in life circumstances, divorce, heartbreak, miscarriage, co-occurring mental health and substance use disorder (COD), suicide, adoption, and issues with children. The chapters in this innovative volume cite existing research on specific grief and loss issues and illustrate a clinical application for each situation using various creative mediums such as music, writing, or ritual. Each approach can be expanded and modified with care by clinicians of all types to better help clients through the process. This resource is extensively referenced. Topics in Creative Interventions in Grief and Loss Therapy include: how storytelling, journaling, and correspondence can be used to process the experience of a counselor’s loss following the death of their client using psychodrama and the utilization of empty chair techniques to address addiction related grief and loss the use of rituals as an intervention to help clients trauma and loss during times of natural disasters the process of gatekeeping by counselor educators Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) as an approach to help student athletes deal with life after the sport a literary exercise to help clients work toward forgiveness after divorce using books, songs, and projects to assistclients experiencing grief after the death of their adolescent child creative strategies to aid clients through the grief and loss of love effective interventions to assist clients through loss from miscarriage using music, videography, visual arts, literature, drama, play, and altar-making in the grief process innovative interventions for individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorder suicide high risk factors—and a Pre-suicide Preparation Plan that mental health practitioners can implement creative intervention for the client who is adopted using super heroes and science fiction therapeutic storytelling for children in grief Creative Interventions in Grief and Loss Therapy: When the Music Stops, a Dream Dies is a creative, reaffirming resource perfect for mental health professionals, therapists, counselors, social workers, educators, and students. © 2005 by The Haworth Press.

AB  - Background and objectives: Maternal stress can depress birth weight and gestational age, with potential health effects. A growing number of studies examine the effect of maternal stress caused by environmental disasters on birth outcomes. These changes may indicate an adaptive response. In this study, we examine the effects of maternal exposure to wildfire on birth weight and gestational age, hypothesising that maternal stress will negatively influence these measures. Methodology: Using data from the Australian Capital Territory, we employed Analysis of Variance to examine the influence of the 2003 Canberra wildfires on the weight of babies born to mothers resident in fire-affected regions, while considering the role of other factors. Results: We found that male infants born in the most severely fire-affected area had significantly higher average birth weights than their less exposed peers and were also heavier than males born in the same areas in non-fire years. Higher average weights were attributable to an increase in the number of macrosomic infants. There was no significant effect on the weight of female infants or on gestational age for either sex. Conclusions and implications: Our findings indicate heightened environmental responsivity in the male cohort. We find that elevated maternal stress acted to accelerate the growth of male fetuses, potentially through an elevation of maternal blood glucose levels. Like previous studies, our work finds effects of disaster exposure and suggests that fetal growth patterns respond to maternal signals. However, the direction of the change in birth weight is opposite to that of many earlier studies. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Fukushima Pregnancy and Birth Survey was launched to monitor pregnant mothers' health after the Great East Japan Earthquake and Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) accident. Several lines of investigations have indicated that a disaster impacts maternal mental health with childbirth. However, there is no research regarding mental health of mothers with fetal loss after a disaster. In this report, we focus on those women immediately after the Great East Japan Earthquake and Fukushima NPP accident and discuss their support needs.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data regarding 61 miscarriages, 5 abortions, and 22 stillbirths were analyzed among the women who were pregnant at the time of the accident in the present study. We used a two-item case-finding instrument for depression screening, and compared the childbirth group with the fetal loss groups. We also analyzed mothers' opinions written as free-form text.RESULTS: Among the three fetal loss groups, the proportion of positive depression screens was significantly higher in the miscarriage and stillbirth group than in the childbirth group. Mothers' opinions were grouped into six categories, with pregnancy-related items being most common, especially in the miscarriage and stillbirth groups.CONCLUSION: A higher proportion of Fukushima mothers with fetal loss, especially those with miscarriage and stillbirth, had depressive symptoms compared to those who experienced childbirth. Health care providers need to pay close attention to this vulnerable group and respond to their concerns regarding the effects on their fertility.

AB  - In the present study, late term abortions in 477 (17.9%) of 2651 pregnant ewes and 129 of 680 pregnant goats (18.9%) from 17 small ruminant flocks of the South Khorasan province, east of Iran were investigated. Multistage cluster sampling technique was used to select the flocks and aborted animals. From which, 25 appropriate fetuses were chosen for bacterial and fungal contaminations. Blood samples were also taken from forty aborted and forty healthy age matched sheep. No microbial or fungal agents were detected in 45.4 % and 42.8% of sheep and goat,s fetuses respectively. The bacteria isolated from aborted fetuses of sheep and goat's were as follows: Escherichia coli 27.2% and 7.1%, Staphylococcus spp. 9.0% and 7.1%, Campylobacter fetus 9.0% and 14.2%, Staphylococcus spp. and Campylobacter fetus together 9.0% and 0.0 %, Klebsiellas 0.0 % and 21.4%, Aspergillus fumigatus 0.0 % and 7.1%, respectively. The concentrations of total tri-iodothyronine (tT3), total thyroxin (tT4), copper, phosphorus and magnesium were significantly lower, but thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was higher in the aborted ewes compared to the healthy controls. The serum levels of calcium, zinc and vitamin E were not significantly different between the two groups. In conclusion, deficiencies of tT3, tT4, copper, phosphorus and magnesium, and increase in the TSH concentration could have taken part in the etiology of abortion in ewes. The most important cause of late term abortions was probably due to the maternal deficiencies (for example, iodine) in the concurrent drought in the province.

AB  - Aim The Finnish healthcare system will undergo a major reform in the near future. This study examined whether postneonatal childhood mortality differed between university and central hospital districts in Finland from 1985 to 2004 and whether the causes of death were preventable. Methods We analysed postneonatal childhood mortality in Finland during two 10-year periods - 1985 to 1994 and 1995 to 2004 - analysing university and central hospital districts separately, as paediatric intensive care is centralised in university hospitals. The study looked at the main causes of death in each hospital, and the mortality rates were adjusted to demonstrate how many children were at risk of dying. Results Postneonatal childhood mortality decreased during the study period in university and central hospital districts. We found no significant difference in mortality rates between university hospital districts, but regional differences were notable in central hospital districts, partly because of historical differences in mortality. Accidents were the most common cause of death, with substantial regional differences. Conclusion Regional postneonatal childhood mortality differed across central hospital districts, and this should be taken into account in the forthcoming restructuring of the Finnish healthcare system. Special attention is needed to prevent accidental deaths, both nationally and locally. © 2015 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

T2  - International Journal of Endocrinology

VL  - 2015
AB  - Parenthood is a fundamental feature of all known life. However, infertility has been recognized as a public health issue worldwide. But even when the offspring are conceived, in utero problems can lead to immediate (abortion), early (birth), and late (adulthood) consequences. One of the most studied factors is stress. However, stress response is, per se, of adaptive nature allowing the organism to cope with challenges. Stressors lead to deterioration if one is faced with too long lasting, too many, and seemingly unsolvable situations. In stress adaptation the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and the resulting glucocorticoid elevation are one of the most important mechanisms. At cellular level stress can be defined as an unbalance between production of free radicals and antioxidant defenses. Oxidative stress is widely accepted as an important pathogenic mechanism in different diseases including infertility. On the other hand, the goal of free radical production is to protect the cells from infectious entities. This review aims to summarize the negative and positive influence of stress on reproduction as a process leading to healthy progeny. Special emphasis was given to the balance at the level of the organism and cells. © 2015 Dóra Zelena.

AB  - Prenatal stress can affect lifelong physical growth, including increased obesity risk. However, human studies remain limited. Natural disasters provide models of independent stressors unrelated to confounding maternal characteristics. We assessed degree of objective hardship and subjective distress in women pregnant during severe flooding. At ages 2.5 and 4 years we assessed body mass index (BMI), subscapular plus triceps skinfolds (SS + TR, an index of total adiposity), and SS: TR ratio (an index of central adiposity) in their children (n=106). Hierarchical regressions controlled first for several potential confounds. Controlling for these, flood exposure during early gestation predicted greater BMI increase from age 2.5 to 4, as well as total adiposity at 2.5. Greater maternal hardship and distress due to the floods, as well as other nonflood life events during pregnancy, independently predicted greater increase in total adiposity between 2.5 and 4 years. These results support the hypothesis that prenatal stress increases adiposity beginning in childhood and suggest that early gestation is a sensitive period. Results further highlight the additive effects of maternal objective and subjective stress, life events, and depression, emphasizing the importance of continued studies on multiple, detailed measures of maternal mental health and experience in pregnancy and child growth. © 2015 Kelsey N.

AB  - Background: In developing countries, obstetrical hemorrhage is the most common cause of maternal mortality. This disaster is avoided by the urgent blood transfusion and other life saving measures. In countries like Pakistan many health care centers have very limited number of fresh and stored blood in their blood banks which causes lot of inconvenience to the management of bleeding patients. In obstetrical practice, blood transfusion is commonly done in caesarean section. Aim: To order the optimal number of blood units to avoid unnecessary reservation so that blood stock do not get tie down and blood should be available to the deserving patients. Methods: Records of 1468 patients who had emergency and elective caesarean at the Lady Willingdon Hospital Lahore affiliated with king Edward medical university Lahore between 1st January and 30th June 2014 were reviewed data pertaining to age, parity, booking status, type and indication for caesarean section, pre-operative and post-operative packed cell volume, blood loss at surgery, units of blood reserved at blood bank, units of blood transfused and duration of hospital stay was extracted and data was analyzed. Results: There were 3671 deliveries out of which 1468(40%) were by caesarean sections. During this study a total of 725 units of blood were reserved in the blood bank and later on these units of blood were made available to the operation theatre. Only 145(20%) units of blood were transfused to 132 patients amongst those transfused 75(57%) were booked and 99(75%) had primary caesarean section. About 85% of those patients having transfusion had their primary section the most common indication for the transfusion was found to be the placenta previa (39 patients with 95 units of blood) and cephalo-pelvic disproportion(35 patients with 55 units of blood. Conclusion: Although a large number of units blood were reserved and made available to the operation theatre at the time of surgery, most the operated patients did had any transfusion. Establishment of mini blood bank within the obstetrical unit will not only provide timely blood units supply but will also prevent unnecessary wastage of financial resources & blood in central blood bank.

AB  - Fatherhood is a turning point in the life of many men, but for fathers from fragile backgrounds, the birth of a premature child may be the catalyst for a fresh start. This case study details the experience of a young black man from a high-risk background during the pregnancy, birth, and hospitalization of his premature son. Fathers from backgrounds marked by violence and chaos may find the stability they crave in a hospital environment that provides comfort, familial cohesion, and an empowering sense of purpose. Fathers who lack male role models in their lives may benefit from mentoring relationships formed with male nurses in the neonatal intensive care unit. Longstanding neglected needs for available presence and guidance can be met by caring healthcare professionals who take the time to listen to these fathers and share personal experiences.While the struggle to break patterns of the past is complicated by low self-worth, healthcare providers can reinforce a sense of personal value both by providing a specific role for fathers and by engaging them in meaningful conversation. Findings provide valuable information on the lifeworld of black fathers from socially compromised urban neighborhoods and implications for healthcare practitioners working with this population. © © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Background: Knowledge of nasal carriage is important in predicting staphylococcal infection, and no information exists regarding the endemicity of Staphylococcus aureus in Haiti. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of S. aureus nasal screening in an acute care, a subacute rehabilitation, and a community setting, with a brief medical and epidemiological history. PCR-positive S. aureus screening nasal cultures underwent molecular analysis for spa type, SCC. mec type, and virulence genes (Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST), and arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME)), and were evaluated for antibiotic susceptibility using commercial tests. Results: Overall carriage rates of 8.4% methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and 2.8% methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were identified, with a high rate of tetracycline resistance. TSST and PVL genes were identified in MSSA. MRSA isolates contained no virulence markers. Unique MSSA phenotypes (i.e., linezolid-resistant, vancomycin-sensitive/daptomycin non-susceptible) were identified, as were two PVL-positive ST152 MSSA colonization isolates, previously geographically limited to Africa. Conclusions: We found a low S. aureus carriage rate with complete vancomycin susceptibility and high tetracycline resistance, which has important public health implications with regard to treatment. Additionally, the finding of PVL-positive MSSA isolates, including the expansion of a previously described limited 'divergent' clone, ST152, warrants further evaluation. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - NICU patients are among those potentially most vulnerable to the effects of natural or man-made disaster on a medical center. The published data on evacuations of NICU patients in the setting of disaster are sparse. In October of 2012, New York University Langone Medical Center was evacuated during Hurricane Sandy in the setting of a power outage secondary to a coastal surge. In this setting, 21 neonates were safely evacuated from the medical center's NICU to receiving hospitals within New York City in a span of 4.5 hours. Using data recorded during the evacuation and from staff debriefings, we describe the challenges faced and lessons learned during both the power outage and vertical evacuation. From our experience, we identify several elements that are important to the functioning of an NICU in a disaster or to an evacuation that may be incorporated into future NICU-focused disaster planning. These include a clear command structure, backups (personnel, communication, medical information, and equipment), establishing situational awareness, regional coordination, and flexibility as well as special attention to families and to the availability of neonatal transport resources. © © 2014 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - This study explores the correlation between the impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake and the incidence of postpartum depression in Miyagi prefecture, Japan. The design used was a cross-sectional study with self-administered questionnaires, 6–9 months after the disaster. The results showed the prevalence of postnatal women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of ≥9 to be 21.3 %. Multivariate analysis showed that exposure to tsunami (odds ratio, 1.80; 95 % confidence interval, 1.16–2.78) was significantly and independently associated with an EPDS score of ≥9. Postnatal women and their children should be treated as a vulnerable population, and a protective framework must be established to prepare for future devastating disasters. © 2014, The Author(s).

AB  - This book provides a readable introduction to modern toxicology with a particular focus on the mechanisms underlying the induction of toxicity by foreign substances. Since bioactivation is central to many toxic syndromes, special interest is devoted to chemicals that undergo conversion to toxic metabolites that induce toxic effects as diverse as cancer, birth defects and organ injury. The molecular consequences accompanying damage to cellular DNA and proteins is explored together with the relevance of toxicological paradigms to human diseases caused by alcohol and tobacco. The discipline of toxicology has developed rapidly since the thalidomide disaster in the 1960's as scientists worldwide seek to understand the adverse health effects of human medicines, environmental pollutants, consumer chemicals and industrial reagents. An Introduction to Toxicology is intended to supplement the recommended reading list of undergraduate and graduate programs in toxicology and pharmacology as an enjoyable, accessible primer with illustrations that "unpack" the concepts being discussed in the text. © Springer-Verlag London 2014.

AB  - Objective. To identify factors associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) attrition among patients initiating therapy in 2005-2011 at two large, public-sector department-level hospitals, and to inform interventions to improve ART retention. Methods. This retrospective cohort study used data from the iSanté electronic medical record (EMR) system. The study characterized ART attrition levels and explored the patient demographic, clinical, temporal, and service utilization factors associated with ART attrition, using time-to-event analysis methods. Results. Among the 2?023 patients in the study, ART attrition on average was 17.0 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI): 15.8-18.3). In adjusted analyses, risk of ART attrition was up to 89% higher for patients living in distant communes compared to patients living in the same commune as the hospital (hazard ratio: 1.89, 95%CI: 1.54-2.33; P < 0.001). Hospital site, earlier year of ART start, spending less time enrolled in HIV care prior to ART initiation, receiving a non-standard ART regimen, lacking counseling prior to ART initiation, and having a higher body mass index were also associated with attrition risk. Conclusions. The findings suggest quality improvement interventions at the two hospitals, including: enhanced retention support and transportation subsidies for patients accessing care from remote areas; counseling for all patients prior to ART initiation; timely outreach to patients who miss ART pick-ups; "bridging services" for patients transferring care to alternative facilities; routine screening for anticipated interruptions in future ART pick-ups; and medical case review for patients placed on non-standard ART regimens. The findings are also relevant for policymaking on decentralization of ART services in Haiti.

AB  - 147318 pregnancy outcomes were analyzed in Zhytomyrska Oblast during 2000-2010; the descriptive analysis was performed. The frequency of birth defects was estimated among newborns, still-born babies and abortions due to genetic disorders of a fetus on "clean" and polluted territories. There was an increase of all birth defects on the polluted territories; among newborns it was (26.10 ± 0.80) per thousand and (24.23 ± 0.47) per thousand, p < 0.05; among newborns and still-born babies it was (26.54 ± 0.81) per thousand and (24.78 ± 0.48) per thousand, p < 0.06. The increase in the birth defects of the nervous system was detected: among newborns it was (1.09 ± 0.17) per thousand and (0.75 ± 0.08) per thousand, p < 0.05; among newborns and still-born babies it was (1.22 ± 0.18) per thousand and (0.81 ± 0.09) per thousand, p. < 0.05; among newborns, still-born babies and genetically caused abortions it was 2.76 ± 0.26) per thousand and (2.34 ? 0.15) per thousand, p = 0.165. Χ2 criteria confirmed the difference between the frequency of birth defects on "clean" and polluted territories. Estimation by Bayes did not confirm the hypothesis about the difference between the frequency of birth defects on "clean" and polluted territories. Endocrine diseases were confirmed to be an important factor of the origin of birth defects, which is important for planning pregnancy on both polluted and "clean" territories.

AB  - Spatially referenced datasets arising from multiple sources are routinely combined to assess relationships among various outcomes and covariates. The geographical units associated with the data, such as the geographical coordinates or areal-level administrative units, are often spatially misaligned, that is, observed at different locations or aggregated over different geographical units. As a result, the covariate is often predicted at the locations where the response is observed. The method used to align disparate datasets must be accounted for when subsequently modeling the aligned data. Here we consider the case where kriging is used to align datasets in point-to-point and point-to-areal misalignment problems when the response variable is non-normally distributed. If the relationship is modeled using generalized linear models, the additional uncertainty induced from using the kriging mean as a covariate introduces a Berkson error structure. In this article, we develop a pseudo-penalized quasi-likelihood algorithm to account for the additional uncertainty when estimating regression parameters and associated measures of uncertainty. The method is applied to a point-to-point example assessing the relationship between low-birth weights and PM<inf>2.5</inf> levels after the onset of the largest wildfire in Florida history, the Bugaboo scrub fire. A point-to-areal misalignment problem is presented where the relationship between asthma events in Florida's counties and PM<inf>2.5</inf> levels after the onset of the fire is assessed. Finally, the method is evaluated using a simulation study. Our results indicate the method performs well in terms of coverage for 95% confidence intervals and naive methods that ignore the additional uncertainty tend to underestimate the variability associated with parameter estimates. The underestimation is most profound in Poisson regression models. © 2014, The International Biometric Society.

AB  - Increasing urbanization across the globe, combined with an increased use of chemicals in various regions, contributes to several environmental events that influence environmental health. Measures that identify environmental factors and events should be introduced to facilitate epidemiological investigations by health services. The Brazilian Ministry of Health published a new list o f notifiable diseases on 25 January 2011 and introduced environmental events as a new category of notifiable occurrences. The Center for Epidemiologic Surveillance in State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, created an online notification system that highlights "environmental events", such as exposure to chemical contaminants, drinking water with contaminants outside of the recommended range, contaminated air, and natural or anthropogenic disasters. This paper analyzed 300 notifications received between May 2011 and May 2012. It reports the number of notifications with event classifications and analyzes the events relating to accidents with chemical substances. This paper describes the characteristics of the accidents that involved chemical substances, methods used, types of substances, exposed population, and measures adopted. The online notification of environmental events increases the analysis of the main events associated with diseases related to environmental chemicals; thus, it facilitates the adoption of public policies to prevent environmental health problems. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Whereas coronary artery fistulas (CAF) are the most frequent congenital anomalies influencing hemodynamic parameters of coronary arteries, bilateral coronary-pulmonary artery fistula (CPAF) complicated by a large saccular aneurysm is relatively rare. The optimal treatment of symptomatic patients with CPAF and aneurysm still remains a challenging problem and has been usually considered as an indication for cardiac surgery. The transcatheter coil embolization or covered stent for CPAF is a less invasive procedure and has recently been viewed as an alternative to surgical therapy. In this case, we describe a 61-year-old female with a congenital CPAF, originating from the ostium of the right coronary artery and mid segment LAD and draining into the pulmonary trunk and complicated by a large aneurysm presenting with typical angina pectoris. This patient underwent successful transcatheter closure of the right side fistula using a coil embolization technique, which resulted in improved symptoms and signs.

AB  - Transporters are essential in homeostatic exchange of endogenous and exogenous substances at the systematic, organic, cellular, and subcellular levels. Gene mutations of transporters are often related to pharmacogenetics traits. Recent developments in high throughput technologies on genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics allow in depth studies of transporter genes in normal cellular processes and diverse disease conditions. The flood of high throughput data have resulted in urgent need for an updated knowledgebase with curated, organized, and annotated human transporters in an easily accessible way. Using a pipeline with the combination of automated keywords query, sequence similarity search and manual curation on transporters, we collected 1,555 human non-redundant transporter genes to develop the Human Transporter Database (HTD) (http://htd.cbi.pku.edu.cn). Based on the extensive annotations, global properties of the transporter genes were illustrated, such as expression patterns and polymorphisms in relationships with their ligands. We noted that the human transporters were enriched in many fundamental biological processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and cardiac muscle contraction, and significantly associated with Mendelian and complex diseases such as epilepsy and sudden infant death syndrome. Overall, HTD provides a well-organized interface to facilitate research communities to search detailed molecular and genetic information of transporters for development of personalized medicine. © 2014 Ye et al.

AB  - Background: Despite advancements in our understanding of the importance of stress reduction in achieving good health, we still only have limited insight into the impact of stress on cellular function. Recent studies have suggested that exposure to prolonged psychological stress may alter an individual's physiological responses, and contribute to morbidity and mortality. This paper presents an overview of the study protocol we are using to examine the impact of life stressors on lifestyle factors, health-related quality of life and novel and established biomarkers of stress in midlife and older Australian women.The primary aim of this study is to explore the links between chronic psychological stress on both subjective and objective health markers in midlife and older Australian women. The study examines the extent to which exposure frightening, upsetting or stressful events such as natural disasters, illness or death of a relative, miscarriage and relationship conflict is correlated with a variety of objective and subjective health markers. Methods/Design. This study is embedded within the longitudinal Healthy Aging of Women's study which has collected data from midlife and older Australian women at 5 yearly intervals since 2001, and uses the Allostastic model of women's health by Groër and colleagues in 2010. The current study expands the focus of the HOW study and will assess the impact of life stressors on quality of life and clinical biomarkers in midlife and older Australian women to explain the impact of chronic psychological stress in women. Discussion. The proposed study hypothesizes that women are at increased risk of exposure to multiple or repeated stressors, some being unique to women, and the frequency and chronicity of stressors increases women's risk of adverse health outcomes. This study aims to further our understanding of the relationships between stressful life experiences, perceived quality of life, stress biomarkers, chronic illness, and health status in women. © 2014 Seib et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - For many years there has been intense feminist discussion surrounding western discomfort with pregnant and maternal embodiment. Thinking through the complexities of the pregnant subject as a site for interrogating the ethics and aesthetics of disaster, monstrosity and horror, theorists have celebrated how the unstable spatiality and temporality of pregnant embodiment exceeds regulatory and social norms. Arguing against this tendency for abjection, others have deliberately approach the specificity of maternal subjectivity from a position that engages with the generative, surprising and unexpected in order to counteract a discourse they believe is mired in loss, murder and melancholy. However, despite both these positions' proclaimed interest in embodied specificity, very little consideration is given to articulating the phenomenological differences between the pregnant body and the maternal body. More often than not, the pregnant body and the maternal body are seen as interchangeable terms, revealing a narrative that conflates one ontological being with another.Starting from the premise that there is a distinct difference between pregnant and maternal bodies, this article investigates the affective quandary faced when pregnant and maternal norms are ruptured due to pregnancy loss. Performing the catastrophic unspeakableness of my own experience of stillbirth, this paper takes as its subject Taste My Sorrow-my ongoing series of video, performance and sugar-based works that materially folds and refolds grief, anger, shame, tragedy and horror into sensorially complex forms. Performing a visual and textual elegy for a longed-for dead child, this I sample from my experience stillbirth to ethically and aesthetically explore the catastrophic assemblage of becoming maternal loss. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Methyl isocyanate (MIC) is a bitter reminder of the Bhopal disaster in 1984. Bhopal is the capital of the central province Madhya Pradesh, India (estimated population in 1984 was slightly less than 1 million). MIC is extremely toxic to humans from acute (short-term) exposure. It is a colorless liquid with a sharp pungent odor. MIC is prepared industrially by reacting methylamine with phosgene, oxidizing monomethylformamide at high temperatures (>550 °C), or heating metal MICs. MIC is also manufactured from N-methylformamide and air. Because of its high reactivity, MIC is used as an intermediate in organic synthesis, most notably in the production of carbamate-based pesticides. Tobacco smoke from some brands of cigarettes also contains MIC, approximately 4 μg per cigarette. Most of our knowledge on the toxic effects of MIC on humans is derived from the Union Carbide's battery manufacturing plant explosion accident in Bhopal in 1984. Within days of the initial exposure to MIC, thousands died, and additional deaths occurred during the following years. Exposure to MIC contaminated air can cause extreme irritation and difficulty in breathing. Temporary reversible blindness may occur depending on the length of exposure. MIC exposure can lead to development of pulmonary edema, bronchospasm, or electrolyte imbalance. Adverse health effects of MIC can continue for decades in populations exposed to MIC. MIC exposed humans may exhibit lung, ocular, and reproductive effects for years; stillbirths and spontaneous abortions are also very common. EPA has classified methyl isocyanate as a Group D, not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction Even before Hurricane Katrina began to form as a tropical depression over the southeastern Bahamas, New Orleans was a city facing a number of social challenges. The city’s majority Black population was plagued by high poverty rates, high rates of violent crime and high rates of chronic diseases, AIDS and infant mortality, exacerbated by one of the nation’s highest uninsurance rates (Ritea and Young, 2004; Rudowitz, Rowland, and Shartzer, 2006; Webster Jr., and Bishaw, 2006). When the historic port then became the focus of a combination of natural and man-made disaster, its residents became that much more burdened, many uprooted from their homes, some to other dwellings in the city, others gone from the state for good. In the wake of this disaster, the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) determined that one way it could serve the New Orleans community with which it had a long history, as well as the policymakers tasked with leading its recovery, was to apply its survey research expertise to giving a voice and national visibility to residents by reporting what their lives were like in the aftermath of the storm, what they had experienced, what they had lost, and what they needed from recovery efforts. The project turned into a five-year effort which produced four different surveys of the local population, conducted during all three phases of disaster as described in Chapter 6 of this volume (rescue and relief, recovery, and development). The surveys were carried out in conjunction with a team of experts at Social Science Research Solutions, and each was fielded using a different survey methodology, which by default had to evolve along with the changing situation on the ground. This chapter will serve as a case study of this evolving methodology, and what these efforts suggest for interviewing post-disaster populations in the US and internationally. © Cambridge University Press 2014.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate reproductive health of descendants of people who experienced effects of adverse environmental factors, such as radiation and chemical contamination (the descendants themselves were unaffected by these factors). Reproductive health of women was assessed by mathematical modeling. Factors of greatest importance for the health status of the descendants were distinguished among the 76 ones studied. It was shown that reproductive health of the subjects descending from the people exposed to radiation deteriorated more significantly than of those whose ancestors were affected by chemical factors.

AB  - The idea that a mother’s psychological state can negatively influence the outcome of pregnancy and the health of her unborn child has been deeply ingrained into many societies since the beginning of modern civilisation. This concept was revived in the twentieth century when a series of large-scale, manmade and natural disasters, such as war and famine, coupled to population level data, provided an opportunity to examine the effect of stress during pregnancy on the subsequent mental and physical health of the unborn infant. The establishment of the Scandinavian registers, such as those in Sweden and Denmark, has facilitated a closer examination of the effect of antenatal maternal stress on subsequent offspring outcomes at an individual level. There is now a considerable body of work to support the hypothesis that maternal psychological stress in the peri-conception and antenatal period is associated with a diverse range of adverse outcomes for the offspring, including immediate obstetric complications and later psychiatric disorders and chronic physical ill-health. Here we discuss the most recent and robust data emanating from Scandinavian Register-based research programmes and contemporary birth cohorts. We provide evidence that psychological stress is associated with a range of adverse outcomes, which in some cases are gender specific. Moreover, we provide evidence that the timing of exposure is critical and provides tantalising clues into the potential underlying causal pathways. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014

AB  - BACKGROUND: On 11 March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake followed by a powerful tsunami hit the Pacific Coast of Northeast Japan and damaged Tokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, causing a radiation hazard in Fukushima Prefecture. The objective of this report is to describe some results of a questionnaire-based pregnancy and birth survey conducted by the Radiation Medical Science Center for the Fukushima Health Management Survey.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to women who received maternal and child health handbooks from municipal officers in Fukushima Prefecture between 1 August 2010 and 31 July 2011, with the aim of reaching those who were pregnant at the time of the disaster. Mailing began 18 January 2012. Data were analyzed separately for six geographic areas in Fukushima Prefecture.RESULTS: The total number of women meeting survey criteria was 15,972. The number of responses received to date is 9,298 (58.2%). Data from 8602 respondents were analyzed after excluding 634 invalid responses and 5 induced and 57 spontaneous abortions (less than 22 gestational weeks). The incidences of stillbirth (over 22 completed gestational weeks), preterm birth, low birth weight and congenital anomalies were 0.25%, 4.4%, 8.7% and 2.72%, respectively. These incidences are similar to recent averages elsewhere in Japan.CONCLUSION: Considering the pregnancy and birth survey data in aggregate, our disaster seemed to provoke no significant adverse outcomes over the whole of Fukushima prefecture. But post-disaster prenatal care and support intended for patients' safety and security should be coupled with ongoing surveillance and rigorous data analysis.

AB  - To evaluate a forage mitigation strategy, third trimester beef cows were used to determine the effect on subsequent beef cow performance when 28.1% of forage dry matter (DM) was replaced with a nutrient-dense pelleted rumen degradable protein- rumen undegradable protein supplement (RDP -RUP) fed daily (D) or on alternate days (Alt-D).In the 111 day study, one hundred seven,3-10 year old beef cows, were randomized to the following treatments: 1) all hay control group ©, 2) hay and strawforagethat was reduced 28% and replaced with a field pea-barley malt sprout-distillers dried grain with solubles supplement (PEA-BMS-DD GS) fedD at 0.25% of initial body weight(BW) or, 3) hay and straw foragethat was reduced 28% and replaced witha PEA-BMS-DD GS fed on Alt-D at 0.50% of initial BW. Control cows consumed 14.1 kg of hay compared to supplemented cows that consumed 8.10 kg hay, 2.03 kg straw, and 1.37 kg of supplement daily for a total of 11.5 kg. The experimental supplement that was fed supplied 61% RDP and 36% RUP. Reducing hay in the experimental diets and replacing it with wheat straw and the PEA-BMS-DD GS supplement fed either D or on ALT-D did not affect ending cow BW, body condition score, fat thickness, pre-breeding estrous cyclicity, reproductive cycle pregnancy, or the total percent of cows pregnant (P > 0.10). Control and Alt-D calf birth weight was heavier than the D supplemented group (P < 0.01). Calfweaning weight and gain did not differ (P > 0.10). Biologically, there was no difference between C and supplemented cows throughout the study and it was determined that one unit of PEA-BMS-DD GS supplement could replace 2.9 units of forage. On average, and on the basis of 100 cows supplemented for the 111 day period, 15.1 mt of supplement replaced 44.1 mt of forage (P<0.001). Compared to feeding the all hay C diet,the cost of replacing hay with wheat straw and the nutrient-dense PEA-BMS-DD GS supplement was $287.54, $304.44, and $302.43 per cow for the C,D, and ALT-D treatments, respectively. The slightly higher cost for supplementation in the drought mitigation strategy tested wasminiscule compared to selling cows to fit the available forage supply. These data suggest that adequate nutrient supply to the rumen and small intestine can be obtained when feeding a PEA-BMSDD GS on ALT-D and that the dietary strategy can be used to mitigate drought related hay shortages. © 2014 National Centre for Agrarian Sciences.

AB  - The feedback from the staff that participated in the Full Scale Drill was overwhelmingly positive. Working and becoming acquainted with members from other supporting departments is critical to a successful evacuation. They enjoyed being a part of the drill and expressed that having ownership of an evacuation plan is vital in the care of our babies. This turned out to be a remarkable team building exercise on many levels. The planning team achieved its overall goal of creating a sense of control over a potentially chaotic environment and now believes that they could execute an evacuation for any reason with maximum protection for their patients. In a similar way various groups in and outside of the Medical Center have an understanding of the complexities of this patient group and what would be needed to effectively support their needs in a disaster. The NICU/CCN Evacuation Committee looks back over almost a year of hard work with tremendous satisfaction and renewed confidence.

AB  - This study looks at the impact of exposure to natural disasters during pregnancy on the educational outcomes of North Carolina children at the third grade level. A broad literature relates negative birth outcomes to poor educational performance, and a number of recent studies have examined the effect of prenatal exposure to natural disasters on birth outcomes. This study takes the next step by considering how prenatal exposure affects later outcomes. Combining North Carolina administrative data on births and school performance with disaster declarations from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) allows for the identification of children who were exposed to disasters during prenatal development. These children are compared with other children born in the same county who were not exposed to disasters while in utero. Regression results suggest that children exposed to hurricanes prenatally have lower scores on third grade standardized tests in math and reading. Those exposed to flooding or tornadoes also have somewhat lower math scores. Additionally, results suggest that these negative effects are more concentrated among children in disadvantaged subgroups, especially children born to black mothers. However, no evidence exists that these effects are mediated by common measures of birth outcomes, including birth weight and gestational age. © 2014 Population Association of America.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effects of displacement due to flooding during pregnancy on birth outcomes (infant birth weight and gestational age) and the moderating effect of perceived social support on the relationship between displacement and birth outcomes. Design: A descriptive, longitudinal study. Setting: A university-affiliated hospital in Pathum Thani, Thailand. Participants: Pregnant women (N = 175) in the third trimester that had uncomplicated pregnancies and no history of mental illness. Methods: During pregnancy, the participants completed standardized measurements of depression symptoms, perceived social support, and questionnaires concerning the effect of the flood. After giving birth, infant birth weight and gestational age at birth were retrieved from delivery records. Results: Seventy percent (n = 123) of the participants experienced displacement during the flood. The displaced women had a mean infant birth weight of 175 grams less than that of the nondisplaced women, t(173) = -2.38, p = .02, whereas infant gestational age was not different. Displacement and other variables explained approximately 8% of the variance in infant birth weight. The interaction term between displacement and perceived social support was statistically significant and additionally explained the variance in infant birth weight, F(6, 168) = 3.24, p = .005. Conclusion: Being displaced during pregnancy due to a natural disaster affected fetal growth rather than length of gestation. Health care providers should closely monitor maternal weight gain and fetal growth of pregnant women who experience displacement. Among the displaced women, social support was associated with higher infant birth weight; therefore, high levels of perceived social support may be protective for pregnant women who experience stressful events such as displacement from flooding. © 2014 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.

AB  - In 1999, the Ministry of Women's Empowerment in Indonesia worked with advertisers in Jakarta and international technical advisors to develop the concept of 'Suami SIAGA', the 'Alert Husband', confronting Indonesian males with their responsibilities to be aware of their wives' needs and ensure early access if needed to trained obstetrics care. The model was rapidly expanded to apply to the 'Desa SIAGA', the 'Alert Village', with communities assuming the responsibility for awareness of the risks of pregnancy and childbirth, and supporting registered pregnant mothers with funding and transportation for emergency obstetric assistance, and identified blood donors. Based on the participant observation, interviews and documentary analysis, this article uses a systems perspective to trace the evolution of that iconic 'brand' as new national and international actors further developed the concept and its application in provincial and national programmes. In 2010, it underwent a further transformation to become 'Desa Siaga Aktif', a national programme with responsibilities expanded to include the provision of basic health services at village level, and the surveillance of communicable disease, monitoring of lifestyle activities and disaster preparedness, in addition to the management of obstetric emergencies. By tracking the use of this single 'brand', the study provides insights into the complex adaptive system of policy and programme development with its rich interactions between multiple international, national, provincial and sectoral stakeholders, the unpredictable responses to feedback from these actors and their activities and the resultant emergence of new policy elements, new programmes and new levels of operation within the system. © The Author 2013; all rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The majority of research documenting the public health impacts of natural disasters focuses on the well-being of adults and their living children. Negative effects may also occur in the unborn, exposed to disaster stressors when critical organ systems are developing and when the consequences of exposure are large. Methods: We exploit spatial and temporal variation in hurricane behaviour as a quasi-experimental design to assess whether fetal death is dose-responsive in the extent of hurricane damage. Data on births and fetal deaths are merged with Parish-level housing wreckage data. Fetal outcomes are regressed on housing wreckage adjusting for the maternal, fetal, placental and other risk factors. The average causal effect of maternal exposure to hurricane destruction is captured by difference-indifferences analyses. Results: The adjusted odds of fetal death are 1.40 (1.07-1.83) and 2.37 (1.684-3.327) times higher in parishes suffering 10-50% and >50% wreckage to housing stock, respectively. For every 1% increase in the destruction of housing stock, we observe a 1.7% (1.1-2.4%) increase in fetal death. Of the 410 officially recorded fetal deaths in these parishes, between 117 and 205 may be attributable to hurricane destruction and postdisaster disorder. The estimated fetal death toll is 17.4-30.6% of the human death toll. Conclusions: The destruction caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita imposed significant measurable losses in terms of fetal death. Postdisaster migratory dynamics suggest that the reported effects of maternal exposure to hurricane destruction on fetal death may be conservative.

AB  - Natural disasters disproportionately injure women and children. Disaster teams need intensive training in the management of obstetrics and women's healthcare at the disaster site. This article summarizes the obstetrical experience for the International Medical Surgical Response Team (IMSuRT) stationed at Gheskio in Port Au Prince during the first 2 weeks after the 2010 Haitian earthquake. The world's literature on the impact of disasters on women is reviewed. Sixty-three members of the IMSuRT and Disaster Medical Assistance Team set up a mobile surgical field hospital after the 2010 Haitian earthquake. One member (AG) managed all the obstetrical care and taught the other team members essentials of labor management and assessment in pregnancy. Six hundred patients were treated in the first 14 days. Ten percent of these patients were pregnant.There were 12 deliveries. All pregnant patients were evaluated by a Sonosite ultrasound device. Pregnant patients with earthquake-related injuries were treated for their injuries.Women in labor were managed by active management in labor. No cesarean sections were needed. Well-being of mother and babies. Sixty pregnant women presented to the mobile hospital for evaluation from January 17, 2010, through January 28, 2012. Twelve women in labor delivered healthy infants by vaginal delivery. Gestational ages ranges from 34 to 40 weeks. Active management of labor included the use of intravenous Pitocin, which was titrated to contractions. Duration of labor ranged from 2 to 12 hours. Three team members participated in each delivery. Two women were discharged on the same day as their deliveries. Eight women were discharged on the first postpartum day and two on the second postpartum day. Pregnant women suffered severe injuries. Additionally, pregnant women with pre-existing medical conditions were treated after the earthquake. Active management of labor allowed all women to deliver vaginally. The labor management required tremendous team resources to facilitate vaginal deliveries and avoid cesarean sections. Cesarean sections in an austere environment have the potential for devastating consequences such as sepsis, wound dehiscence, and the long-term risks of uterine rupture with subsequent pregnancies. Our experience highlights the need to include trained obstetrical providers on the first response team. Data from this article were included in the presentation, "An urgent need for women's health specialists in disaster response," at the Disaster Response Workshop, Annual Meeting Society Maternal Fetal Medicine, Dallas, 2012.

AB  - Background: Previous studies link maternal blood lead (Pb) levels and pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders. Objective: Assess the relationship between neighborhood soil Pb and maternal eclampsia risk. Methods: Zip code summarized high density soil survey data of New Orleans collected before and after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (HKR) were merged with pregnancy outcome data on 75,501 mothers from the Louisiana office of public health. Cross-sectional logistic regression analyses are performed testing the association between pre-HKR accumulation of Pb in soils in thirty-two neighborhoods and eclampsia risk. Then we examine whether measured declines in soil Pb following the flooding of the city resulted in corresponding reductions of eclampsia risk. Results: Cross-sectional analyses show that a one standard deviation increase in soil Pb increases the odds of eclampsia by a factor of 1.48 (95% CI: 1.31, 1.66). Mothers in zip code areas with soil Pb>333. mg/kg were 4.00 (95% CI: 3.00, 5.35) times more likely to experience eclampsia than mothers residing in neighborhoods with soil Pb<50. mg/kg. Difference-in-differences analyses capturing the exogenous reduction in soil Pb following the 2005 flooding of New Orleans indicate that mothers residing in zip codes experiencing decrease in soil Pb (-387.9 to -33.6. mg/kg) experienced a significant decline in eclampsia risk (OR=0.619; 95% CI: 0.397, 0.963). Conclusions: Mothers residing in neighborhoods with high accumulation of Pb in soils are at heightened risk of experiencing eclampsia. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Disasters have serious long-term impact on mental health for those exposed. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of postpartum depression among survivors of the 1988 devastating earthquake in Armenia. A nested case-control design was applied to investigate postpartum depression in a large-scale cohort of survivors followed between 1990 and 2012. From an original group of 725 adults who were assessed for psychopathology in 1990, 146 women reported having a delivery after the earthquake and were included in this study. Women with postpartum depression were identified using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. A logistic regression model was fitted to identify the predictors of postpartum depression. Of the 146 women, 19 (13.0 %) had postpartum depression. Five independent predictors of postpartum depression were identified: number of woman's stressful life events (odds ratio (OR)=2.06), her prior history of postpartum depression (OR=16.98), delivering sick/dead neonate (OR=13.65), poor living standards during the post-earthquake decade (OR=5.77), and perceiving oneself reliable in 1990 (OR=0.24). Anxiety in 1990 was marginally significantly related to the outcome (OR=3.75). The rate of postpartum depression in this 22-year cohort was similar to that among the Armenian general population. Earthquake exposure was not related to postpartum depression, indicating that the impact of disaster-related trauma diminishes over time. The identified predictors provided evidence to develop interventions targeting groups of women most prone to postpartum depression under such circumstances. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Pakistan has third highest burden of maternal and children mortality across the globe. This grim situation is further intensified by flaws of planning and implementation set forth in health sector. Natural calamities (earth quakes, floods), disease outbreaks and lack of awareness in different regions of country also further aggravate this situation. Despite of all these limitations, under the banner of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) a special focus and progress in addressing maternal health issue (set as goal 5) has been made over the last decade. In this review, improvement and short falls pertaining to Goal 5 Improve maternal health have been analyzed in relation to earlier years. A decline in maternal mortality ratio (MMR) (490 maternal deaths in 1990 to 260 maternal deaths per 100,000 women in 2010) is observed. Reduction in MMR by three quarters was not achieved but a decline from very high mortality to high mortality index was observed. Increase usage of contraceptives (with contraceptive prevalence rate of 11.8 in 1990 to 37 in 2013) also shed light on women awareness about their health and social issues. Based on progress level assessment (WHO guidelines),access of Pakistani women to universal reproductive health unit falls in moderate category in 2010 as compared to earlier low access in 1990. From the data it looks that still a lot of effort is required for achieving the said targets. However, keeping in view all challenges, Pakistan suffered in the said duration, like volatile peace, regional political instability, policy implementation constrains, population growth, this slow but progressive trend highlight a national resilience to address the havoc challenge of maternal health.These understandings and sustained efforts will significantly contribute a best possible accomplishment in Millennium Development Goal 5 by 2015.

AB  - Background: Several studies have shown a higher risk of psychological problems in health care workers exposed to serious occupational stressors. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to assess the presence of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and possible risk factors in a sample of 32 workers who were at the same time rescuers and victims of a fire that broke out in the neonatal intensive care unit of a large paediatric hospital.Methods: Immediately and six months after the event, the subjects underwent a study protocol aimed at the diagnostic assessment of PTSD, investigated via the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Results: Out of the 30 subjects examined (two were missing), six showed the diagnostic criteria for a current PTSD. Risk factors for PTSD onset were a prior psychiatric disorder, the level of involvement in the fire disaster and the presence of phobias in the days immediately after the event. Gender and level of education approached statistical significance. Conclusions: The high prevalence of PTSD found in this sample was due to the fact that the risk of death or serious injury involved infants.

AB  - This paper conducts an analysis of the socioeconomic determinants of Vietnam's cross-provincial variations in natural disaster vulnerability. The purpose is twofold: (i) to capture disaggregated vulnerability variations normally obscured by national statistics, thereby providing more nuanced insights into Vietnam's vulnerability to natural disasters; and (ii) to take advantage of the fact that the overall political system and key institutional structures to a large extent are constant across Vietnam's provinces, which makes the analysis a novel addition to the many disaster studies based on cross-national variations. The paper's analysis indicates that much of Vietnam's cross-provincial variations in natural disaster fatalities and economic costs can be explained by differences in key socioeconomic factors. High provincial rates of inequality, poverty and infant mortality, for instance, appear to drive up natural disaster fatalities. Local adaptation efforts should focus as much on these broader socioeconomic dimensions as they focus on the geophysical susceptibility to natural hazards of individual areas. © 2014 Victoria University of Wellington and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - This study sought to predict posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from women's reproductive health events after an earthquake experience. Data on antenatal care, pregnancy outcomes, family planning, socioeconomic status, earthquake experiences, and mental health were collected from a random sample of 425 women of reproductive age using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Reproductive Health Assessment Toolkit and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis to predict PTSD symptoms from posttrauma care variables and reproductive health events. Restricted social participation, use of temporary accommodation, pregnancy complications, and use of injectable contraceptives were significant risk factors of PTSD. These factors may be exacerbated by the social context of conservative societies, traditions about health care-seeking behavior, and access to health care. Antecedent reproductive health events influence women's reaction to major trauma including events such as an earthquake. Copyright © 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - SUMMARY: Acute hepatitis E is a very common disease in developing countries, to the point that, according to World Health Organization estimates, one third of the world's population has been exposed to HEV. It also causes outbreaks in refugee camps or after natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes. Sporadic cases of acute hepatitis have been observed in practically all European countries and other developed geographical areas, not only in travelers from endemic countries but also in people with no risk factors. But, lately, new aspects of this infection are appearing in industrialized countries such as the possibility of the disease becoming chronic in transplant patients, the immunocompromised in general, and even in patients with previous liver disease who are immunocompetent. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the current knowledge on HEV infection. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The authors' survey of the Ganga-Meghna-Brahmaputra (GMB) plain (area 569,749 km2; population >500 million) over the past 20 years and analysis of more than 220,000 hand tube-well water samples revealed groundwater arsenic contamination in the floodplains of the Ganga-Brahmaputra river (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Assam) in India and the Padma-Meghna-Brahmaputra river in Bangladesh. On average, 50 % of the water samples contain arsenic above the World Health Organization guideline value of 10 μg/L in India and Bangladesh. More than 100 million people in the GMB plain are potentially at risk. The authors' medical team screened around 155,000 people from the affected villages and registered 16,000 patients with different types of arsenical skin lesions. Arsenic neuropathy and adverse pregnancy outcomes have been recorded. Infants and children drinking arsenic-contaminated water are believed to be at high risk. About 45,000 biological samples analyzed from arsenic-affected villages of the GMB plain revealed an elevated level of arsenic present in patients as well as non-patients, indicating that many are sub-clinically affected. In West Bengal and Bangladesh, there are huge surface water in rivers, wetlands, and flooded river basins. In the arsenic-affected GMB plain, the crisis is not over water scarcity but about managing the available water resources. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Background On May 12, 2008, a powerful 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck China's Sichuan province. While some studies have assessed the mental and physical wellbeing of disaster victims, few have examined the long-term impact of natural disasters on pregnant women's mental health. As such, this study aims to assess whether the Sichuan earthquake continues to negatively affect women's mental health, 4 years since its occurrence. In addition, predictive and protective risk factors of depressive symptoms among pregnant women were also identified. Methods From June 2012 to October 2012, 520 pregnant women were interviewed, of whom 253 were from an earthquake struck area and 267 were from a non-earthquake struck area. Symptoms of antenatal depression were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) with a cutoff of≥10. Results The prevalence rate of depression among pregnant women in the earthquake area was 34.5% (95% CI, 28.9-40.6), while the rate in the non-earthquake area was 39.6% (95% CI, 33.9-45.5). The perceived stresses associated with pregnancy and social support from husbands are significantly correlated with antenatal depression. Limitations: Lack of diagnosis for antenatal depression and it is a self-report evaluation. Conclusions This study found that the Sichuan earthquake does not necessarily have a long-lasting effect on pregnant women who were once victims of the disaster. It was found that pregnant women who experience high levels of pressures from the pregnancy and receive medium support from husbands are more susceptible to experience antenatal depression than pregnant women who perceive higher levels of support from husbands. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The ratio of male to female offspring at birth may be a simple and non-invasive way to monitor the reproductive health of a population. Except in societies where selective abortion skews the sex ratio, approximately 105 boys are born for every 100 girls. Generally, the human sex ratio at birth is remarkably constant in large populations. After the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in April 1986, a long lasting significant elevation in the sex ratio has been found in Russia, i.e. more boys or fewer girls compared to expectation were born. Recently, also for Cuba an escalated sex ratio from 1987 onward has been documented and discussed in the scientific literature. Presentation of the hypothesis. By the end of the eighties of the last century in Cuba as much as about 60% of the food imports were provided by the former Soviet Union. Due to its difficult economic situation, Cuba had neither the necessary insight nor the political strength to circumvent the detrimental genetic effects of imported radioactively contaminated foodstuffs after Chernobyl. We propose that the long term stable sex ratio increase in Cuba is essentially due to ionizing radiation. Testing of the hypothesis. A synoptic trend analysis of Russian and Cuban annual sex ratios discloses upward jumps in 1987. The estimated jump height from 1986 to 1987 in Russia measures 0.51% with a 95% confidence interval (0.28, 0.75), p value < 0.0001. In Cuba the estimated jump height measures 2.99% (2.39, 3.60), p value < 0.0001. The hypothesis may be tested by reconstruction of imports from the world markets to Cuba and by radiological analyses of remains in Cuba for Cs-137 and Sr-90. Implications of the hypothesis. If the evidence for the hypothesis is strengthened, there is potential to learn about genetic radiation risks and to prevent similar effects in present and future exposure situations. © 2013 Scherb et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - This report assesses the commendable progress made in maternal and child mortality reductions in Haiti prior to the January 2010 earthquake. Suggested measures that the Haitian government and international donor community can take to maintain these gains are also made. With the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) deadline of 2015 drawing nearer, the likelihood that Haiti will achieve MDG's 4 and 5 of reducing child and maternal mortality by two-thirds and three-quarters, respectively, by the end of this target year, remain questionable. In particular, the destruction inflicted on the country's health care system and health infrastructure by the 2010 earthquake have already resulted in a slowing of these gains and could potentially threaten an actual reversal of these trends. The country's Soins Obstétricaux Gratuits and Soins Infantiles Gratuits schemes established in 2008 and 2010, which provide free health care to women, newborns and children under 5, represent examples of measures that will need to be sustained and scaled up if the country is to meet its MDG 4 and 5 targets. The Haitian government's endorsement of an increased continuum of care approach to maternal and newborn health will also be vital for future initiatives. Post-quake public health and social service reconstruction efforts will need to incorporate maternal and child health-friendly services into their designs. It also remains critical that international donors continue to meet their pledges to Haiti. The Haitian government should also take more strides to clearly delineate the maternal and child health interventions it implements, both in order to facilitate greater national learning, as well as to improve the likelihood of future replication. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This full-color book provides a compendium of stimulating facts about the states, presented graphically, and covering a wide array of topics including demographic, economic, environmental, health, and crime variables. Hundreds of attributes are compared side-by-side, from life expectancy to murder rates; from fourth-grade math proficiency scores to the number of food stamp recipients, and from illicit drug use to the rate of firearm background checks per state. Through meticulous organization and use of graphic formats, retrieval of specific information the reader may seek has been greatly facilitated. In addition to the graphs comparing the fifty states for each individual metric, a summary table is provided at the beginning of each chapter along with highlights of pertinent data found in the chapter. While we are one, indivisible nation, at the same time Americans are as diverse from state-to-state as many nations are when compared with other nations. For example: in 2010, 95 percent of Vermont residents were white compared with only 24 percent of residents in Hawaii and 1-in-12 New York residents were Jewish compared with less than 1-in-1,000 Arkansas residents. In Texas, 464 prisoners have been executed over the past 35 years while 16 states have not executed any. More interesting facts found in ranking America's Fifty States include: Alaska ranked highest or lowest in 31 metrics-more than any other state-followed by Mississippi at 25 and Texas at 20. Alaska is the only state that does not have a state income tax or a state sales tax. It had the highest revenues per capita from taxes levied on businesses for the extraction of oil and gas and receives the highest federal aid per capita. Alaska had the lowest percent of households with annual income below $15,000. Over the past decade, over 100 million firearms background checks have been performed nationally, with the highest rate in Utah and the lowest rate in New Jersey. Mississippi had the lowest personal income per capita, median household income, gross domestic product per capita, and lowest male life expectancy rate. Additionally, it had the highest food stamp recipient rate, rate of persons below the poverty level, and infant mortality rate. Florida had the highest rate of identity theft victims in 2010 followed by Arizona, California, and Georgia. Texas had the most extreme environmental metrics including the highest major disaster, storm, and wildfire emergency declarations. Texas also had the highest summer air temperature and carbon dioxide emissions level. In addition to extreme environmental metrics, Texas also had the highest property crime rate and high school dropout rate. © 2013 by Bernan Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous studies show that shorter gestation, lower birth-weight and fewer male births can result from maternal exposure to environmental disasters. We examined the 2009 Black Saturday fires in Victoria, Australia using a population cohort method. This study principally finds small but significant increases in pre-term birth (p=0.04) and decreases in birth-weight (p=0.001) in infants whose mothers were exposed to the fires late in the second trimester or during the third trimester. Because environmental disasters are an increasing threat and poor birth outcomes can have detrimental effects across the lifespan, understanding the relationship between environmental disasters and birth outcomes is important for future disaster policy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Midwives for Haiti is an organization that focuses on the education and training of skilled birth attendants in Haiti, a country with a high rate of maternal and infant mortality and where only 26% of births are attended by skilled health workers. Following the 2010 earthquake, Midwives for Haiti received requests to expand services and numerous professional midwives answered the call to volunteer. This author was one of those volunteers. The purpose of the study was: 1) to develop a description of the program's strengths and its deficits in order to determine if there was a need to improve the preparation of volunteers prior to service and 2) to make recommendations aimed at strengthening the volunteers' contributions to the education of Haiti and auxiliary midwives. Methods: Three distinct but closely related questionnaires were developed to survey Haitian students, staff midwives, and volunteers who served with Midwives for Haiti. Questions were designed to elicit information about how well the volunteers were prepared for their experience, the effectiveness of translation services, and suggestions for improving the preparation of volunteers and strengthening the education program. Results: Analysis of the surveys of volunteers, staff, midwives, and the Haitian students generated several common themes. The 3 groups agreed that the volunteers made an effective contribution to the program of education and that the volunteer midwives need more preparation prior to serving in Haiti. The 3 groups also agreed on the need for better translators and recommended more structure to the education program. Discussion: The results of this study are significant to international health care organizations that use volunteer health care professionals to provide services. The results support a growing body of knowledge that international health aid organizations may use to strengthen the preparation, support, and effectiveness of volunteer health providers. © 2013 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

AB  - An agrarian structure predominated by small and marginal farmers; and repeated natural calamities like droughts, floods and cyclones and poor infrastructural development in the hilly terrain of western and southern Odisha have an adverse effect on the health status of the people of Odisha. As a result of which the birth rate, death rate, infant mortality rate, life expectancy rate, maternal mortality ratio, total fertility ratio, etc., of Odisha lags behind the national average. To improve the prevailing situation, the Government of Odisha launched the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) programme in the state on 17 June 2005. The NRHM has completed six years in Odisha. It becomes necessary to assess the impact of the NRHM on the health indicators, to know how the schemes under NRHM are working in Odisha and to assess the transition in the health status of Odisha. Both primary and secondary data are used for the analysis of data. Primary data was collected through personal interviews. Multiple Regression Analysis was used to know how the State Government Capital Expenditure (SGCE) and State Government Revenue Expenditure (SGRE) on health and family welfare have influenced the health indicators like infant mortality rate, birth rate, death rate, etc. © 2013 Indian Institute of Health Management Research.

AB  - Problem The 2010 earthquake in Haiti displaced about 1.5 million people, many of them into camps for internally displaced persons. It was expected that disruption of breastfeeding practices would lead to increased infant morbidity, malnutrition and mortality. Approach Haiti's health ministry and the United Nations Children's Fund, in collaboration with local and international nongovernmental organizations, established baby tents in the areas affected by the earthquake. The tents provided a safe place for mothers to breastfeed and for non-breastfed infants to receive ready-to-use infant formula. Such a large and coordinated baby tent response in an emergency context had never been mounted before anywhere in the world. Local setting Baby tents were set up in five cities but mainly in Port-au-Prince, where the majority of Haiti's 1555 camps for displaced persons had been established. Relevant changes Between February 2010 and June 2012, 193 baby tents were set up; 180 499 mother-infant pairs and 52 503 pregnant women were registered in the baby tent programme. Of infants younger than 6 months, 70% were reported to be exclusively breastfed and 10% of the "mixed feeders" moved to exclusive breastfeeding while enrolled. In 2010, 13.5% of registered infants could not be breastfed. These infants received ready-to-use infant formula. Lessons learnt Thanks to rapid programme scale-up, breastfeeding practices remained undisrupted. However, better evaluation methods and comprehensive guidance on the implementation and monitoring of baby tents are needed for future emergencies, along with a clear strategy for transitioning baby tent activities into facility and community programmes.

Study design: The New York State Vital Statistics and Congenital Malformations Registry data (1992 - 2001) were analyzed for five Hudson Valley counties in a 20-mile radius from the Indian Point nuclear reactor (Buchanan, NY, USA). Four zones of 5-mile increments were used to categorize proximity to the reactor. Data included congenital anomalies, low birth weight, and prematurity. Result: Over the 10-year period, 702 malformations in 666 children were identified from a birth population of 328,124, yielding a regional rate of 2.1 major malformations per 1000 births. The prevalence of defects, low birth weight, and prematurity were not related to proximity to the nuclear power plant. Conclusion: These data did not substantiate an association between maternal proximity to the reactor and certain birth defects and provide baseline data for comparison in the event of a nuclear accident. © 2013 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

AB  - Objectives: Controversy remains over whether declines in male births reported after population stressors result from either or both reduced conception of males or increased selection in utero against male fetuses. We use monthly birth cohorts to determine if Japanese male births following the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 fell below levels expected from female births and from history (i.e., autocorrelation) among cohorts exposed to the Earthquake at or after conception. Methods: We apply interrupted time-series methods to 69 months (i.e., April, 2006 through December, 2011) of birth data from the most and least affected prefectures as well as from the remainder of Japan. We estimate expected male births from female births and from autocorrelation. Results: Findings varied by distance from the greatest damage but suggest sensitive periods both early and late in gestation when population stressors may induce selection against males in utero. Support for reduced conception of males appeared only in the prefectures most damaged by the Earthquake. Conclusions: Results align with the claim that natural selection has conserved mechanisms that reduce the odds of a male live birth during stressful times by reducing the conception of males and by increasing the rate of spontaneous abortion among male fetuses.

AB  - We examined methodological issues in studies of disaster-related effects on reproductive health outcomes and fertility among women of reproductive age and infants in the United States (US). We conducted a systematic literature review of 1,635 articles and reports published in peer-reviewed journals or by the government from January 1981 through December 2010. We classified the studies using three exposure types: (1) physical exposure to toxicants; (2) psychological trauma; and (3) general exposure to disaster. Fifteen articles met our inclusion criteria concerning research focus and design. Overall studies pertained to eight different disasters, with most (n = 6) focused on the World Trade Center attack. Only one study examined pregnancy loss, i.e., occurrence of spontaneous abortions post-disaster. Most studies focused on associations between disaster and adverse birth outcomes, but two studies pertained only to post-disaster fertility while another two examined it in addition to adverse birth outcomes. In most studies disaster-affected populations were assumed to have experienced psychological trauma, but exposure to trauma was measured in only four studies. Furthermore, effects of both physical exposure to toxicants and psychological trauma on disaster-affected populations were examined in only one study. Effects on birth outcomes were not consistently demonstrated, and study methodologies varied widely. Even so, these studies suggest an association between disasters and reproductive health and highlight the need for further studies to clarify associations. We postulate that post-disaster surveillance among pregnant women could improve our understanding of effects of disaster on the reproductive health of US pregnant women. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).

AB  - Biotechnological discoveries and inventions have been observed to improve food production qualitatively as well as quantitatively. In certain specific cases, the improvement in the quality and nutrition of foods by altering their composition were also monitored. However, the practice of biotechnology has also upraised concerns about its potential risks to the environment as well as human being. Genetic Engineering provides resources to host genes into plants via mechanisms, different in some respects from classical breeding. A number of genetically engineered variety of foods have been developed, which have become important nutraceuticals; most notably canola, cotton, maize and soybean, were developed employing this modern technology, and at present the traits introduced are herbicide and/or pest tolerance. Gene technology leads to increase the production in plants, as well as the elevation of resistance to pests, viruses, frost, etc. Gene transfer technology is employed to alter the physical and chemical composition with nutraceutical worth. The present review article is the compilation of various physiological and biochemical studies reflecting both positive and negative ecological concerns of genetically modified foods. © Mishra and Singh; Licensee Bentham Open.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization recommends that newborn infants be breastfed within the first hour of life, a practice that improves infant health and reduces neonatal mortality. The objectives of this study were to report the rate of breastfeeding initiation within 1 hour of birth in Jiangyou, China, to determine its impact on "full breastfeeding" at discharge, and to investigate factors associated with early breastfeeding initiation. Methods: A prospective cohort study of infant feeding practices was undertaken during 2010 and 2011 in Jiangyou, 2 years after an earthquake caused extensive damage. A total of 695 mothers were recruited from hospitals and health centers and interviewed at discharge. Results: In this study, 9.1 percent of women began breastfeeding within 1 hour postpartum. Mothers who initiated breastfeeding early were more likely to be fully breastfeeding at discharge (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.23-3.60). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that giving birth at a health center was associated with delayed breastfeeding initiation (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.04-0.32), whereas attending antenatal classes (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.36-4.87) and receiving encouragement from hospital staff to initiate breastfeeding (OR 5.60, 95% CI 2.31-13.55) were correlated with putting the baby to the breast soon after delivery. Conclusions: Early breastfeeding initiation rate was low and the use of prelacteal foods was widespread in Jiangyou. Early breastfeeding initiation was associated with higher "full breastfeeding" rates at discharge. It is important to educate doctors and nurses to assist mothers with early breastfeeding initiation and to discourage the use of non-breastmilk prelacteal feeds.

AB  - Past research provides evidence for trajectories of health and wellness among individuals following disasters that follow specific pathways of resilience, resistance, recovery, or continued dysfunction. These individual responses are influenced by event type and pre-event capacities. This study was designed to utilize the trajectories of health model to determine if it translates to population health. We identified terrorist attacks that could potentially impact population health rather than only selected individuals within the areas of the attacks. We chose to examine a time series of population birth outcomes before and after the terrorist events of the New York City (NYC) World Trade Center (WTC) attacks of 2001 and the Madrid, Spain train bombings of 2004 to determine if the events affected maternal-child health of those cities and, if so, for how long. For percentages of low birth weight (LBW) and preterm births, we found no significant effects from the WTC attacks in NYC and transient but significant effects on rates of LBW and preterm births following the bombings in Madrid. We did find a significant positive and sustained effect on infant mortality rate in NYC following the WTC attacks but no similar effect in Madrid. There were no effects on any of the indicator variables in the comparison regions of New York state and the remainder of Spain. Thus, population maternal-health in New York and Madrid showed unique adverse effects after the terrorist attacks in those cities. Short-term effects on LBW and preterm birth rates in Madrid and long-term effects on infant mortality rates in NYC were found when quarterly data were analyzed from 1990 through 2008/2009. These findings raise questions about chronic changes in the population's quality of life following catastrophic terrorist attacks. Public health should be monitored and interventions designed to address chronic stress, environmental, and socioeconomic threats beyond the acute aftermath of events. © 2012 The New York Academy of Medicine.

AB  - Aim To describe how recipients of portable sleeping spaces (PSSs) for babies received and used these devices, offered as emergency baby beds in earthquake-ravaged Christchurch, New Zealand, 2011. Method The PSS package responded to increased risk to babies from disrupted living and sleeping conditions in families. 'Door-to-door' distribution offered easy access to those in need. A subgroup of recipients gave feedback via a survey. Results From 642 families who received PSSs between March and August, 139 were invited to complete a survey on usage and 100 (72%) responded. Risks identified were 'earthquake related' (82%), bed-sharing (41%), smoking in pregnancy (26%) and prematurity or low birthweight (11%). PSSs were used for same-bed co-sleeping by 87%. They were used even though most families (96%) also had a cot or bassinet. Features most appreciated were 'having baby close' (90%), 'peace of mind' (88%) and portability (74%). Conclusion PSSs were acceptable to parents and used as instructed. Enabling physical protection of babies when same-bed co-sleeping, they gave peace of mind to parents. PSSs could be considered in ordinary times for protecting babies from sudden infant death. © 2013 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (Royal Australasian College of Physicians).

AB  - A growing literature suggests that stressful events in pregnancy can have negative effects on birth outcomes. Some of the estimates in this literature may be affected by small samples, omitted variables, endogenous mobility in response to disasters, and errors in the measurement of gestation, as well as by a mechanical correlation between longer gestation and the probability of having been exposed. We use millions of individual birth records to examine the effects of exposure to hurricanes during pregnancy, and the sensitivity of the estimates to these econometric problems. We find that exposure to a hurricane during pregnancy increases the probability of abnormal conditions of the newborn such as being on a ventilator more than 30. min and meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Although we are able to reproduce previous estimates of effects on birth weight and gestation, our results suggest that measured effects of stressful events on these outcomes are sensitive to specification and it is preferable to use more sensitive indicators of newborn health. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - In July 2010, Pakistan suffered nationwide floods after unprecedented monsoon rains overwhelmed the Indus basin. The ensuing floods claimed 1985 lives, injured 2946 people and affected over 20.2 million people. Seventy-eight out of 121 districts were affected and at one stage one-fifth of the country's land was inundated with water. Indiscriminate damage was caused to housing, educational and health facilities, communication networks, power plants and grids, irrigation channels, agricultural land and livestock. Over 37 million medical consultations were reported within one year of the floods with acute respiratory infection, skin diseases, acute diarrhoea and suspected malaria forming the most common presentations. Rescue and relief operations were organised through the National Disaster Management Authority and a UN Cluster Approach was adopted for providing humanitarian assistance. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) played a pivotal role in coordinating relief efforts between cluster groups and providing communication platforms for identifying gaps and sharing information. This paper attempts to collate information available in the public domain into a summary report based on key principles described by Kulling et al. (2010) on health crisis reporting.

AB  - Background In order to evaluate the effect of long-term intrauterine device (IUD) use on female fertility, we interviewed 2301 women who lost children in the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China, which prompted IUD removal. Study Design A clinical retrospective survey. Result Five hundred and twenty-four women were lost to follow-up, and data from the remaining 1770 women were analyzed. The completed questionnaires revealed that 80.11% (1418/1770) became pregnant following IUD removal and about 88% (1256) of whom conceived within 1 year. Among women with different durations of IUD use, pregnancy rates and miscarriage rates were as follows: < 5 years, 89.77% and 4.27%; 6-10 years, 81.10% and 10.19%; and > 10 years, 75.20% and 12.98%, respectively. Age, duration of IUD use, a history of a previous miscarriage and abnormal menstruation before the earthquake were independently associated with reduced fertility, but a higher gravidity pre-earthquake was associated with a higher conception rate. Conclusion Long-term IUD use in older women had a high rate of pregnancy after removal of IUD, but with an increased risk of fertility problems. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Bhopal Gas leak was a first of its kind in the history of India. It is a tragedy which needs to be looked time and again so that process safety is never undermined ever at any stage in future in the entire globe. The tragedy had many dimensions. One important parameter was medical though others were also significant. The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) organized multiple clinical research studies on the affected population. The massive figure of mortality includes approximately 5,000 children who died instantly and several hundred thousand disabled for life, including born with defects arising from the disaster. The chronology of the Bhopal incident is measured in calendars as it traces a series of connected developments that span years. So here is our attempt to revisit Bhopal and pick out some points to reestablish and restate that safety is not a company's duty it should be a part of its executing lifestyle.

AB  - Investigation and analysis on 2008. 5. 12 Wenchuan earthquake damages shows that some major security hidden trouble problems for projects will leave out because of misjudging large earthquake by means of taking investigation based on active faults and historical earthquakes as the key evaluation method for engineering regional tectonic stability. Taking Longmenshan active nappe as an example, based on the research results on the crustal rock mass structure, new tectonic activities, historical earthquakes, using rock mass structure cybernetics, Byerlee' law, mechanics characteristics of the Longmenshan crustal rock mass, the relationship between the shearing-slip strength of the controlling-seismic structural layer and earthquake magnitude, the relationship between earthquake magnitude and the seismic fortification intensity are quantitatively studied, the key problems to assess the regional tectonic stability are discussed. The main result is that the detachment layer within nappe boundary zone plays a main control role which is called a control shock layer. There is significant correlation among the earthquake magnitude, buried depth of the detachment layer and shear strength, namely, 8 earthquake focal depth close to 20 km, 7 earthquake focal depth close to 14 km, 6 earthquake focal depth near 10 km. Based on depth of ancient earthquakes ratified, possible scope of 6 above earthquakes and corresponding seismic fortification intensity are delineated in Longmenshan nappe-Minshan block and adjacent area. The result makes up drawbacks of the previous evaluation method based on the relation among active fault, seismogenic fault, historical maximum magnitude and corresponding seismic intensity, in which such problems as oversight of historical earthquakes, limit of scope and depth of fault zone and ignore the essence of rock mass mechanics in regional tectonic stability for proposed construction project lead to miscarriage of justice and leakage evaluation.

AB  - Reproductive health (RH) has historically received low priority in the hierarchy of humanitarian response. Awareness of RH needs in emergencies began in the mid-1990s and led to the formation of the Inter-Agency Working Group (IAWG) for RH. Subsequently, the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP), a set of guidelines for RH service delivery in crisis settings, was created. The objectives of the MISP are to facilitate the coordination of RH services, prevent and manage the consequences of sexual violence, reduce HIV transmission, minimize maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, and plan for comprehensive RH services in the post-crisis phase. Available documentation on MISP implementation is minimal, and reveals mixed success. Challenges include low MISP awareness, inadequate RH training among humanitarian actors, logistical difficulties and poor coordination. Continued emphasis on advocacy and capacity building, a stronger focus on logistics and coordination and a greater commitment to monitoring and evaluation are essential for improving the MISP's effectiveness in the field. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The secondary sex ratio (SSR) has been suggested to decrease with adverse physical and psychological environments. Previous studies have focused on reduced SSR under adverse conditions, such as war, terrorism attack and earthquake, but few studies have investigated fluctuations in SSR in moderately adverse environments. This study analysed municipality-level vital statistics records in Japan collected between 1998 and 2002 to identify high-SSR clusters and low-SSR clusters with spatial-scan statistics. In 999 runs of simulation, high- and low-SSR clusters were detected but fewer than 950 times, indicating that SSR was not geographically clustered in Japan if type I error of 5% was adopted. Explorative analyses comparing demographic attributes between high-SSR clusters and low-SSR clusters that were detected more than 500 times in 999 runs of simulation, showed that rate of spontaneous abortion, rate of artificial abortion and divorce rate were higher in low-SSR clusters, while male life expectancy, female life expectancy and total fertility rate were higher in a high-SSR cluster.

Other new world order disasters, less dramatic, receive only intermittent attention. These include such items as the effect of sanctions on medical care, nutrition and infant mortality in Iraq; the daily toll in death and dismemberment of land mines in Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique, Afghanistan and elsewhere; the ongoing effects of radioactive contamination from Chernobyl and Chelyabinsk, and of deadly pollution of air, soil and groundwater by lead, other toxic metals and organic toxins in much of Eastern Europe. Dwarfing all of these is the implacable daily toll of poverty and its health consequences in the Third World; to cite the best-known statistic, the 40, 000 children who die each day. © 1999 by Routledge.

AB  - Diseases caused by infectious agents have profoundly affected both human history and biology. In demographic terms, infectious diseases - including both great epidemics, such as plague and smallpox, which have devastated human populations from ancient to modern times, and less dramatic, unnamed viral and bacterial infections causing high infant mortality - have likely claimed more lives than all wars, noninfectious diseases, and natural disasters taken together. In the face of such attack by microscopic invaders, human populations have been forced to adapt to infectious agents on the levels of both genes and culture. As agents of natural selection, infectious diseases have played a major role in the evolution of the human species. Infectious diseases have also been a prime mover in cultural transformation, as societies have responded to the social, economic, political, and psychological disruption engendered by acute epidemics (e.g. measles, influenza) and chronic, debilitating infectious diseases (e.g. malaria, schistosomiasis). Today, the global epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) provides a salient example of the processes underlying infectious-disease-related cultural transformations. As many of the examples cited in this review illustrate, human groups have often unwittingly facilitated the spread of infectious diseases through culturally coded patterns of behavior or through changes in the crucial relationships among infectious disease agents, their human and animal hosts, and the environments in which the host-agent interaction takes place. © 1997 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association) N.V.

Traumatic deaths could be due to war, suicide, homicide, accidents, sudden infant death syndrome, terrorism, pervasive epidemics, genocide, and natural disasters. Traumatic loss differs from nontraumatic loss in the psychological impact (Kauffman, 2002a).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the combined effect of radioactive and chemical factors on the reproductive health of a female rural population residing and working on territories contaminated after the Chornobyl accident.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sociological questioning and gynecological examination of 1850 women have been made including the evaluation of 29520 medical reports of deliveries, 19502 medical reports of newborns, 1694 medical reports of women with spontaneous abortions as well as the state of menstrual function in 480 girls-adolescents residing on the contaminated territories. The radioactive contamination of the studied territories as well as the total effective dose of radiation for the population was evaluated by the results of the general dosimetric dose established for settlements of Ukraine. Factors of the work environment (noise, microclimate, dust, bacterial air pollution, work intensity and strain) were studied by the common hygienic methods and assessed by the criteria of the "Hygienic Classification of Work..." # 4137-86. The residues of pesticides, their isomers and products of transformation in biological fluids (blood, breast milk, cord blood) were assayed by gas-liquid chromatography method and electron capture detector with the device "Kristallux 4000" and the model M-3700. Correlative, regression, and discriminative analyses were used for mathematical processing of the data.RESULTS: It is proved that the reproductive health of rural women has become significantly worse after the Chornobyl accident, the most expressed disorders are seen in young women aged under 30. Worsening of reproductive health is found being the result of a combined effect of factors of radioactive and nonradioactive nature, specific for territories of residence, occupational activity and style of life. In particular, the effect of pesticides at the background of the radioactive contamination is likely to be an additional risk factor of disorders of the reproductive health of women. According to the biomonitoring data the content of organochlorine pesticides in biological fluids of women with reproductive health disorders was significantly higher (p<0.05) vs. with healthy ones. It is established that women of the childbearing age residing on territories with the density of contamination of more than 5 Ci/km and with rates of pesticide load over 5 kg/ha should be referred to a high risk group of the reproductive health disorders.CONCLUSION: The perspectives of epidemiological studies on the reproductive health are related on the use of the combination of many-aspect healthcare and biological approaches. It is equally important to assess adequately the factors of environment and work-related conditions, and their combined effect with dwelling load.; Abstract available from the publisher. Kundiev Ju.

AB  - Methods of defining hospital disaster preparedness are poorly defined in the literature, leaving wide discrepancies between a hospital's self-reported preparedness and that assessed by an objective reviewer. This study compared self-reported surge capacity data from individual hospitals, obtained from a previously reported long-distance tabletop drill (LDTT) prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup tournament in Cape Town, South Africa, with surge capacity data assessed by an on-site survey inspection team. In this prospective, observational study, contact persons used in the prior LDTT assessing hospital disaster preparedness in the lead-up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup made surge capacity assessments (licensed bed capacity plus surge capacity beds) for the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), medical intensive care unit (MICU), and general medical/surgical beds in each hospital. Following the 2010 World Cup, this data was then re-evaluated by an on-site survey team consisting of two of the authors. The contact persons for the individual hospitals from the LDTT underreported their individual hospital's surge capacity in 86% (95% CI, 46%-99%) of RICU beds; 100% (95% CI, 63%-100%) of MICU beds; 75% (95% CI, 40%-94%) of NICU beds; and 71% (95% CI, 35%-92%) of medical/surgical beds compared with the on-site inspection team. The contact persons for the LDTT overwhelmingly underreported surge capacity beds compared with the surge capacity determined by the on-site inspection team.

AB  - South Africa has reached a medium level of human development and has a heterogeneous situation with respect to disaster risk management. In this article, a preliminary assessment of the gender aspects of disaster vulnerability and fatalities is presented. The United Nations, the Health Systems Trust and Statistics South Africa were used as data sources for the following gender-segregated values: the life expectancy at birth, unemployment rates, the human development index values, the maternal mortality rates and the number of deaths from unnatural and non-natural causes. The relevant inequality indices were then calculated and used to draw conclusions regarding the gender aspects of disaster risk management in South Africa. Results of the calculations indicate that between 1980 and 2011 men were 10% more vulnerable with respect to their health status. However, the gender differences have been decreasing in recent years. Access of women to healthcare is decreasing with time, potentially decreasing the recovery potential of whole families. Women are more economically vulnerable than men in South Africa, as they are 16.3%-33% more likely to be unemployed than men. Educational status of both genders in South Africa is comparable based on literacy and enrolment rates at primary and secondary level. On the other hand, men are ive times more likely to suffer fatal injuries during disasters. © 2013. The Authors.

In contrast, there has been no clear evidence for radiation-induced germ cell mutations in humans that lead to birth defects, chromosome aberrations, Mendelian disorders, etc. This situation exists partly because no sensitive and practical genetic marker is available for human studies and also because the number of people exposed to large doses of radiation and subsequently having offspring was small until childhood cancer survivors became an important study population. In addition, the genome of apparently normal individuals seems to contain large numbers of alterations, including dozens to hundreds of nonfunctional alleles. With the number of mutational events in protein-coding genes estimated as less than one per genome after 1 gray (Gy) exposure, it is unsurprising that genetic effects from radiation have not yet been detected conclusively in humans. © 2013 by Annual Reviews.

AB  - The world's worst industrial disaster, at Union Carbide, Bhopal, India, took place on 2-3 December 1984, leading to the leakage of poisonous methyl-isocyanate into the environment, causing thousands of deaths, pregnancy loss and for some, incapacitation for life. More than a quarter of a century later, the Indian Council of Medical Research undertook to redefine the abysmal consequences of the toxic gas exposure on the exposed population. This invigorated the interest of scientific community in the evaluation of the long-term effects, with reference to cytogenetic parameters. The thrust area was identified in terms of genetic disorders, low birth weight, developmental/growth disorders and congenital malformations. Also the impact on epigenetic factors, which may have contributed to variations in the functional expression of genes, was not negated, stimulating intense scientific research on in utero exposure and the progeny of the exposed population. To accomplish this mammoth task, molecular cytogenetic investigations must be undertaken in conjunction with conventional cytogenetics, using techniques such as FISH, Immuno-FISH, SKY and SNP analysis, to build up a cytogenetic database of the surviving population. © 2013 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - The objective of this study is to empirically test the effects of disasters which include natural as well as human made disasters such as armed conflict on women's reproductive health in developing countries. Data from 128 developing countries are used. It was found that average number of deaths from natural disasters and armed conflict in the East Asia and Pacific region was not significantly different from the rest of the developing world. The data are examined using structural equation analysis. This study finds that 'armed conflict' in developing countries presents significant reproductive health risks. The implications are discussed.

AB  - Field hospitals were deployed by the Israel Defense Forces as part of the international relief efforts after major seismic events, one in Haiti (2010) and one in Japan (2011). The teams treated a total of 44 pregnant and 24 nonpregnant women and performed 16 deliveries and three cesarean deliveries under extreme conditions. Half of all deliveries were complicated by preeclampsia and 31% were preterm (at 30-32 weeks of gestation). It is imperative that obstetrician-gynecologists be included among humanitarian aid delegations sent to sites of natural disasters. The complicated cases we encountered required highly skilled obstetricians and led to a shortage of specific medications for these women. Cases that would have been considered routine under normal conditions created unanticipated ethical and practical issues in the face of very limited resources. The aim of this commentary is to share the experiences and lessons learned by our field hospital obstetrics and gynecology teams after the major earthquakes in Haiti and Japan. We present what we consider to be the 10 most important lessons learned and propose that they serve as guidelines in preparing for essential needs in other natural disaster settings. © 2013 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Globally, Pakistan has the third highest burden of maternal, fetal, and child mortality. It has made slow progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5 and in addressing common social determinants of health. The country also has huge challenges of political fragility, complex security issues, and natural disasters. We undertook an in-depth analysis of Pakistan's progress towards MDGs 4 and 5 and the principal determinants of health in relation to reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health and nutrition. We reviewed progress in relation to new and existing public sector programmes and the challenges posed by devolution in Pakistan. Notwithstanding the urgent need to tackle social determinants such as girls' education, empowerment, and nutrition in Pakistan, we assessed the Effect of systematically increasing coverage of various evidence-based interventions on populations at risk (by residence or poverty indices). We specifi cally focused on scaling up interventions using delivery platforms to reach poor and rural populations through community-based strategies. Our model indicates that with successful implementation of these strategies, 58% of an estimated 367 900 deaths (15 900 maternal, 169 000 newborn, 183 000 child deaths) and 49% of an estimated 180 000 stillbirths could be prevented in 2015.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report an experience with a full-scale neonatal intensive care unit evacuation exercise. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of lessons learned from a full-scale evacuation exercise following a simulated catastrophe. Thirty-four realistically simulated neonatal intensive care unit infants (including 12 infants who required respiratory support and 3 with very complex medical issues) were horizontally evacuated emergently to limit immediate danger, followed by a vertical evacuation down several flights of stairs to a temporary holding area. The infants were then set up for transport for ongoing care to other regional hospitals. As with a real emergency, the drill involved the hospital incident management resources plus external partners (eg, police, public health, and fire departments). RESULTS: We found that effective and constant communication was critical. Essential health care personnel resources included (1) staff to physically transport patients, (2) a central communication/coordinating site, and (3) on-site triage in the holding areas. Because it is impossible to anticipate every eventuality, flexibility and creativity are essential in disaster management. Adult tracking forms, equipment, and emergency procedures were nontransferable and often inappropriate for infants. CONCLUSIONS: When a disaster occurs, hospital clinical staff, emergency management, and administrators may help avoid unnecessarily high morbidity and mortality among the smallest and most vulnerable patients by developing and practicing contingency plans. We learned what our rate-limiting steps are and how we would mitigate these. Copyright © 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - The major staple food crops production is not able to fulfill food requirement of the global population due to relatively higher population growth rate in developing countries. The research on these crops for exploring their ultimate yield potential is currently at a plateau level. To replace the existing pressure on these major crops there is an urgent need to explore other alternative crops having the potential to replace and fulfill the available food demand. FAO statistics reveal that there is a high frequency of low birth weight children in the developing countries, which is primarily due to deficiency of micronutrients in the mother's diet. Amaranth, an underutilized crop and a cheap source of proteins, minerals, vitamin A and C, seems to be a future crop which can substantiate this demand due to its tremendous yield potential and nutritional qualities, also recently gained worldwide attention. Recently, current interest in amaranth also resides in the fact that it has a great amount of genetic diversity, phenotypic plasticity, and is extremely adaptable to adverse growing conditions, resists heat and drought, has no major disease problem, and is among the easiest of plants to grow in agriculturally marginal lands. The present review is an effort to gather the available knowledge on various diversified fields of sciences for the future exploitation of the crop. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Loss and grief are universal experiences and much has been written about both. Understanding Loss and Grief: A Guide Through Life Changing Events is a comprehensive self-help book about the various types of loss we may experience over a lifetime, and the attendant grief we feel, in all its variations, related to those losses. Nanette Burton Mongelluzzo considers the variety of ways we experience loss and grief - whether through the actual death of a loved one, including a beloved pet, or losses experienced through divorce, medical problems, natural disasters (material items) - abd examines what these experiences do to us psychologically, biologically, and emotionally. She offers understanding and the we need tools for moving through the various experiences, both big and small. Everyone is touched by loss. It begins early in our lives and continues through its various ages and stages. Through the use of real-life vignettes, and fascinating facts on loss and grief within the American cultural landscape, the author sheds light on the ways we grieve and how we can move through it and move on. She not only explains the comprehensive array of losses that can occur in a lifetime, but also helps readers garner support for different types of loss, whether it be the loss of a breast through cancer; the loss experienced through stillbirth; or the loss of a child, spouse, or entire community. She offers support, optimism, and encouragement to readers, helping them to own personal experiences, even those that involve loss and grief. © 2013 by Rowman & Littlefield. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the largest famines in human history took place in China half a century ago. This disaster, lasting from 1958 to 1961 in many areas, resulted in a huge number of excess deaths. While the causes, magnitude and profound impacts of this catastrophe have been brought to light in recent decades, many issues about the famine remain to be adequately examined. This paper aims to fill some gaps in our knowledge about the demography of China's great famine. It concentrates on the demographic consequences of the famine and individual demographic responses in some of the most severely affected provinces. By analysing demographic data collected by China's 1982 and 1988 national fertility sample surveys, the study provides further insights on changes in marriage, mortality, fertility and pregnancy outcomes during the famine period. The study reveals a dramatic increase in mortality and a decrease in marriage and fertility during the famine period, which had a significant impact on Chinese population. There were remarkable differences, however, in the demographic consequences of the famine between urban and rural areas and in demographic responses between people with different social and demographic characteristics. These findings are very important in improving our understanding of past demographic behaviour. © I.N.E.D. Tous droits réservés pour tous pays.

AB  - Research on the developmental origins of health and disease highlights the plasticity of the human fetus to a host of potential teratogens. Experimental research on laboratory animals has demonstrated a variety of physical and behavioral effects among offspring exposed to prenatal maternal stress (PNMS). However, these studies cannot elucidate the relative effects of the objective stress exposure and the subjective distress in a way that would parallel the stress experience in humans. PNMS research with humans is also limited because there are ethical challenges to designing studies that involve the random assignment of pregnant women to varying levels of independent stressors. Natural disasters present opportunities for natural experiments of the effects of pregnant women's exposure to stress on child development. In this review, we present an overview of the human and animal research on PNMS, and highlight the results of Project Ice Storm which has been following the cognitive, behavioral, motor and physical development of children exposed in utero to the January 1998 Quebec Ice Storm. We have found that both objective degree of exposure to the storm and the mothers' subjective distress have strong and persistent effects on child development, and that these effects are often moderated by the timing of the ice storm in pregnancy and by the child's sex. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The Chernobyl disaster in 1986 involved the largest airborne release of radioactivity in history, more than 100 times as much radioactivity as the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs together. The resulting emergency response, administrative blunders, and subsequent patient outcomes from this large-scale radiological disaster provide a wealth of information and valuable lessons for those who may find themselves having to deal with the staggering consequences of nuclear war. Research findings, administrative strategies (successful and otherwise), and resulting clinical procedures from the Chernobyl experience are reviewed to determine a current utility in addressing the appropriate protocols for a medical response to nuclear war. As various myths are still widely associated with radiation exposure, attention is given to the realities of a mass casualty medical response as it would occur with a nuclear detonation. ©2012 American Medical Association.

AB  - Background: Reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health policy debates. In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (UIs), separately by age and sex. Methods: We attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the data. For 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95% UIs. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the GBD 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E, and HIV/AIDS), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95% UIs that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where CODEm was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions. Findings: In 2010, there were 52·8 million deaths globally. At the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24·9% of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15·9 million (34·1%) of 46·5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2·5 to 1·4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3·4 to 2·8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3·1 to 2·2 million), measles (from 0·63 to 0·13 million), and tetanus (from 0·27 to 0·06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0·30 million in 1990 to 1·5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1·7 million in 2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19·9% since 1990 to 1·17 million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1·2 million people in 2010. Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34·5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38% more than two decades ago; of these, 1·5 million (19%) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12·9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1·3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5·1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9·6%) compared with two decades earlier (8·8%). This was driven by a 46% rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1·3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for HIV/AIDS and preterm birth complications. YLLs from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54% since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke YLLs increased by 17-28%. Regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76% of premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose (HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, COPD, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted. Interpretation: Population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of YLLs in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis.

AB  - Adolescence is life stage typical of Homo sapiens. Reproduction during adolescence, i.e. teenage pregnancies is still listed among the most important public health problems of the 21rst century, although low maternal age may be a marker for social rather than biological or medical disadvantage. Data from developed countries indicate that an optimal prenatal program eliminates obstetrical risks among adolescent mothers and adverse pregnancy outcome is mainly due to socioeconomic cofactors. Most teenage pregnancies are unplanned and result often in a social disaster. It is well documented that teenage mothers are more likely to drop out of school and have a low educational level. They are faced with unemployment and poverty. Consequently nearly all developed countries try to reduce teenage pregnancies and teenage motherhood effectively. The different countries however, use different strategies and these strategies differ regarding their effectiveness. In this review beside general aspects of pregnancies during adolescence, strategies to reduce teenage pregnancy rates are discussed. In particular the decline in teenage motherhood in Austria since the 1970s and is highlighted. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the vulnerability to floods in Guangdong province at district level.METHODS: Data were collected from the sixth census, the 2010 Statistical Yearbook of Guangdong, the 2010 Health Statistics Yearbook of Guangdong and China Disease Prevention and Control information systems, etc. The weight of each indicator was determined based on subjective method and objective method respectively; and finally the results of the two methods were compared.RESULTS: 13 indicators were selected for the assessment of vulnerability to floods, including 6 sensitivity indicators, 5 adaptability indicators and 2 exposure indicators. Indicators with large weight (subjective weight/objective weight) were the proportion of population older than 65 years old (0.31/0.30), the proportion of population older than 65 years old (0.16/0.23), infant mortality rate (0.18/0.20), the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (0.33/0.21), the proportion of illiterate in the population older than 15 years old (0.19/0.28), history frequency of floods (0.75/0.75). The mean vulnerability index (VI) calculated by subjective method was 0.35 with the standard deviation of 0.10; the mean vulnerability index calculated by objective method was 0.31 with the standard deviation of 0.08. The two weighting methods showed consistent results of vulnerability index (ICC = 0.975, P < 0.01). VI of most districts dropped in the interval of 0.30 - 0.39. Districts with subjective VI > 0.50 or objective VI > 0.40 should pay more attention to floods, including parts of the coastal areas, Beijiang River Basin, the eastern tributary area of Dongjiang River and the northern part of Pearl River Delta. Dapu district of Meizhou (0.55/0.45), Dianbai district and Maogang district of Maoming (0.54/0.48) were most vulnerable. Districts of Heyuan, Dongguan, Zhaoqing and Huizhou were less vulnerable, Yuancheng district of Heyuan showed least vulnerable to floods (0.15/0.12) followed by Dongguan (0.18/0.16), Duanzhou district (0.18/0.16) and Guangning (0.17/0.15) district of Zhaoqing. The score of indicators differed among different level of vulnerability (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Different regions of Guangdong province showed different vulnerability to floods, vulnerable areas should be priority in the prevention and control of floods.

AB  - Extrauterine pregnancy implies implantation of the product of conception outside the endometrial lining. It is a reproductive health disaster that presents itself in a bewildering variety of anatomical, physiological and clinical expressions as acute, subacute or chronic types. In the literature, there have been sparse reports of extrauterine pregnancy mistaken for intrauterine pregnancy, some of which even progressed to the third trimester; and despite the almost ubiquitous usage of prenatal ultrasound, extrauterine pregnancies may not be detected in a timely manner unless attention to basic clinical features, and high index of suspicion are followed.

In the months from January to June 2011, there was a +27.24% increase in the number of newborns (+ 91) delivered in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit of the San Salvatore Hospital of L'Aquila compared to the same six-month period in 2010. Methods: Between January 2010 and December 2010, 874 women gave birth in L'Aquila. The women living outside of L'Aquila were excluded from the study. The remaining women, namely a sample of 451 individuals, were administered a questionnaire that focused on the level of stress experienced during the earthquake, and subsequently the Brief Cope. Results: After the earthquake there was a +22.64% increase in the number of women who desired a pregnancy. The results of the Brief Cope show that the coping strategies used by the women in L'Aquila were active coping, planning, acceptance and positive reframing. Conclusions: The desire for motherhood was the main reason accounting for the increase in births that occurred after the earthquake. The decision to have a child was the tangible sign of adaptation to the post-traumatic stress. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a direct zoonotic disease caused by spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. Many animals act as carriers or vectors. Human infection results from accidental contact with carrier animals or environment contaminated with animal urine containing the organism. Epidemics of leptospirosis result from poor sanitation in urban areas and are aggravated following natural calamities. The majority of leptospiral infections are either subclinical or result in very mild illness and patients recover without complications. In a few cases it may manifest as multiorgan failure where the mortality can go up to 40%. Infection in pregnant women may be grave leading to severe fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. The presentation may mimic other viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections, acute fatty liver, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and HELLP syndrome. Owing to the unusual presentation, leptospirosis in pregnancy is often misdiagnosed and under-reported. Preventive public education regarding hygiene, personal practices, source reduction, environmental sanitation, early diagnosis, and treatment of the condition are needed to avoid perinatal and maternal mortality. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether the February 27th earthquake exposition was associated to adverse perinatal outcomes in Chilean pregnant women.Methods: We analyzed all deliveries occurred in 2009 (n = 3,609) and 2010 (n = 3,279) in a reference hospital in the area of the earthquake. Furthermore, we investigated pregnant women who gave birth between March 1st and December 31st 2010 (n = 2,553) and we classified them according to timing of exposition.Results: We found a 9% reduction in birth rate, but an increase in the rate of early preterm deliveries (<34 weeks), premature rupture of membranes (PROM), macrosomia, small for gestational age, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) after the earthquake, in contrast to the previous year. Women exposed to the earthquake during her first trimester delivered smaller newborns (3,340 ± 712 g v/s 3,426 ± 576 g respectively, p = 0.007) and were more likely diagnosed with early preterm delivery, preterm delivery (<37 weeks) and PROM but were less likely diagnosed with IUGR and late delivery (42 weeks, p < 0.05) compared to those exposed at third trimester. Accordingly, IUGR and preterm deliveries presented elevated healthcare costs.Conclusion: Natural disasters such as earthquakes are associated to adverse perinatal outcomes that impact negatively the entire maternal-neonatal healthcare system. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - The present article's major essence happens to be the history of the Puritans and their historiography. By the early seventeenth century a small group of religious separatists moved to Holland and then subsequently to New England to maintain their religious freedom that individuals' lives are governed by providence. Generally, the New England Puritans considered whatever happened to them as manifestations of divine will. Anxious to understand the hidden significance of daily events, they eagerly recorded what was happening to them. Thus, not only the histories they wrote but all kinds of writing-autobiographies, biographies, church histories, diaries, memoirs, poetry-reflect their quest to comprehend the meaning of whatever they encountered. In their quest to understand God's ways, seventeenth-century New England Puritans tried to see Providence in virtually everything, including natural phenomena both ordinary and extraordinary: birth defects, comets, earthquakes, eclipses, famine, hurricanes, or pestilence. A discussion on third generation puritans comes at the end of the article. © 2008 by Oxford University Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of pelvic arterial embolization (PAE) for the treatment of primary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and to determine the factors associated with clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: This retrospective single-center study was institutional review board approved, and informed consent was waived. Outcomes were analyzed in 251 patients who underwent PAE for primary PPH between January 2000 and February 2011. Mode of delivery, causes of bleeding, detailed laboratory and treatment records, and clinical outcomes were recorded. Clinical success was defined as cessation of bleeding after initial session of PAE without the need for additional PAE or surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the factors related to clinical outcomes. Results: The clinical success rate was 86.5% (217 of 251). Among the 34 failed cases, 12 underwent repeat PAE, 16 underwent additional surgery, and three recovered with conservative management. Overall bleeding control was achieved in 98.0% (246 of 251) of the patients. Overall mortality was 2% (five of 251) after the first (n = 3) or second (n = 1) session of PAE or additional surgery (n = 1). Among the 113 patients with long-term follow-up, 110 (97.3%) maintained a regular menstrual cycle and 11 had successful pregnancies. Univariate analysis showed that cesarean section delivery, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and massive transfusion of more than 10 red blood cell units were related to failed PAE. Multivariate analysis showed that DIC (odds ratio, 0.36; P = .04) and massive transfusion (odds ratio, 0.10; P < .001) were significantly related to clinical failure. Conclusion: PAE is safe and effective for managing primary PPH. Patients with DIC and massive transfusion were likely to have poor results after PAE. © RSNA, 2012.

AB  - Background: Child mortality estimates from complete birth histories from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) surveys and similar surveys are a chief source of data used to track Millennium Development Goal 4, which aims for a reduction of under-five mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. Based on the expected sample sizes when the DHS program commenced, the estimates are usually based on 5-y time periods. Recent surveys have had larger sample sizes than early surveys, and here we aimed to explore the benefits of using shorter time periods than 5 y for estimation. We also explore the benefit of changing the estimation procedure from being based on years before the survey, i.e., measured with reference to the date of the interview for each woman, to being based on calendar years. Methods and Findings: Jackknife variance estimation was used to calculate standard errors for 207 DHS surveys in order to explore to what extent the large samples in recent surveys can be used to produce estimates based on 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-y periods. We also recalculated the estimates for the surveys into calendar-year-based estimates. We demonstrate that estimation for 1-y periods is indeed possible for many recent surveys. Conclusions: The reduction in bias achieved using 1-y periods and calendar-year-based estimation is worthwhile in some cases. In particular, it allows tracking of the effects of particular events such as droughts, epidemics, or conflict on child mortality in a way not possible with previous estimation procedures. Recommendations to use estimation for short time periods when possible and to use calendar-year-based estimation were adopted in the United Nations 2011 estimates of child mortality. © 2012 Pedersen, Liu.

AB  - Ecological and social factors have a significant effect on infant survivorship in nonhuman primates. We present 6293 group-months of infant birth and mortality data for 29 groups of Alouatta caraya inhabiting a flooded forest in northeastern Argentina, collected over 1. 5-8 yr depending on the group. We tested whether infant mortality was a response to the effects of flooding on food availability and whether male takeovers resulted in greater opportunities for infanticide. During our study, 43 of 113 infants died at a mean age of 5 mo. In 24 cases the cause of death was unknown. In the remaining 19 cases infant deaths were attributed to periods of intense flooding (N = 8), replacement of the breeding male (N = 8), problems associated with birth (N = 2), and injuries during an intergroup encounter (N = 1). Flooding reduced the availability of mature leaves, which appeared to play an important role in the ability of mothers to nurse their offspring. Male replacements occurred in four social groups that contained only one fully adult male. Infant mortality was significantly higher in groups that experienced male replacement compared to groups without male replacement. These results indicate that infant mortality in Alouatta caraya is affected by several factors-natural disasters, maternal condition and food availability, infanticide after male replacement, and possibly disease and predation-each of which needs to be evaluated to understand the history and demography of this primate population. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Pakistan has the world's third highest national number of newborn deaths (194 000 in 2010). Major national challenges over the past decade have affected health and development including several large humanitarian disasters, destabilizing political insurgency, high levels of poverty and an often hard-to-reach predominately rural population with diverse practices. As part of a multi-country analysis, we examined changes for newborn survival between 2000 and 2010 in terms of mortality, coverage and health system indicators as well as national and donor funding. Neonatal mortality declined by only 0.9 per annum between 2000 and 2010; less than the global average (2.1) and less than national maternal and child mortality declines. Coverage of newborn care interventions increased marginally, with wide socio-economic variations. There was little focus on newborn health until 2000 when considerable policy change occurred, including integration of newborn care into existing community-based maternal and child packages delivered by the Lady Health Worker Programme and national behaviour change communications strategies and programmes. The National Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Programme catalyzed newborn services at both facility and community levels. Civil society and academics have linked with government and several research studies have been highly influential. Since 2005, donor funding mentioning the term 'newborn' has increased more for Pakistan than for other countries. The country faces ongoing challenges in reducing neonatal mortality, and in much of Pakistan, societal norms discourage care-seeking and many women are unable to access care for themselves or their children. The policy advances and existing delivery platforms offer the potential to substantially accelerate progress in reducing neonatal deaths. The recent decision to dismantle the national Ministry of Health and devolve responsibility for health sector management to the provincial level presents both challenges and opportunities for newborn health. © 2012 The Author.

AB  - Objective: This project evaluated New York (NY) hospitals outside of New York City (upstate) for their awareness and utilization of the NY State Department of Health Pediatric and Obstetric Emergency Preparedness Toolkit (toolkit) and presence of pediatric emergency preparedness planning elements. Methods: A survey assessing toolkit awareness and utilization was distributed to all 145 upstate NY hospitals. Quantitative survey data were analyzed using summary statistics, x 2 analysis, and odds ratios (OR) in aggregate, by hospital size, and by presence of pediatric medicine/surgery, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and/or neonatal ICU (NICU) beds (pediatric beds). Results: Of the 145 hospitals, 116 (80%) completed the survey; 86% of these had reviewed the toolkit. Most had staff clinicians with pediatric expertise, but fewer had appointed pediatric clinical (physician or nurse) coordinators. Hospitals with at least one pediatric bed were more than 2.5 times more likely to have an emergency management plan (EMP) for pediatric patients (P=.0223) and nearly 8 times more likely to have appointed a pediatric physician coordinator (P<.0001) than were hospitals without pediatric beds. Appointment of a pediatric clinical coordinator was significantly associated (P<.001) with presence of various pediatric emergency plan elements (OR range: 3.06-15.13), while staff pediatric clinical expertise or toolkit review were not. Conclusions: Appointment of at least one pediatric clinical coordinator and the presence of one or more pediatric beds were significantly associated with having developed key EMP pediatric elements. Further research should examine barriers to pediatric clinical coordinator appointment and explore the awareness that pediatric patients may arrive at nonpediatric hospitals during a disaster with no option for transfer. ©2012 American Medical Association.

AB  - Objective: To analyze various hazardous obstetrical problems and pregnancy outcome in flood affected pregnant women. Study Design: Descriptive case series. Place: Flood affected camps at District Jamshoro,Dadu,and Hydeabad Sindh. Methodology: This study was conducted at flood relief camps at District Jamshoro, Dadu and Hyderabad from August 2010 to November 2010. During this study period all the pregnant women with various obstetrical problems were included while the pregnant women with other medical problems having no direct or indirect effect on pregnancy like gastroenteritis, skin problems were excluded from the study. These women were registered on pre-designed proforma. Data were collected and analyzed on SPSS version 16. Result: Total 571 (15.01%) women were having different obstetrical problems during the study period. Majority of these women 313 (54.81%) were in between 21-30 years of age group and were in last trimester of pregnancy 359 (62.87%). Commonest obstetrical problems seen in flood affected women were anaemia in 399 (69.87%) cases. Their hemoglobin percentage was below 9 gram, abruptio placentae in 79 (13.83%) cases, premature rupture of membranes in 69 (12.08%). Maternal morbidity seen was due to obstetrical trauma in 157 (27.49%) cases, post partum haemorrhage in 143 (25.04%) cases. Fetal problems seen were low birth weight in 237 (41.50%) cases, still birth in 67 (11.73%) cases. Conclusion: Pregnant women were severely affected by the flood having major impact on their health, life and their off spring.

AB  - Little is known about pediatric surgical disease in resource-poor countries. This study documents the surgical care of children in central Haiti and demonstrates the influence of the 2010 earthquake on pediatric surgical delivery. Methods. We conducted a retrospective review of operations performed at Partners in Health/Zanmi Lasante hospitals in central Haiti. Results. Of 2,057 operations performed prior to the earthquake, 423 were pediatric (20.6%). Congenital anomalies were the most common operative indication (159/423 operations; 33.5%). Pediatric surgical volume increased significantly after the earthquake, with 670 operations performed (23.0% post-earthquake v. 20.6% pre-earthquake, p=03). Trauma and burns became the most common surgical diagnoses after the disaster, and operations for non-traumatic conditions decreased significantly (p<01). Conclusion. Congenital anomalies represent a significant proportion of baseline surgical need in Haiti. A natural disaster can change the nature of pediatric surgical practice by significantly increasing demand for operative trauma care for months afterward. © Meharry Medical College.

AB  - On 12 May 2008, a devastating earthquake occurred in Sichuan Province, China, taking tens of thousands of lives and destroying the homes of millions of people. Among the large number of dead or missing were children, particularly children aged less than five years old, a fact which drew significant media attention. To obtain relevant information specifically to aid further studies and future preventative measures, a neural network model was proposed to explore some geological and socio-demographic factors associated with earthquake-related child mortality. Sensitivity analysis showed that topographic slope (mean 35.76%), geomorphology (mean 24.18%), earthquake intensity (mean 13.68%), and average income (mean 11%) had great contributions to child mortality. These findings could provide some clues to researchers for further studies and to policy makers in deciding how and where preventive measures and corresponding policies should be implemented in the reconstruction of communities. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that earthquake severely threatens life-safety and physical damage. However, the empirical literature on the effects of nature disasters such as earthquake on the reproductive outcomes is limited. METHODS: On May 12th, 2008, a massive 8.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in Wenchuan, a city 92km away from our animal facility [National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs (NCCSED)]. To investigate whether this tremendous earthquake exerted adverse effects on the reproductive and developmental functions in Sprague-Dawley rats, we collected some relevant data from reproductive toxicity studies around the earthquake, and compared them with the background data, which were gathered before and after the earthquake. Copulation ratio, gestation ratio, and fertility of female rats, as well as uterine and fetal morphology, were examined. RESULTS:: Our data demonstrated that the Wenchuan earthquake significantly decreased the copulation and gestation ratio, although it did not exhibit obvious side effects on some other reproductive and developmental parameters. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Debris flows are a significant geologic hazard worldwide, resulting in fatalities, property damage, and limiting the use of extensive areas of land. As is reflected in other studies of natural hazards, debris flows are “disasters of social vulnerability,” where the hardest hit populations are the least wealthy and influential, living in unsafe houses, and neglected in the crisis itself. In the last two years, debris flows have killed over a thousand people in poor communities in Mexico, China, and Brazil. A literature review, the basis of this study, recorded almost 93,000 debris-flow fatalities from 177 events in 33 countries. The study covered the period 1950–2010, indicating an average of 1550 fatalities per year, with a median of 14 fatalities per event and a 75th percentile value of 121. These numbers should be considered minimums for fatalities per year and maximums for fatalities per event, since smaller events, which are typically not recorded in published technical literature, are not included in the database. High fatality events typically corresponded to low per capita income, high public sector corruption, high maternal mortality rates, and possibly higher literacy rates, although there are alternate explanations for the latter. Most locations did not have any mitigation elements in place, but many had indications of recent, historic or prehistoric debris flows in the same area that could have served as warning signs. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - This paper describes the selection, design, successful application and performance monitoring of Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESP) in the giant Mangala oil field and Thumbli water field situated in the Barmer basin in Rajasthan, India. Mangala oil field contains in excess of 1 billion barrels of STOIIP (Stock Tank Oil Initially in Place) in high-quality fluvial reservoirs. The field was brought on production in August 2009 and is currently producing at the plateau production rate of 150,000 bopd of which approximately more than one- third of the oil production is from the ESP oil wells. To support the water requirement of Mangala and other satellite oil fields, Thumbli source water field was developed with 5 water production wells with up to 4 wells operating at a time. Each of these water wells is installed with 60,000 bwpd capacity pumps and the field is currently producing up to 225,000 bwpd to meet the water requirements of Mangala and other satellite fields. The Mangala oil field is a multilayer, multi-Darcy reservoir, has waxy viscous crude with in-situ oil viscosity up to 22 cp and wax content in the range of 18 to 26%. The field was developed using hot water flood for pressure maintenance. Significant production challenges included unfavorable mobility ratio with early water cut and hence the early requirement of artificial lift to maintain the plateau production rate. The field has 12 horizontal producers and 92 deviated producers. ESP was selected as the artificial lift method for the high rate horizontal producers while hot water jet pumping was selected as the artificial lift method for low rate deviated oil wells. Each horizontal well is capable of producing up to 15,000 blpd and high rate ESPs were designed and installed to deliver the production requirement. Currently 8 of the 12 horizontal producers are on ESP lift and the remaining four wells are planned for ESP installation in the near future. Apart from two early ESP failures during installation, ESPs have had a good run life; the paper also describes lessons learnt from the infant mortalities. The Thumbli water field, located ~20 km southeast of Mangala field has been developed to meet the water requirement of Mangala and other satellite fields. Thumbli water aquifer is a shallow water field which contains water of ~ 5000 ppm salinity with dissolved CO2, oxygen, chlorides and sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). 5 high capacity water wells were drilled in Thumbli field to meet the huge water demand from Mangala for water injection in Mangala and satellite field injector wells, hot water circulation in oil production wells and associated water requirement for boilers etc. 1000 HP water well ESPs were designed to produce up to 60,000 bwpd from each well with installed water production capacity of up to 300,000 bwpd from Thumbli field. A state of the art ESP control and monitoring architecture including ESP tornado plotting was developed and successfully implemented in the ICSS to remotely operate, monitor and optimize ESP well performance from the central control room within Mangala field and from the company headquarter located in Gurgaon. © 2012 Society of Petroleum Engineers.

AB  - The Central American nation of Honduras, one of the hemisphere's poorest countries, faces significant challenges in the areas of crime, human rights, and improving overall economic and living conditions. While traditional agricultural exports of coffee and bananas are still important for the economy, nontraditional sectors, especially the maquiladora, or export-processing industry, have grown significantly over the past decade. Among the country's development challenges are a poverty rate over 60%, high infant mortality, and a significant HIV/AIDS epidemic. Despite these challenges, increased public spending on health and education have reaped significant improvements in development indicators over the past decade. Current President Manuel Zelaya of the Liberal Party won a four-year term in the November 2005 elections. The country has enjoyed 27 years of uninterrupted elected civilian democratic rule. The economy, which grew 6.3% in 2007 and is expected to have grown 4% in 2008, has benefitted from significant debt reduction by the international financial institutions that is freeing government resources to finance poverty-reduction programs. The U.S. recession and global financial crisis, however, are expected to slow Honduran economic growth sharply in 2009. The United States has a close relationship with Honduras, characterized by an important trade partnership, a U.S. military presence in the country, and cooperation on a range of transnational issues. In addition to being a party to the Dominican Republic- Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), Honduras has cooperated extensively with the United States on counternarcotics and port security. Some 78,000 Hondurans living in the United States have been provided temporary protected status (TPS) since the country was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998. U.S. foreign aid to Honduras amounted to $44 million in FY2008 and an estimated $47 million in FY2009. Honduras is also likely to receive a portion of the $105 million in assistance dedicated to Central America in 2009 under the Mérida Initiative, which was designed to boost the region's capabilities to interdict the smuggling of drugs, arms, and people and support a regional anti-gang strategy. For FY2010, the Obama Administration requested over $68 million in assistance for Honduras as well as an additional $100 million for the continuation of the Mérida Initiative in Central America. Beyond traditional foreign assistance, the Millennium Challenge Corporation approved a five-year $215 million compact with Honduras in 2005. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - From 1935, in a way that now seems almost surreal, Ukraine’s UNKhU (Directorate for National Economy and Account) challenged the figures on births and deaths registered between 1930 and 1935. In a note addressed to the leadership of the Republic’s Communist Party, presenting them with some figures on annual change in the Ukrainian population between 1926 and 1934 (Table 2.1), Aleksandr Asatkin, Director of the UNKhU of Ukraine, expressed his amazement at the peak in mortality observed in 1933, and attempted to explain it through errors in the registration system (ZAGS), without, of course, ever mentioning the famine that had reached its highest level in that year. However, checks made in 1934-1935 on the way ZAGS functioned showed that deaths in the regions most affected by the disaster had in fact been under-registered. Moreover, ZAGS’ final results for 1933 were much higher than this 1935 document showed (see N.B. in Table 2.1; Annex I, Tables 1 and 2 on the CD-ROM). In reality, the presence of famine was clear, but everything was done to conceal it. Monitors from the TsUNKhU (Central Directorate for National Economy and Account), covering the whole USSR, systematically reclassified deaths initially classified as “from starvation” under either “cause of death unknown” or “from exhaustion”. © 2012, Springer Netherlands.

AB  - Background: In late October 2003, a series of wildfires exposed urban populations in Southern California to elevated levels of air pollution over several weeks. Previous research suggests that short-term hospital admissions for respiratory outcomes increased specifically as a result of these fires. Objective: We assessed the impact of a wildfire event during pregnancy on birth weight among term infants. Methods: Using records for singleton term births delivered to mothers residing in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) during 2001-2005 (n = 886,034), we compared birth weights from pregnancies that took place entirely before or after the wildfire event (n = 747,590) with those where wildfires occurred during the first (n = 60,270), second (n = 39,435), or third (n = 38,739) trimester. The trimester-specific effects of wildfire exposure were estimated using a fixed-effects regression model with several maternal characteristics included as covariates. R esults: Compared with pregnancies before and after the wildfires, mean birth weight was estimated to be 7.0 g lower [95% confidence interval (CI): -11.8, -2.2] when the wildfire occurred during the third trimester, 9.7 g lower when it occurred during the second trimester (95% CI: -14.5, -4.8), and 3.3 g lower when it occurred during the first trimester (95% CI: -7.2, 0.6). C onclusions: Pregnancy during the 2003 Southern California wildfires was associated with slightly reduced average birth weight among infants exposed in utero. The extent and increasing frequency of wildfire events may have implications for infant health and development.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Iodine, as a trace element, is a necessary and limiting substrate for thyroid gland hormone synthesis. It is an essential element that enables the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Synthesis of Thyroid Hormones and Iodine Metabolism. Three iodine molecules are added to make triiodothyronine, and four for thyroxine - the two key hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Iodine deficiency The proper daily amount of iodine is required for optimal thyroid function. Iodine deficiency can cause hypothyroidism, developmental brain disorders and goiter. Iodine deficiency is the single most common cause of preventable mental retardation and brain damage in the world. It also decreases child survival, causes goiters, and impairs growth and development. Iodine deficiency disorders in pregnant women cause miscarriages, stillbirths, and other complications. Children with iodine deficiency disorders can grow up stunted, apathetic, mentally retarded, and incapable of normal movements, speech or hearing. Excessive Iodine Intake. Excessive iodine intake, which can trigger a utoimmune thyroid disease and dysfunction. is on the other side. Iodine use in Case of Nuclear Catastrophe. In addition to other severe consuquences of radioactivity, high amount of radioactive iodine causes significant increase in incidence of thyroid gland carcinoma after some of the nuclear catastrophes (Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Chernobyl, Fukushima). The incidence of thyroid carcinoma was increased mostly in children. This paper was aimed at clarifying some of the possibilities of prevention according to the recommendations given by the World Health Organization.

AB  - Regulatory science plays a vital role in protecting and promoting global public health by providing the scientific basis for ensuring that food and medical products are safe, properly labeled, and effective. Regulatory science research was first developed for the determination of product safety in the early part of the 20th Century, and continues to support innovation of the processes needed for regulatory policy decisions. Historically, public health laws and regulations were enacted following public health tragedies, and often the research tools and techniques required to execute these laws lagged behind the public health needs. Throughout history, similar public health problems relating to food and pharmaceutical products have occurred in countries around the world, and have usually led to the development of equivalent solutions. For example, most countries require a demonstration of pharmaceutical safety and efficacy prior to marketing these products using approaches that are similar to those initiated in the United States. The globalization of food and medical products has created a shift in regulatory compliance such that gaps in food and medical product safety can generate international problems. Improvements in regulatory research can advance the regulatory paradigm toward a more preventative, proactive framework. These improvements will advance at a greater pace with international collaboration by providing additional resources and new perspectives for approaching and anticipating public health problems. The following is a review of how past public health disasters have shaped the current regulatory landscape, and where innovation can facilitate the shift from reactive policies to proactive policies.

AB  - Experiencing natural disasters such as hurricanes is associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. We examined the role played by perceived stress and coping styles in explaining and modifying this association among pregnant women exposed to Hurricane Katrina. The study comprised 192 women (133 from New Orleans and 59 from Baton Rouge) who were pregnant during Hurricane Katrina or became pregnant immediately after the hurricane. Women were interviewed regarding their hurricane experience, perceived stress, and mental health outcomes. Coping styles was assessed using the Brief COPE, PTSD symptoms using the Post-Traumatic Checklist, and depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Depression Scale. Multivariable regression models were run to determine the effects of coping styles on mental health and the interactions among coping styles, hurricane experience, and perceived stress on mental health. Apart from the positive reframing and humor coping styles, all coping styles correlated positively with PTSD or depression (p < 0.05). The instrumental support, denial, venting, and behavioral disengagement coping styles were significantly associated with worsened PTSD symptoms among those who reported higher perceived stress (p < 0.05). Use of a humor coping style seemed to reduce the effect of perceived stress on depressive symptoms (p = 0.02 for interaction) while use of instrumental support (p = 0.04) and behavioral disengagement (p < 0.01) were both associated with more symptoms of depression among those who perceived more stress. There were no strong interactions between coping style and hurricane experience. Coping styles are potential moderators of the effects of stress on mental health of pregnant women.

AB  - Background Estimation of the number and rate of deaths by age and sex is a key first stage for calculation of the burden of disease in order to constrain estimates of cause-specific mortality and to measure premature mortality in populations. We aimed to estimate life tables and annual numbers of deaths for 187 countries from 1970 to 2010. Methods We estimated trends in under-5 mortality rate; children aged 0-4 years) and probability of adult death (15-59 years) for each country with all available data. Death registration data were available for more than 100 countries and we corrected for undercount with improved death distribution methods. We applied refined methods to survey data on sibling survival that correct for survivor, zero-sibling, and recall bias. We separately estimated mortality from natural disasters and wars. We generated final estimates of under-5 mortality and adult mortality from the data with Gaussian process regression. We used these results as input parameters in a relational model life table system. We developed a model to extrapolate mortality to 110 years of age. All death rates and numbers have been estimated with 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UIs). Findings From 1970 to 2010, global male life expectancy at birth increased from 56 4 years (95% UI 55 5-57 2) to 67 5 years (66 9-68 1) and global female life expectancy at birth increased from 61 2 years (60 2-62 0) to 73 3 years (72 8-73 8). Life expectancy at birth rose by 3-4 years every decade from 1970, apart from during the 1990s; increase in male life expectancy of 1 4 years and in female life expectancy of 1 6 years). Substantial reductions in mortality occurred in eastern and southern sub-Saharan Africa since 2004, coinciding with increased coverage of antiretroviral therapy and preventive measures against malaria. Sex-specific changes in life expectancy from 1970 to 2010 ranged from gains of 23-29 years in the Maldives and Bhutan to declines of 1-7 years in Belarus, Lesotho, Ukraine, and Zimbabwe. Globally, 52 8 million (95% UI 51 6-54 1 million) deaths occurred in 2010, which is about 13 5% more than occurred in 1990 (46 5 million [45 7-47 4 million]), and 21 9% more than occurred in 1970 (43 3 million [42 2-44 6 million]). Proportionally more deaths in 2010 occurred at age 70 years and older (42 8% in 2010 vs 33 1% in 1990), and 22 9% occurred at 80 years or older. Deaths in children younger than 5 years declined by almost 60% since 1970 (16 4 million [16 1-16 7 million] in 1970 vs 6 8 million [6 6-7 1 million] in 2010), especially at ages 1-59 months (10 8 million [10 4-11 1 million] in 1970 vs 4 0 million [3 8-4 2 million] in 2010). In all regions, including those most affected by HIV/AIDS, we noted increases in mean ages at death. Interpretation Despite global and regional health crises, global life expectancy has increased continuously and substantially in the past 40 years. Yet substantial heterogeneity exists across age groups, among countries, and over different decades. 179 of 187 countries have had increases in life expectancy after the slowdown in progress in the 1990s. Efforts should be directed to reduce mortality in low-income and middle-income countries. Potential underestimation of achievement of the Millennium Development Goal 4 might result from limitations of demographic data on child mortality for the most recent time period. Improvement of civil registration system worldwide is crucial for better tracking of global mortality.

AB  - Hospital emergency management has evolved beyond satisfying regulatory requirements. Although tools and resources have been developed to support hospitals in emergency planning, there appears to be a scarcity of resources to guide hospital departments. To ensure that standards of care are maintained and to minimize the impact on the hospital and/or a nursing unit, Good Samaritan Hospital has developed a mobile emergency system and an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) template to assist other nursing units in their planning efforts. This article focuses on the development of emergency bedside backpacks, mobile disaster boxes, disaster documentation and forms go-kits, and guidelines for creating such a plan. The ongoing equipment testing, inventory rotation, staff training, and exercising response protocols are all crucial to test the effectiveness of the program in place. All these activities require a multidisciplinary approach to ensure integration with hospital-wide emergency planning efforts. © 2012 Springer Publishing.

AB  - Sri Lanka, a non-industrialized country with limited resources, has been able to achieve a maternal mortality ratio that is markedly lower than the ratios of similar countries. Many factors have contributed to Sri Lanka's success story. A political commitment to the cause and implementation of clear policies through well-structured and organized community-based and institutional healthcare services - expanded to cover the whole country and provided free of charge - have been the foundation of maternal and child health (MCH) services in the country. The healthcare programs have been well accepted and utilized by the people as the literacy rate is more than 90% for both men and women. Public health midwives form the backbone of MCH services and provide frontline reproductive health care. More than 98% of deliveries occur in hospitals and are attended by midwives. Furthermore, 85% of women in Sri Lanka deliver in facilities served by specialist obstetricians/gynecologists. The Sri Lanka College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists plays a leading role by assisting the Family Health Bureau in making policies and guidelines, training staff, and acting as team leaders for maternity care services. This was evident after the tsunami in December 2004. National maternal mortality reviews, monitoring and evaluation of MCH activities, and relatively high contraceptive prevalence rates have also contributed to the success in Sri Lanka, which could serve as a model for other countries. © 2012 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that maternal exposure to acute stress has a negative impact on the duration of pregnancy, and that this effect may vary by the time of exposure. It has also been proposed that stress exposure reduces the ratio of male-to-female births. To date, no study has jointly examined both outcomes, although they may be strongly related. Using population-level data with no selectivity, we jointly study the sex-specific effect of stress on the duration of pregnancy and the observed sex ratio among pregnant women exposed to a major earthquake in Chile. METHODS: In a quasi-experimental design, women exposed to the earthquake in different months of gestation were compared with women pregnant 1 year earlier. Estimates from a comparison group of pregnant women living in areas not affected by the earthquake were also examined to rule out confounding trends. Regression models were used to measure the impact of earthquake exposure on gestational age and preterm birth by sex across month of gestation. A counterfactual simulation was implemented to assess the effect of the earthquake on the secondary sex ratio accounting for the differential impact of stress on gestational age by sex. RESULTS: Earthquake exposure in Months 2 and 3 of gestation resulted in a significant decline in gestational age and increase in preterm delivery. Effects varied by sex, and were much larger for female than male pregnancies. Among females, the probability of preterm birth increased by 0.038 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.005, 0.072] in Month 2 and by 0.039 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.075) in Month 3. Comparable increases for males were insignificant at the conventional P < 0.05 level. After accounting for the sex-specific impact on gestational age, a decline in the male-to-female ratio in Month 3 of exposure was detected [-0.058 (95% CI: -0.113, -0.003)]. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal exposure to an exogenous stressor early but not late in the pregnancy affects gestational age and the probability of preterm birth. This effect is much stronger in females than males. Stress exposure in early pregnancy may also contribute to a decline in the ratio of male-to-female live births in exposed cohorts. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - The multiple nuclear meltdowns at the Fukushima plants beginning on March 11, 2011, are releasing large amounts of airborne radioactivity that has spread throughout Japan and to other nations; thus, studies of contamination and health hazards are merited. In the United States, Fukushima fallout arrived just six days after the earthquake, tsunami, and meltdowns. Some samples of radioactivity in precipitation, air, water, and milk, taken by the U.S. government, showed levels hundreds of times above normal; however, the small number of samples prohibits any credible analysis of temporal trends and spatial comparisons. U.S. health officials report weekly deaths by age in 122 cities, about 25 to 35 percent of the national total. Deaths rose 4.46 percent from 2010 to 2011 in the 14 weeks after the arrival of Japanese fallout, compared with a 2.34 percent increase in the prior 14 weeks. The number of infant deaths after Fukushima rose 1.80 percent, compared with a previous 8.37 percent decrease. Projecting these figures for the entire United States yields 13,983 total deaths and 822 infant deaths in excess of the expected. These preliminary data need to be followed up, especially in the light of similar preliminary U.S. mortality findings for the four months after Chernobyl fallout arrived in 1986, which approximated final figures. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.

AB  - Introduction: An adverse environment in utero, including exposure to prenatal maternal stress (PNMS), can result in poor birth outcomes such as low birth weight, which increases risk of later cardiometabolic diseases such as hypertension and obesity. It is unclear to what extent PNMS influences obesity risk independent of its impact on birth characteristics, especially among humans. Our objective was to determine whether PNMS resulting from a natural disaster influenced risk of childhood obesity. Results: Eight children with high objective PNMS exposure (14.5%) were obese compared to one child (1.8%) with low exposure (P = 0.02). Objective PNMS increased obesity risk (model 1, P = 0.02, odds ratio = 1.37) after controlling for other potential risk factors. Discussion: Results suggest that PNMS might be an independent risk factor in the development of childhood obesity.Methods:Participants included 111 women who were pregnant during the January 1998 Québec Ice Storm or who conceived within the following 3 months and their children. We tested associations between objective and subjective PNMS from the storm and childhood obesity status at age 5, controlling for childrens birth characteristics and breastfeeding status; household socioeconomic status; maternal obstetric complications, life events and smoking during pregnancy, psychological functioning, and height (model 1, n = 111) or BMI (for a subset of 69 participants, model 2).

AB  - The Central American nation of Honduras, one of the hemisphere's poorest countries, faces significant challenges in the areas of crime, human rights, and improving overall economic and living conditions. While traditional agricultural exports of coffee and bananas are still important for the economy, nontraditional sectors, especially the maquiladora, or export-processing industry, have grown significantly over the past decade. Among the country's development challenges are a poverty rate over 60%, high infant mortality, and a significant HIV/AIDS epidemic. Despite these challenges, increased public spending on health and education have reaped significant improvements in development indicators over the past decade. Current President Manuel Zelaya of the Liberal Party won a four-year term in the November 2005 elections. The country has enjoyed 27 years of uninterrupted elected civilian democratic rule. The economy, which grew 6.3% in 2007 and is expected to have grown 4% in 2008, has benefitted from significant debt reduction by the international financial institutions that is freeing government resources to finance poverty-reduction programs. The U.S. recession and global financial crisis, however, are expected to slow Honduran economic growth sharply in 2009. The United States has a close relationship with Honduras, characterized by an important trade partnership, a U.S. military presence in the country, and cooperation on a range of transnational issues. In addition to being a party to the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), Honduras has cooperated extensively with the United States on counternarcotics and port security. Some 78,000 Hondurans living in the United States have been provided temporary protected status (TPS) since the country was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998. U.S. foreign aid to Honduras amounted to $44 million in FY2008 and an estimated $47 million in FY2009. Honduras is also likely to receive a portion of the $105 million in assistance dedicated to Central America in 2009 under the Mérida Initiative, which was designed to boost the region's capabilities to interdict the smuggling of drugs, arms, and people and support a regional anti-gang strategy. For FY2010, the Obama Administration requested over $68 million in assistance for Honduras as well as an additional $100 million for the continuation of the Mérida Initiative in Central America. Beyond traditional foreign assistance, the Millennium Challenge Corporation approved a five-year $215 million compact with Honduras in 2005. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Using three statistical models (GLR, GEP, and GM), the effect of Hurricane Katrina on low birth weight and preterm delivery babies for African American women is examined in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. The study results indicate that risk factors associated with low birth weight and preterm delivery for American African women include unemployment and percent of mothers between the ages of 15-19. Among White women, ages 15-19, risk factors included poverty rate, median household income, and total birth rate. The GMs performed accurate predictions with increasing low birth weight and preterm delivery trends for African American women in the Gulf Coast states and other U.S. states, and decreasing low birth weight and preterm delivery trends for their White counterparts in the same state locations. Data presented between 2007-2010 show low birth weight and preterm delivery for White women as a decreasing tendency while birth outcomes for African American women exhibited a monotonically increasing trend. The empirical findings suggest that health disparities will continue to exist in the foreseeable future, if no effective intervention is taken. The models identify risk factors that contribute to adverse birth outcomes and offer some insight into strategies and programs to address and ameliorate these effects.

AB  - Background: This is the 28th Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' (AAPCC) National Poison Data System (NPDS). All US poison centers upload case data automatically with a median time interval of 19.0 [11.9, 40.6] (median [25%, 75%]) minutes, creating a near real-time national exposure and information database and surveillance system. Methodology: We analyzed the case data tabulating specific indices from NPDS. The methodology was similar to that of previous years. Where changes were introduced, the differences are identified. Poison center cases with medical outcomes of death were evaluated by a team of 33 medical and clinical toxicologist reviewers using an ordinal scale of 1 (Undoubtedly responsible) 6 (Unknown) to determine Relative Contribution to Fatality (RCF) of the exposure to the death. Results: In 2010, 3,952,772 closed encounters were logged by NPDS: 2,384,825, human exposures, 94,823 animal exposures, 1,466,253 information calls, 6537 human confirmed nonexposures, and 334 animal confirmed nonexposures. Total encounters showed a 7.7% decline from 2009 while health care facility calls increased by 2.7%. Human exposures with more serious outcomes (minor, moderate, major or death) increased 4.5% while those with less serious outcomes (all other medical outcome categories) decreased 5.9%. All information calls decreased 12.6% and health care facility (HCF) information calls decreased 13.6%, Drug ID calls decreased 10.9%, and human exposures decreased 3.8%. The top 5 substance classes most frequently involved in all human exposures were analgesics (11.5%), cosmetics/personal care products (7.7%), household cleaning substances (7.3%), sedatives/hypnotics/antipsychotics (6.0%), and foreign bodies/toys/miscellaneous (4.2%). Analgesic exposures as a class increased the most rapidly by 32.8% over the last decade. The top f ve most common exposures in children age 5 years or less were cosmetics/personal care products (13.2%), analgesics (9.4%), household cleaning substances (9.2%), foreign bodies/toys/miscellaneous (7.2%), and topical preparations (6.8%). THC homolog and designer amphetamine ("Bath Salts") exposures were identified as emerging public health threats. Drug identification requests comprised 64.3% of all information calls. NPDS documented 1730 human exposures resulting in death with 1146 human fatalities judged related with an RCF of 1-Undoubtedly responsible, 2-Probably responsible, or 3-Contributory. Conclusions: These data support the continued value of poison center expertise and need for specialized medical toxicology information to manage the more severe exposures, despite a decrease in calls involving less severe exposures. Unintentional and intentional exposures continue to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. The near real-time, always current status of NPDS represents a national public health resource to collect and monitor US exposure cases and information calls. The continuing mission of NPDS is to provide a nationwide infrastructure for public health surveillance for all types of exposures, public health event identification, resilience response and situational awareness tracking. NPDS is a model system for the nation and global public health. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - To investigate the late effects of radiation on child-bearing women, a follow-up study was performed on a 39-year-old survivor 16 years after a 60Co radiation accident. The woman, Fang, was 19 weeks pregnant at the time of exposure. Physical examinations, a full range of clinical laboratory and imaging tests, as well as cytogenetic analyses were conducted to evaluate Fang's current health conditions. Fang shows the appearance of premature ageing and has a decreased menstrual period. Laboratory studies and imaging tests suggest nodular goitre disease and osteoporosis. Otherwise, no apparent abnormalities were found in the major organs. No malignant tumours were detected by either tumour markers or imaging tests. However, the existence of chromosome aberrations warrants long-term follow-up for tumour incidence in the future. Fang became pregnant 8 years after the accident, but suffered a miscarriage due to the death of the foetus at 6 months into the pregnancy. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the intrauterine death of the foetus might be associated with the previous exposure. There is no evidence of malignant tumours as of the date of the follow-up study. Non-cancerous diseases, i.e.thyroid disease and osteoporosis, which may be related to radiation exposure, are the major manifestations of the long-term effects of the accident. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: Previous research suggests that prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) impacts birth outcomes, but many human studies cannot distinguish between the effects of different types of stressors or examine effects of exposure timing on outcomes. Objectives: Our goal was to determine how timing and severity of exposure during pregnancy to objective and subjective stress due to a natural disaster influenced gestation length and fetal growth patterns. Methods: We assessed objective and subjective PNMS levels among 172 women exposed to an ice storm during or shortly before pregnancy. We analyzed associations between PNMS levels and outcomes (gestation length, birth weight, birth length, head circumference, and growth ratios), controlling for other variables such as age, obstetric complications, socioeconomic status, and trait anxiety. Results: Gestation lengths and predicted birth weights were shorter among participants exposed to the ice storm during early to mid pregnancy, compared to 3. rd trimester and pre-pregnancy exposure. Birth lengths were shorter in the sample compared to population references, and predicted values were shorter among participants with a "discrepancy" between their objective and subjective PNMS levels. High objective PNMS levels predicted smaller head circumferences in early pregnancy, but we also observed patterns in predicted values of head circumference to birth length ratios suggesting the sparing of brain development relative to birth length among boys in early pregnancy. These sparing effects decreased in later pregnancy. Conclusions: Exposure to stressful events during pregnancy influences birth outcomes independently of other factors. Exposure timing, newborn sex, and the type of stressor influence the effects observed. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Well-executed knowledge transfer and translation (KT) has become a vital part of effective health management. Following the thalidomide disaster, women and their health care providers became fearful of medications and environmental exposures that could affect the health of the unborn child. Therefore, it is important to disseminate evidenced-based information to pregnant women and their health care providers, enabling them to make empowered decisions regarding exposures during pregnancy. Objectives: The objectives were twofold: (1) to explore the knowledge transfer process of teratology information from the research community to health care providers, pregnant women, and the general public; and (2) to examine how this impacts pregnant women and their health care providers who require this information. Methods: We searched the peer reviewed literature (PUBMED, MEDLINE, and EMBASE), retrieved and examined original studies and review articles, and identified relevant data to evaluate how KT is conducted in this field. Results: We found that KT and teratology information is very complex, with confusing information, over-estimated fears of teratogenicity, as well as unhelpful, often negatively biased information from the media. Of all the methods we identified, Teratogen Information Services (TIS) appears to conduct the most effective KT approaches in this field. Conclusion: It is evident that KT in this area needs improvement. Women and their health care providers are highly impacted by the type of teratology information they receive, affecting for example, deciding to terminate a wanted pregnancy or discontinue a needed pharmacotherapy. When disseminating information in this very sensitive and complex field, it is imperative that good KT strategies are used, encompassing the availability and appropriate interpretation of information. It is most important that an evidence-based decision is made to ensure the optimal outcome for both the mother and her unborn child. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Cleft care is generally characterized by staged, carefully timed surgeries and long-term, team-centered follow-up. Acute and chronic crises can wreak havoc on the comprehensive team care required by children with craniofacial anomalies. In addition, there is evidence that crises, including natural disasters and chronic disruptions, such as political turmoil and poverty, can lead to an increased incidence of craniofacial anomalies. The purpose of this article is to delineate the impact of acute and chronic crises on cleft care. Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2005, resulted in an acute crisis that temporarily disrupted the infrastructure necessary to deliver cleft care; chronic turmoil in the West Bank/Palestine has resulted in an absence of infrastructure to deliver cleft care. Through these central examples, this article will illustrate - through the prism of cleft care - the need for (1) disaster preparedness for acute crises, (2) changing needs following acute crises that may lead to persistent chronic disruption, and (3) baseline and long-term monitoring of population changes after a disaster has disrupted a health care delivery system.

AB  - Background: Mortality has been shown to increase with extremely hot ambient temperatures. Details on the specific cause of mortality can be useful for improving preventive policies. Infants are often identified as a population that is vulnerable to extreme heat conditions; however, information on heat and infant mortality is scarce, with no studies reporting on cause-specific mortality. Methods: The study includes all deaths in the Catalonia region of Spain during the warm seasons of 1983-2006 (503,389 deaths). We used the case-crossover design to evaluate the association between the occurrence of extremely hot days (days with maximum temperature above the 95th percentile) and mortality. Total mortality and infant mortality were stratified into 66 and 8 causes of death, respectively. Results: Three consecutive hot days increased total daily mortality by 19%. We calculated that 1.6% of all deaths were attributable to heat. About 40% of attributable deaths did not occur during heat-wave periods. The causes of death that were increased included cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, mental and nervous system disorders, infectious and digestive system diseases, diabetes, and some external causes such as suicide. In infants, the effect of heat was observed on the same day and was detected only for conditions originating in the perinatal period (relative risk = 1.53 [95% confidence interval = 1.16-2.02]). Within the perinatal causes, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive system, and hemorrhagic and hematologic disorders were the causes of death with stronger effects. Conclusions: Heat contributes to an increase in mortality from several causes. In infants, the first week of life is the most critical window of vulnerability. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Pregnant women may be exposed to a variety of medications that may exert toxic or teratogenic effects on the fetus. Since the thalidomide disaster, physicians and pregnant women tend to withhold medications during pregnancy, although the risk of teratogenic effect from most drugs in therapeutic doses is nonexistent. This chapter will review the principles of teratology and the pharmacoepidemiological evidence for drug safety/risk in human gestation. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Introduction. Surmang, Qinghai Province is a rural nomadic Tibetan region in western China recently devastated by the 2010 Yushu earthquake; little information is available on access and coverage of maternal and child health services. Methods. A cross-sectional household survey was conducted in August 2004. 402 women of reproductive age (15-50) were interviewed regarding their pregnancy history, access to and utilization of health care, and infant and child health care practices. Results: Women's access to education was low at 15% for any formal schooling; adult female literacy was <20%. One third of women received any antenatal care during their last pregnancy. Institutional delivery and skilled birth attendance were <1%, and there were no reported cesarean deliveries. Birth was commonly attended by a female relative, and 8% of women delivered alone. Use of unsterilized instrument to cut the umbilical cord was nearly universal (94%), while coverage for tetanus toxoid immunization was only 14%. Traditional Tibetan healers were frequently sought for problems during pregnancy (70%), the postpartum period (87%), and for childhood illnesses (74%). Western medicine (61%) was preferred over Tibetan medicine (9%) for preventive antenatal care. The average time to reach a health facility was 4.3 hours. Postpartum infectious morbidity appeared to be high, but only 3% of women with postpartum problems received western medical care. 64% of recently pregnant women reported that they were very worried about dying in childbirth. The community reported 3 maternal deaths and 103 live births in the 19 months prior to the survey. Conclusions: While China is on track to achieve national Millennium Development Goal targets for maternal and child health, women and children in Surmang suffer from substantial health inequities in access to antenatal, skilled birth and postpartum care. Institutional delivery, skilled attendance and cesarean delivery are virtually inaccessible, and consequently maternal and infant morbidity and mortality are likely high. Urgent action is needed to improve access to maternal, neonatal and child health care in these marginalized populations. The reconstruction after the recent earthquake provides a unique opportunity to link this population with the health system. © 2011Wellhoner et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The Japanese earthquake and tsunami drew attention worldwide to nuclear power plant accidents and associated health risks. Since Chernobyl 25. years ago, several studies were published and we now have precise information concerning the long-term health of the population living near nuclear power plants and also in different European countries. The authors hope to bring some answers to the key questions from the public concerning radioactive units used and their significance, the evaluation of the number of radio-induced cancers within the different countries of Europe, other eventual health effects and the problem of possible congenital anomalies. Finally, French public perception on nuclear risk is examined and the feedback of the Japanese experience is evoked. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - This article studies the effect of natural disasters on pregnancy outcomes using historical data from the USA. Preterm infants are more likely to be of low birth weight and face increased risk of health problems later in life, implying large long run societal costs. While some of the causes of low birth weight are known, the exact mechanisms leading to prematurity are not well understood. Results confirm that maternal exposure to plausibly exogenous weather events decreases gestational age and birth weight. The negative effects of exposure are particularly strong in the second and early third trimesters of pregnancy, which coincides with the period identified by medical studies as most susceptible to external negative influences. © The Author 2011.

AB  - The ultimate goal of the 'baby plan' is a healthy pregnancy and successful child rearing. Focusing on baby planning, this article covers issues concerning a successful and healthy pregnancy with a psychiatric point of view-the stress and mental health before the pregnancy. According to recent findings, stress influences a women's infertility rate 10 to 15 percent, and a major psychological reason is found to be depression rather than anxiety disorder. The infertility of men is also influenced by stress, based on the research findings that the density and quality of sperm worsens after disasters. Excessive stress before and during pregnancy could result in pre-term labor, small for gestational age infants, or reduced infant weight. In order to prevent these preconception distresses, psychiatric care and treatment are needed. In this regard, Eastern traditional wisdom could be helpful in the view of psychotherapy, since it has been traditionally approved and welcomed for more than a thousand years. One of the insights is that a sound relationship between a husband and wife is a foundation of a good family, and this has already been determined from the moment when the two met for the first time. In conclusion, preconception stress could negatively influence fertility and could have a negative effect on a pregnancy. Thus stress should be alieviated for a healthy pregnancy and successful child rearing by psychotherapeutic intervention. © Korean Medical Association.

AB  - Background: The reproductive and mental health of women contributes significantly to their overall well-being. Three of the eight Millennium Development Goals are directly related to reproductive and sexual health while mental disorders make up three of the ten leading causes of disease burden in low and middle-income countries. Among mental disorders, depression and anxiety are two of the most prevalent. In the context of slower progress in achieving Millennium Development Goals in developing countries and the ever-increasing man-made and natural disasters in these areas, it is important to understand the association between reproductive health and mental health among women with post-disaster experiences. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study with a sample of 387 women of reproductive age (15-49 years) randomly selected from the October 2005 earthquake affected areas of Pakistan. Data on reproductive health was collected using the Centers for Disease Control reproductive health assessment toolkit. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, while earthquake experiences were captured using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. The association of either depression or anxiety with socio-demographic variables, earthquake experiences, reproductive health and access to health facilities was estimated using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Post-earthquake reproductive health events together with economic deprivation, lower family support and poorer access to health care facilities explained a significant proportion of differences in the experiencing of clinical levels of depression and anxiety. For instance, women losing resources for subsistence, separation from family and experiencing reproductive health events such as having a stillbirth, having had an abortion, having had abnormal vaginal discharge or having had genital ulcers, were at significant risk of depression and anxiety. Conclusion: The relationship between women's post-earthquake mental health and reproductive health, socio-economic status, and health care access is complex and explained largely by the socio-cultural role of women. It is suggested that interventions that consider gender differences and that are culturally appropriate are likely to reduce the incidence. © 2011 Anwar et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: This study outlines the evolution of a pediatric field hospital after the January 2010 Haiti earthquake. Methods: Project Medishare set up a field hospital in Port-au-Prince 48 hours after the event. Our institution staffed the pediatric component for 45 days, with sequential deployment of 9 volunteer medical teams. Evolving facility and manpower requirements and changing patient demographics over time were evaluated. Results: Delegations consisted of surgeons, pediatricians, nurses, operating room (OR) personnel, physical therapists, pharmacists, and support staff. Primary goals involved creation of a child-specific ward, pediatric OR, and a wound care center. Major inpatient demographic changes occurred as time from the disaster elapsed. Initial census showed that 93% of the patients were surgical admissions with 40% undergoing operations, mostly fracture and wound care, over the first week. Eight weeks later, medical illnesses accounted for 70% of inpatients, whereas OR volume dropped by more than 50%. A second trend involved increasing acuity of care. Initially, children were admitted for serious or limb-threatening, but usually not life-threatening, injuries. Within 2 months, one third of the patients were housed in the developing NICU/PICU; and only 12% were admitted for injuries related to the earthquake. This change in patient needs led to alterations in facility requirements and in staffing and leadership needs. Conclusion: A disaster involving significant casualties in a populated area demands the rapid development of a field facility with pediatric personnel. Requirements for equipment, manpower, medical records, and systems addressing volunteer stress and ethical dilemmas can be anticipated. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This special article provides an introduction to the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency and Essential Surgical Care (EESC) program. The program was launched by the WHO in December of 2005 to address the lack of adequate surgical capacity as a global public health issue. The overall objective is to reduce death and disability from trauma, burns, pregnancy-related complications, domestic violence, disasters, and other surgically treatable conditions. The program and materials have spread to over 35 countries and focus on providing (1) basic education and training materials; (2) enhancement of surgical infrastructure at the governmental and health facility level; and (3) resources for monitoring and evaluating surgical, obstetrical, and anesthetic capacity. Additionally, a global forum for program members was established that collaborates with ministries of health, WHO country offices, nongovernmental organizations, and academia. The results of the third biennial meeting of global EESC members in Mongolia are outlined as well as future challenges. ©2011 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biotechnology offers a variety of potential benefits and risks. It has enhanced food production by making plants less vulnerable to drought, frost, insects, and viruses and by enabling plants to compete more effectively against weeds for soil nutrients. In a few cases, it has also improved the quality and nutrition of foods by altering their composition. However, the use of biotechnology has also raised concerns about its potential risks to the environment and people. For example, some people fear that common plant pests could develop resistance to the introduced pesticides in GM crops that were supposed to combat them. Genetic engineering provides a means to introduce genes into plants via mechanisms that are different in some respects from classical breeding. A number of commercialized, genetically engineered (GE) varieties, most notably canola, cotton, maize and soybean, were created using this technology, and at present the traits introduced are herbicide and/or pest tolerance. Gene technology enables the increase of production in plants, as well as the rise of resistance to pests, viruses, frost, etc. Gene transfer is used to modify the physical and chemical composition and nutritional value of food. Gene transfer in animals will play a part in boundless possibilities of improving qualitative and quantitative traits. The yield, carcass composition and meat characteristics the use of nutritive substances? not sure what is being said here?, and resistance to diseases can be improved. On the other hand, negative effects of gene technology on animals, human, and environment should be considered. The present review article is the compilation of various studies that present both positive and negative impacts of genetically modified food on human health. © Verma et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.

AB  - Background: Several non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are promoting the use of Artemisia annua teas as a home-based treatment for malaria in situations where conventional treatments are not available. There has been controversy about the effectiveness and safety of this approach, but no pharmacovigilance studies or evaluations have been published to date. Method. A questionnaire about the cultivation of A. annua, treatment of patients, and side-effects observed, was sent to partners of the NGO Anamed in Kenya and Uganda. Some of the respondents were then selected purposively for more in-depth semi-structured interviews. Results: Eighteen partners in Kenya and 21 in Uganda responded. 49% reported difficulties in growing the plant, mainly due to drought. Overall about 3,000 cases of presumed malaria had been treated with A. annua teas in the previous year, of which about 250 were in children and 54 were in women in the first trimester of pregnancy. The commonest problem observed in children was poor compliance due to the bitter taste, which was improved by the addition of sugar or honey. Two miscarriages were reported in pregnant patients. Only four respondents reported side-effects in other patients, the commonest of which was vomiting. 51% of respondents had started using A. annua tea to treat illnesses other than malaria. Conclusions: Local cultivation and preparation of A. annua are feasible where growing conditions are appropriate. Few adverse events were reported even in children and pregnant women. Where ACT is in short supply, it would make sense to save it for young children, while using A. annua infusions to treat older patients who are at lower risk. An ongoing pharmacovigilance system is needed to facilitate reporting of any adverse events. © 2011 Willcox et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - To document changes in birth rates, birth outcomes, and pregnancy risk factors among women giving birth after the 1997 Red River flood in North Dakota. We analyzed detailed county-level birth files pre-disaster (1994-1996) and post-disaster (1997-2000) in North Dakota. Crude birth rates and adjusted fertility rates were calculated. The demographic and pregnancy risk factors were described among women delivering singleton births. Logistic regression was conducted to examine associations between the disaster and low birth weight (<2,500 g), preterm birth (<37 weeks), and small for gestational age infants adjusting for confounders. The crude birth rate and direct-adjusted fertility rate decreased significantly after the disaster in North Dakota. The proportion of women giving birth who were older, non-white, unmarried, and had a higher education increased. Compared to pre-disaster, there were significant increases in the following maternal measures after the disaster: any medical risks (5.1-7.1%), anemia (0.7-1.1%), acute or chronic lung disease (0.4-0.5%), eclampsia (0.3-2.1%), and uterine bleeding (0.3-0.4%). In addition, there was a significant increase in births that were low birth weight (OR 1.11, 95%CI 1.03-1.21) and preterm (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.16) after adjusting for maternal characteristics and smoking. Following the flood, there was an increase in medical risks, low birth weight, and preterm delivery among women giving birth in North Dakota. Further research that examines birth outcomes of women following a catastrophic disaster is warranted. © US Government 2010.

AB  - Drug safety in pregnancy - monitoring congenital anomalies Aim This paper outlines research into the causes of congenital anomalies, and introduces a pan-European study. The potential roles of nurses and midwives in this area are illustrated by a case report. Background Since the thalidomide disaster, use of drugs in pregnancy has been carefully monitored to prevent anything similar happening again. However, monitoring is incomplete and questions remain unanswered. Key issues Many medicines are essential for the health of pregnant women. However, drug use in pregnancy requires surveillance. Methods include spontaneous reporting of adverse events, cohort studies and case control studies. It is hoped that a Europe-wide study, combining data from several congenital anomaly registers, will provide a sufficiently large population to assess the impact of selected drugs on congenital anomalies. However, this work depends on the consistency of reporting by nurses and midwives. Conclusion Drug safety in pregnancy remains undetermined. Collaboration across Europe has the potential to provide a framework for safety evaluation. Implications for nursing management Prescribers should consider the possibility of pregnancy in women of child-bearing age. Careful review of maternal drug use in early pregnancy is essential. Midwives and nurses should be aware of adverse event drug reporting systems, including congenital anomaly registers. © 2011 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To present the latest data that demonstrate how climate change affects children's health and to identify the principal ways in which climate change puts children's health at risk. RECENT FINDINGS: Data continue to emerge that further implicate climate change as contributing to health burdens in children. Climate models have become even more sophisticated and consistently forecast that greenhouse gas emissions will lead to higher mean temperatures that promote more intense storms and droughts, both of which have profound implications for child health. Recent climate models shed light upon the spread of vector-borne disease, including Lyme disease in North America and malaria in Africa. Modeling studies have found that conditions conducive to forest fires, which generate harmful air pollutants and damage agriculture, are likely to become more prevalent in this century due to the effects of greenhouse gases added to earth's atmosphere. SUMMARY: Through many pathways, and in particular via placing additional stress upon the availability of food, clean air, and clean water and by potentially expanding the burden of disease from certain vector-borne diseases, climate change represents a major threat to child health. Pediatricians have already seen and will increasingly see the adverse health effects of climate change in their practices. Because of this, and many other reasons, pediatricians have a unique capacity to help resolve the climate change problem. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Background: The first week of human embryonic development comprises a series of events that change highly specialized germ cells into undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that display an extraordinarily broad developmental potential. The understanding of these events is crucial to the improvement of the success rate of in vitro fertilization. With the emergence of new technologies such as Omics, the gene expression profiling of human oocytes, embryos and hESCs has been performed and generated a flood of data related to the molecular signature of early embryo development. Methods: In order to understand the complex genetic network that controls the first week of embryo development, we performed a systematic review and study of this issue. We performed a literature search using PubMed and EMBASE to identify all relevant studies pub-lished as original articles in English up to March 2010 (n = 165). We also analyzed the transcriptome of human oocytes, embryos and hESCs. Results: Distinct sets of genes were revealed by comparing the expression profiles of oocytes, embryos on Day 3 and hESCs, which are associated with totipotency, pluripotency and reprogramming properties, respectively. Known components of two signaling pathways (WNT and transforming growth factor-b) were linked to oocyte maturation and early embryonic development. Conclusions: Omics analysis provides tools for understanding the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways controlling early embryonic development. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical relevance of using a non-invasive molecular approach to embryo selection for the single-embryo transfer program. © The Author 2010.

AB  - After epidemic cholera emerged in Haiti in October 2010, the disease spread rapidly in a country devastated by an earthquake earlier that year, in a population with a high proportion of infant deaths, poor nutrition, and frequent infectious diseases such as HIV infection, tuberculosis, and malaria. Many nations, multinational agencies, and nongovernmental organizations rapidly mobilized to assist Haiti. The US government provided emergency response through the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance of the US Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This report summarizes the participation by the Centers and its partners. The efforts needed to reduce the spread of the epidemic and prevent deaths highlight the need for safe drinking water and basic medical care in such difficult circumstances and the need for rebuilding water, sanitation, and public health systems to prevent future epidemics.

AB  - This chapter describes how globally human health is adversely influenced by exposure to toxic chemicals that act as endocrine disruptors. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute a large generic group of organic compounds with two or more fused aromatic rings. Exposure to this contributes to the declining fertility in men and women, which is discussed in detail here. Exclusive sources for B(a)P contamination of the environment and exposure to humans include industrial and automobile emissions, hazardous waste sites, cigarette smoke, biomass burning, municipal incinerators, volcanic eruptions, home heating and consumption of charcoal broiled and smoked foods. Vulnerable organs such as the gonads are exposed directly to inhaled B(a)P. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals may have very specific effects on the cells within the ovary and because of the intense interdependency of cells in this organ, cause a disruption in normal folliculogenesis, ovulatory process, fertilization and subsequent embryo development. The nervous system, liver, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts and cardiovascular system are all targets for PAHs' adverse effects. Transplacental exposures of fetuses to PAHs affect fetal development and pregnancy outcomes in both laboratory animals and humans. The sexual maturation and growth of the female organs are under estrogen regulation and B(a)P-induced reduction of estrogen secretion at puberty leads to delay in these processes. Furthermore, in addition to the growth effects estrogen has on the uterine and oviductal musculature, it plays a major role in the development of the endometrial lining. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons have been known to cause DNA damage both in laboratory animals and humans. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - To describe factors associated with inpatient mortality in a field hospital established following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Data were abstracted from medical records of patients admitted to the University of Miami Global Institute/Project Medishare hospital. Decedents were compared to survivors in terms of age, sex, length of stay, admission ward, diagnosis, and where relevant, injury mechanism and surgical procedure. Three multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to determine predictors of death among all patients, injured patients, and noninjured patients. During the study period, 1,339 patients were admitted to the hospital with 100 inpatient deaths (7.5 percent). The highest proportion of deaths occurred among patients aged < or = 15 years. Among all patients, adult intensive care unit (ICU) admission (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 7.6 and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.4-16.8), neonatal ICU/pediatric ICU (NICU/PICU) admission (AOR = 7.8 and 95% CI = 2.7-22.9), and cardiac/respiratory diagnoses (AOR = 8.5 and 95% CI = 4.9-14.8) were significantly associated with death. Among injured patients, adult ICU admission (AOR = 7.4 and 95% CI = 1.7-33.3) and penetrating injury (AOR = 3.3 and 95% CI = 1.004-11.1) were significantly associated with death. Among noninjured patients, adult ICU admission (AOR = 6.6 and 95% CI = 2.7-16.4), NICU/PICU admission (AOR = 8.2 and 95% CI = 2.1-31.8), and cardiac/ respiratory diagnoses (AOR = 6.5 and 95% CI = 3.6-12.0) were significantly associated with death. Following earthquakes in resource-limited settings, survivors may require care in field hospitals for injuries or exacerbation of chronic medical conditions. Planning for sustained post-earthquake response should address these needs and include pediatric-specific preparation and long-term critical care requirements.

AB  - The social and sanitary indicators reflects the political instability and the economic deficiencies from which Haiti suffers, for example an important indicator of development underlines the sanitary deficiencies of the country : infant mortality quotient reaches 86 for 1000 births ; in other words, approximately a child on twelve dies before reaching the age of five years. In such conditions, the arisen of the epidemic of cholera in October 2010, besides the chaotic period post-earthquake, can only plunge the country into a totally muddled sanitary situation. The geographical approach which follows applies to appreciate the impact of the infection in the space, in several scales of observation, and to recognize the spatial discontinuities of prevalency and incidence. The objective is then to understand the laws which govern the differences of impact and evolution observed, by identifying the territorialization of the healthcare access in the Haitian space. In fine, the progressive seizure of power of the actors of the international assistance in the field of the health raises the problem of the breathlessness of the Haitian health services in favour of the private sector, a break which the current sanitary crisis was only aggravating.

AB  - The maternal mortality ratio is an important indicator of socioeconomic conditions in a country or area. This study in Kerman province aimed to compare maternal mortality ratios from different data sources and examine deficiencies in vital data collection in the Islamic Republic of Iran in the context of the Bam earthquake disaster (December 2003). Annual data were collected from documents before and after the earthquake and interviews were conducted with key informants. There was a large difference in maternal mortality ratios in the year of the earthquake and the year after the earthquake comparing the 2 main data sources (the family unit under the supervision of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and the civil registry under the supervision of the Ministry of Interior). The reasons for this are discussed. This study also highlighted problems in collaboration between international aid agencies that hindered routine data collection.

AB  - A growing body of research highlights that in utero conditions are consequential for individual outcomes throughout the life cycle, but research assessing causal processes is scarce. This article examines the effect of one such condition-prenatal maternal stress-on birth weight, an early outcome shown to affect cognitive, educational, and socioeconomic attainment later in life. Exploiting a major earthquake as a source of acute stress and using a difference-in-difference methodology, I find that maternal exposure to stress results in a significant decline in birth weight and an increase in the proportion of low birth weight. This effect is focused on the first trimester of gestation, and it is mediated by reduced gestational age rather than by factors affecting the intrauterine growth of term infants. The findings highlight the relevance of understanding the early emergence of unequal outcomes and of investing in maternal well-being since the onset of pregnancy. © 2011 Population Association of America.

AB  - Introduction: This paper is a report of a qualitative study of emergency and critical care nurses' perceptions of occupational response and preparedness during infectious respiratory disease outbreaks including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza. Problem: Healthcare workers, predominantly female, face occupational and personal challenges in their roles as first responders/first receivers. Exposure to SARS or other respiratory pathogens during pregnancy represents additional occupational risk for healthcare workers. Methods: Perceptions of occupational reproductive risk during response to infectious respiratory disease outbreaks were assessed qualitatively by five focus groups comprised of 100 Canadian nurses conducted between 2005 and 2006. Results: Occupational health and safety issues anticipated by Canadian nurses for future infectious respiratory disease outbreaks were grouped into four major themes: (1) apprehension about occupational risks to pregnant nurses; (2) unknown pregnancy risks of anti-infective therapy/prophylaxis; (3) occupational risk communication for pregnant nurses; and (4) human resource strategies required for pregnant nurses during outbreaks. The reproductive risk perceptions voiced by Canadian nurses generally were consistent with reported case reports of pregnant women infected with SARS or emerging influenza strains. Nurses' fears of fertility risks posed by exposure to infectious agents or anti-infective therapy and prophylaxis are not well supported by the literature, with the former not biologically plausible and the latter lacking sufficient data. Conclusions: Reproductive risk assessments should be performed for each infectious respiratory disease outbreak to provide female healthcare workers and in particular pregnant women with guidelines regarding infection control and use of anti-infective therapy and prophylaxis. © World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine 2011.

AB  - Over the past 50 years, Japan has successfully developed and maintained an increasingly equitable system of universal health coverage in addition to achieving the world's highest life expectancy and one of the lowest infant mortality rates. Against this backdrop, Japan is potentially in a position to become a leading advocate for and supporter of global health. Nevertheless, Japan's engagement with global health has not been outstanding relative to its substantial potential, in part because of government fragmentation, a weak civil society, and lack of transparency and assessment. Japan's development assistance for health, from both governmental and non-governmental sectors, has remained low and Japanese global health leadership has been weak. New challenges arising from changes in governance and global and domestic health needs, including the recent Great East Japan Earthquake, now provide Japan with an opportunity to review past approaches to health policy and develop a new strategy for addressing global and national health. The fragmented functioning of the government with regards to global health policy needs to be reconfigured and should be accompanied by further financial commitment to global health priorities, innovative non-governmental sector initiatives, increased research capacity, and investments in good leadership development as witnessed at the G8 Hokkaido Toyako Summit. Should this strategy development and commitment be achieved, Japan has the potential to make substantial contributions to the health of the world as many countries move toward universal coverage and as Japan itself faces the challenge of maintaining its own health system. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The New York City terrorist attacks on Sept 11, 2001 (9/11), killed nearly 2800 people and thousands more had subsequent health problems. In this Review of health effects in the short and medium terms, strong evidence is provided for associations between experiencing or witnessing events related to 9/11 and post-traumatic stress disorder and respiratory illness, with a correlation between prolonged, intense exposure and increased overall illness and disability. Rescue and recovery workers, especially those who arrived early at the World Trade Center site or worked for longer periods, were more likely to develop respiratory illness than were other exposed groups. Risk factors for post-traumatic stress disorder included proximity to the site on 9/11, living or working in lower Manhattan, rescue or recovery work at the World Trade Center site, event-related loss of spouse, and low social support. Investigators note associations between 9/11 exposures and additional disorders, such as depression and substance use; however, for some health problems association with exposures related to 9/11 is unclear. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Problem statement: Climate change and its associated manifestations have only recently emerged as significant threats to health faced by Canadians. The emergence of these threats has meant that Canadians are faced with increasing health-related concerns that are more frequent, more severe and occurring in communities where they have not been previously experienced. The compounding effects of change in weather patterns in communities that are heavily dependent on natural conditions for their agronomical performance could be quite severe on the mental health of farmers and other rural dwellers. Approach: Existing literature was identified for their critical review through a comprehensive serach by using web-based publications, data-base and other archival sources. Specific relevant studies were then analysed with directions for addressing the emerging psychosocial problems. An emphasis was given to the shifting nature of treament from hospital-based supports to community-based social supports. Results: In perspective of recent developments in Canada, the study offers a critical assessment of psychosocial aspects of climate change-induced extreme environmental events. In recent decades, community-based approaches and other micro-level social action interventions have gained acceptance by the concerned institutions. However, institutional supports to enhance commuity level capacity are still meager. As to identify appropriate tools, lessons for improving present systems can be drawn from the Community Emergency Response Volunteer (CERV) programs. Such tools can enhance psychosocial coping abilities through strengthening social support and enhancing the community coping capacity. Conclusion: Psychosocial effects of climate change-induced stress should be addressed from the perspective of 'model of prevention' rathern than the prevailing 'model of treatment'. Instituional changes are required to enhance the required social ties and community capacity to mitigate and cope with the psychosocial stress that disasters cause. © 2011 Science Publications.

AB  - Background. The terrorist explosions of the World Trade Center in New York City and the other events on the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania on 11 September 2001 were stressful events that affected people around the world. Pregnant women and their offspring are especially vulnerable during and after such a terrorist attack. The objective was to systematically review the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes after the terrorist attacks on Sept 11, 2001. Methods. The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) criteria were used for reporting of this review. Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.0. Results. Ten reports of low-to-moderate risk of methodological bias were included. There was increased risks of infants with birthweight of 1,500 g-1,999 g (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.67 [95%CI 1.11-2.52]) and small-for-gestational age births (AOR 1.90; 95%CI 1.05-3.46) in New York. There was increased risks of low birthweight (relative risk 2.25; 95%CI 1.29-3.90) and preterm births (relative risk 1.50; 95%CI 1.06-2.14) among ethnically Arabic women living in California There was a reduction in birthweight by 276 g and in head circumference by 1 cm when DNA adducts, a marker for environmental toxin exposure, were doubled in maternal blood. In Holland, a 48-g reduction in birthweight was reported. Conclusions. The World Trade Center disaster influenced pregnancy outcomes in New York, among ethnically Arab women living in California and among Dutch women. The adverse outcomes are likely due to environmental pollution and stress in New York, ethnic harassment in California and communal bereavement and stress in Holland. © 2010 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

AB  - Hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death. Pregnant woman can tolerate a larger amount of blood loss than non-pregnant woman, but obstetric hemorrhage is characterized by a high incidence of coagulopathy. The Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists and four related academic societies published "Guidelines for management of critical bleeding in obstetrics" in April 2010. The following points are emphasized in these guidelines. Firstly, the trend of the shock index (heart rate/systolic blood pressure) is useful to evaluate the necessity for blood transfusion. Secondly, coagulopathy should be evaluated in a timely manner and treated promptly, when blood loss including amniotic fluid exceeds 2,000 ml. Thirdly, an urgency code for hemorrhage should be introduced to facilitate communication among the related personnel with communication between the delivery/operating room and blood transfusion service. According to a triage tag in disaster medicine, code I or code red is an extreme emergency : overt hemorrhagic shock or evident massive hemorrhage. If code I is declared by the designated commander, transfusion of uncross-matched ABO-identical as well as ABO-compatible, non-identical red blood cells should be considered, if time is short or ABO-identical red blood cells are unavailable. The commander is selected from senior physicians of the anesthesiology or the obstetric department, and is responsible for crisis management. The major problems in crisis management are hesitation to declare an emergency and failure of communication. Declaration of an emergency is also essential for calling supportive medical personnel. To deal rapidly with critical bleeding, hospital actions to be taken should be prepared, and simulation exercise should be performed to correct inappropriate actions prior to an actual crisis. A systematic, not individual, approach is required to save the life of a bleeding pregnant woman.

AB  - In this work occurs the relationship between some productive parameters and classification of bovine carcasses of Venezuela and the European Union, for Brahman males castrated to birth, their own environment in intensive system in the Llano Venezuelan, depending on your time of birth (dry or wet), as well as the relationship between the two systems. It was controlled weight at birth, weight and age at weaning, weight and age to slaughter, weight during the fattening and the performance gain carcass, 1478 castrated to the birth of Brahman, 750 males born between the months of June and July (rainy season) and 728 born between the months of January and February (time of drought). All the carcasses were classified according to the Venezuelan system and the European Union for bovine animals. The effect of the time of birth influenced significantly the growth of animals, although there was no difference in the weight at birth, if there was at weaning weight (194.14 vs. 177.55) and the slaughter (503.17 vs. 493.01), for those born in dry season. The time of birth did not influence the classification of carcasses, finding AA-optimal class according to the Venezuelan system, E-excellent and U-very well for the EU to the conformation and good fat content (3-covered) according to the system of the EU system carcass. Regardless of the time of birth, it was found for both, the Venezuelan and EU classification, greater slaughter weight as well as higher gain weight and killing out percentage involved positively with superior carcasses ratings. Found a high correlation between the Venezuelan system and the EU (0.92 for conformation and 0.94 for fat content), in both times of birth, so that better classified carcasses as Venezuela system they are also best classifications according to the EU system.

AB  - Mankind had long dreamed that once any country's economic growth "take off" starts, people would be liberated from all traditional disasters such as poverty, famine, pandemic, and infant deaths. However, recent developments in the most economically advanced countries such as US, EU, and Japan indicate that those developed countries get into Limbo rather than the promised paradise, mainly due to aging and shrinking population. Through the case study on Japan, the author examines feasible solutions to the world which will face the same destiny soon.

AB  - Orissa accounts for 95 percent of the chromium ore reserves of India. It increases the economic status, but adversely reduces the ecological cover. Chromite mines generate considerable quantity of pollutants containing toxic hexavalent chromium, a known carcinogen, which contaminates 10 to 4000 mg/kg (ppm) of total chromium in air, water and soil environment. Surface water and ground water in Sukinda region contain hexavent chromium Cr(VI), well above the permissible limits of 0.05 mg/l (ppm). There are clusters of chromite mines release considerable quantity of effluents and slurries, as well as the over burden stockpiles as hazardous wastes. These are discharged into various tributaries of the Brahmani river. Suspended and respirable particulate matter were found well above the prescribed limit of 100 μg/m3. Chromium based diseases among the workers have been found which could be a result of the intake of excessive Cr(VI). Chromite mine workers, who were constantly exposed to contaminated dust and water, report gastrointestinal bleeding, tuberculosis and asthma besides incidence of infertility, birth defects and still births. They suffer from chromium based diseases such as chromium poisoning, ulcer, allergic dermatitis, lung cancer, lever necrosis, brain damage, premature death, lever and kidney problems. It is important that these mines have to initiate regulatory measures to control this unsafe chromium pollution. It is required to get treated this mine water using chromium effluent treatment plants (CETP) as well as to get evolved preventive and control strategies at the planning stages itself as prevention is better than cure, very little or nothing can be done if the toxic chromium reaches the air, water and soil environment. It has been observed that the management of chromite mines have not implemented the worker's compensation law and occupational diseases law. As per the present research work conducted, it has been proved that approximately 80 percent of mining disasters are preventable provided that these laws get enforced efficiently. It is necessary that the mine workers must follow adequate safety compliances. The present study has been done to present the research investigations pertaining to environmental health effects of Orissa chromite mines.

AB  - Objective In spite of the many benefits of industrialization and modern food systems, today's nutrition and growth practices have become self destructive and have promoted the obesity epidemic. Current methods for dealing with this epidemic are not working, and a different approach is proposed based on a variety of findings. The objective of the paper is to stimulate leaders in health and medicine to consider a different view for reducing the obesity epidemic and chronic diseases. Methods A systems approach was followed to examine the health ramifications of nutritional practices, childhood growth, and the secular increase height and weight. Over 5,000 research papers and reports were reviewed. The highlights of data pointing to a different approach to human diet and physical development are summarized. Results Much evidence indicates that a plant -based diet that avoids increased birth weight, rapid growth, and tall stature is the best approach to avoid an overweight and obese population. Western nutrition and greater height have been major factors in promoting obesity and chronic diseases. Evidence from the Great Depression, famines, studies on calorie restricted diets, and data on long-lived people indicates that avoiding excessive animal protein and calories sharply reduces the risk of obesity and increases healthy longevity. Failure to manage the obesity epidemic will lead to economic disaster as medical care costs exceed many trillions of dollars a year. Conclusion During the last 60 years, the Western diet and promotion of rapid childhood growth have yielded the fattest population in human history. However, a life long program that focuses on plant foods, avoids high-calorie processed foods and implements portion control offers the best approach for Western countries to correct this problem and for non-Western countries to avoid repeating the mistakes of the West. Moderate birth weight, later sexual maturation and slower growth in stature and weight are important steps to minimize obesity, health problems and related economic costs.

AB  - Background. The empirical literature on the effects of disaster on pregnancy and the postpartum period is limited. The objective of this review was to examine the existing evidence on the effect of disasters on perinatal health. Methods. A systematic review was conducted by searching electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cinahl, PsycInfo), including literature on disasters and pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital anomalies), mental health, and child development. A total of 110 articles were identified, but many published reports were anecdotes or recommendations rather than systematic studies. The final review included 49 peer-reviewed studies that met inclusion criteria. Results. Studies addressing the World Trade Center disaster of September 11 and other terrorist attacks, environmental/chemical disasters, and natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes were identified. Disasters of various types may reduce fetal growth in some women, although there does not appear to be an effect on gestational age at birth. Severity of exposure is the major predictor of mental health issues among pregnant and postpartum women. After a disaster, mental health of the mother may more strongly influence on child development than any direct effect of disaster-related prenatal stress. Conclusions. There is evidence that disaster impacts maternal mental health and some perinatal health outcomes, particular among highly exposed women. Future research should focus on understudied outcomes such as spontaneous abortion. Relief workers and clinicians should concentrate on the most exposed women, particularly with respect to mental health. Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists Learning Objectives: After completion of this educational activity, the obstetrician/gynecologist should be better able to compare and contrast the effects of different types of disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, chemical spills) on pregnant and postpartum women in order to prepare for patient care in the aftermath of such disasters; differentiate the birth outcomes likely to be affected by disaster, in order to identify patients likely to be at high risk; and assess the extent to which pregnant and postpartum women are a uniquely vulnerable population after disaster, to assist in organizing care under such circumstances.

AB  - Although the future of pediatrics is uncertain, the organizations that lead pediatrics, and the professionals who practice within it, have embraced the notion that the pediatric community must anticipate and lead change to ultimately improve the health of children and adolescents. In an attempt to proactively prepare for a variety of conceivable futures, the board of directors of the American Academy of Pediatrics established the Vision of Pediatrics 2020 Task Force in 2008. This group was charged to think broadly about the future of pediatrics, to gather input on key trends that are influencing the future, to create likely scenarios of the future, and to recommend strategies to best prepare pediatric clinicians and pediatric organizations for a range of potential futures. The work of this task force led to the development of 8 "megatrends" that were identified as highly likely to have a profound influence on the future of pediatrics. A separate list of "wild-card" scenarios was created of trends with the potential to have a substantial influence but are less likely to occur. The process of scenario-planning was used to consider the effects of the 8 megatrends on pediatrics in the year 2020 and beyond. Consideration of these possible scenarios affords the opportunity to determine potential future pediatric needs, to identify potential solutions to address those needs, and, ultimately, to proactively prepare the profession to thrive if these or other future scenarios become realities.

AB  - The worst chemical industrial disaster occurred in Bhopal, India at a pesticide plant on the night of 2-3 December 1984 killing approximately 2500 people immediately and many more subsequently as a consequence of the toxic effects of the methyl isocyanate released from the plant. The main toxic effects were observed on the lungs, the eyes and on reproductive health. A wide spectrum of lung diseases varying from obstructive airways disease to interstitial lung fibrosis has been reported to occur in the gas-exposed subjects, many of them leading life as respiratory cripples. Corneal opacities and early onset cataracts in younger populations were also observed. There was a high incidence of spontaneous abortions and still-births in gas-exposed pregnant women and there were also significantly higher perinatal and neonatal mortalities in the affected areas. Many gas-exposed individuals suffered from psychiatric disorders. There is inadequate compensation to the victims considering the severity of the recognised consequences of the disaster. The punishment meted out to the guilty can be considered trivial in relation to the adverse human outcomes. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Logistic regression and spatial analytic techniques are used to model fetal distress risk as a function of maternal exposure to Hurricane Andrew. First, monthly time series compare the proportion of infants born distressed in hurricane affected and unaffected areas. Second, resident births are analyzed in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, before, during, and after Hurricane Andrew. Third, resident births are analyzed in all Florida locales with 100,000 or more persons, comparing exposed and unexposed gravid females. Fourth, resident births are analyzed along Hurricane Andrew's path from southern Florida to northeast Mississippi. Results show that fetal distress risk increases significantly with maternal exposure to Hurricane Andrew in second and third trimesters, adjusting for known risk factors. Distress risk also correlates with the destructive path of Hurricane Andrew, with higher incidences of fetal distress found in areas of highest exposure intensity. Hurricane exposed African-American mothers were more likely to birth distressed infants. The policy implications of-in utero-costs of natural disaster exposure are discussed. © 2010 Society for Risk Analysis.

AB  - Objective: To examine how the demographic and other population changes affected birth and obstetric outcomes in Louisiana, and the effect of the hurricane on racial disparities in these outcomes. Methods: Vital statistics data were used to compare the incidence of low birth weight (LBW) (<2500 g), preterm birth (PTB) (37 weeks' gestation), cesarean section, and inadequate prenatal care (as measured by the Kotelchuck index), in the 2 years after Katrina compared to the 2 years before, for the state as a whole, region 1 (the area around New Orleans), and Orleans Parish (New Orleans). Logistic models were used to adjust for covariates. Results: After adjustment, rates of LBW rose for the state, but preterm birth did not. In region 1 and Orleans Parish, rates of LBW and PTB remained constant or fell. These patterns were all strongest in African American women. Rates of cesarean section and inadequate prenatal care rose. Racial disparities in birth outcomes remained constant or were reduced. Conclusions: Although risk of LBW/PTB remained higher in African Americans, the storm does not appear to have exacerbated health disparities, nor did population shifts explain the changes in birth and obstetric outcomes. ©2010 American Medical Association.

AB  - Objectives: The health effects of chronic low-dose radiation exposure remains a controversial question. Monitoring after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine suggested that chronic low-dose radiation exposure was not linked to cancer mortality among the general population. However, elevated rates of birth defects in contaminated compared to uncontaminated regions suggest that exposure to radiation in utero might impact development and that chronic radiation exposure might represent an underestimated risk to human health. Methods: We sought to determine current radiation exposure routes in Rivne-Polissia, a region of Ukraine contaminated by the Chernobyl accident. This represents a first step toward comprehensive studies of the effects of chronic radiation exposure on human health. We designed and administered a dietary and activity survey to 344 women in Polissia. We assessed types and sources of food consumed, types of outdoor activities, and alcohol intake. Results: Alcohol intake was low and alone does not account for the observed high rates of birth defects. Wild foods, especially mushrooms and berries, and locally produced foods, especially milk related, were major radiation exposure routes. Additionally, women were exposed to radiation through inhalation while burning grasses and potato vines in fields, and wood for cooking and heating. Conclusions:Twenty four years after the Chernobyl accident, women continue to be chronically exposed to low-dose radiation at levels exceeding current recommendations. This might contribute (especially synergistically with alcohol consumption and micronutrient deficiencies) to higher prevalence of birth defects in areas of Ukraine with high levels of radiation contamination compared to uncontaminated areas. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: The Noto Peninsula earthquake struck the coast of the Noto Peninsula, Japan on March 25, 2007, resulting in the death of one woman and injury to 356 people. A total of 684 houses were totally destroyed by this earthquake, and more than 2,500 people were forced to live at shelters. In this study, we have evaluated the association between the incidence of peripartum abnormalities and seismic intensity of the Noto Peninsula earthquake. Methods: Demographic data, births, seismic intensity of the earthquake and the incidence of peripartum abnormalities between June 25, 2007 and January 31, 2008 were surveyed. The dataset included 126 pregnant women who lived in the disaster area. The seismic intensity of the earthquake was expressed on the scale (0-7, with 7 being the strongest measure) used by the Japan Meteorological Agency. The subjects of the analysis included 19.7% of the pregnant women affected by the disaster. Results: Of the pregnant women included in this study, 7.9% had a premature rupture of membranes (PROM), with the percentage being significantly higher in the group that experienced a seismic intensity of 6 than in that experienced a seismic intensity of 5. Conclusions: Our epidemiologic study shows that the PROM among our study cohort was associated with seismic intensity, suggesting that the physical outcome was due to aftershocks of the earthquake at a seismic intensity ≥6. This outcome may result from the psychological stress caused by the earthquakes. © 2010 The Japanese Society for Hygiene.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic of 2009 H1N1 swine-origin influenza A has heightened the world's attention to the reality of influenza pandemics and their unpredictable nature. Currently, the 2009 H1N1 influenza strain appears to cause mild clinical disease for the majority of those infected. However, the risk of severe disease from this strain or other future strains remains an ongoing concern and is noted in specific patient populations. Pregnant women represent a unique patient population that historically has been disproportionately affected by both seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks. Data thus far suggest that the current 2009 H1N1 outbreak is following this same epidemiologic tendency among pregnant women. The increased predilection to worse clinical outcomes among pregnant women has potential to produce an acute demand for critical care resources that may overwhelm supply in facilities providing maternity care. The ability of healthcare systems to optimize maternal-child health outcomes during an influenza pandemic or other biologic disaster may therefore depend on the equitable allocation of these limited resources. Triage algorithms for resource allocation have been delineated in the general medical population. However, no current guidance considers the unique aspects of pregnant women and their unborn fetuses. An approach is suggested that may help guide facilities faced with these challenges. © 2010 BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - To investigate temperament in infants whose mothers were exposed to Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, and to determine if high hurricane exposure is associated with difficult infant temperament. A prospective cohort study of women giving birth in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, LA (n = 288) in 2006-2007 was conducted. Questionnaires and interviews assessed the mother's experiences during the hurricane, living conditions, and psychological symptoms, 2 months and 12 months postpartum. Infant temperament characteristics were reported by the mother using the activity, adaptability, approach, intensity, and mood scales of the Early Infant and Toddler Temperament Questionnaires, and quot;difficult temperament" was defined as scoring in the top quartile for three or more of the scales. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between hurricane experience, mental health, and infant temperament. Serious experiences of the hurricane did not strongly increase the risk of difficult infant temperament (association with three or more serious experiences of the hurricane: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-3.58 at 2 months; 0.58, 0.15-2.28 at 12 months). Maternal mental health was associated with report of difficult infant temperament, with women more likely to report having a difficult infant temperament at 1 year if they had screened positive for PTSD (aOR 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-5.41), depression, (aOR 3.16, 95% CI 1.22-8.20) or hostility (aOR 2.17, 95% CI 0.81-5.82) at 2 months. Large associations between maternal stress due to a natural disaster and infant temperament were not seen, but maternal mental health was associated with reporting difficult temperament. Further research is needed to determine the effects of maternal exposure to disasters on child temperament, but in order to help babies born in the aftermath of disaster, the focus may need to be on the mother's mental health.

AB  - This study was designed to analyze the effect of environmental oxidative stress on human placental monooxygenases, glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-DNA adducts in human term placentas from radioactivity-contaminated and chemically-polluted areas of the Ukraine and Belarus, and to compare these biomarkers to the newborn's general health status. Placental PAH-DNA adduct formation, GST activity, 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase (ECOD) activity, and thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS), an index of lipid peroxidation, were measured in groups of women exposed to different levels of radioactivity and PAH pollution. The in vitro metabolism data, obtained from 143 human placental samples at term, were compared to indices of maternal and newborn health. The highest ECOD activity was recorded in placentas obtained from chemically-polluted areas and a radioactivity-contaminated area; the ECOD activity was 7-fold and 2-fold higher compared to the region considered to be " clean" Newborns with the most compromised health status displayed the greatest down-regulation of GST activity (144-162mUmgprotein-1 vs. 258-395mUmgprotein-1), enhanced ECOD activity and the highest level of PAH-DNA adduct formation. The highest level of TBARS was observed in women exposed to the highest levels of radiation. The efficiency of placental detoxification negatively correlated with maternal age and the health status of the newborn. Environmental oxidative stress was related to an increase in anemia, threatened abortions, toxemia, fetal hypoxia, spontaneous abortions and fetal hypotrophy. Our data suggest that chemically- or radioactivity-induced oxidative stress enhance cytochrome P450-mediated enzymatic activities potentially resulting in increased formation of reactive metabolites. The activity of GSH-transferase is not enhanced. This imbalance in detoxification capacity can be measured as increased production of PAH-DNA adducts, decreased lipid peroxidation and compromised fetal health. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Cot death is a generic term for sudden, unexpected and unexplained death in infancy. It has numerous causes. More than 10,000 such deaths could be prevented in Germany over the past 20 years by changing infant sleeping conditions ("back position in a sleeping bag"). The body of knowledge which has been gathered and confirmed in epidemiological studies needs to be transferred to all future generations of parents in order to prevent a repetition of the disaster which occurred after the introduction of the "well-meant fashion"of the prone sleeping position. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

AB  - Emergency plans that specifically address the needs of women, infants, and children during disasters are currently underdeveloped in the United States. Pregnant women, infants, and children are adversely affected by disasters resulting in an increased number of infants with intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, and a small head circumference. There is an increased incidence of preterm delivery. To provide for a healthy pregnancy and delivery, pregnant women affected by disasters need to be assured of a continuation of prenatal care. Those in the third trimester should be aware of established local health care facilities that can provide prenatal care and obstetric services during a disaster. © 2010 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Background. The secondary sex ratio (i.e., the odds of a male birth) reportedly declines following natural disasters, pollution events, and economic collapse. It remains unclear whether this decline results from an excess of male fetal loss or reduced male conceptions. The literature also does not converge as to whether the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 induced "communal bereavement", or the widespread feeling of distress among persons who never met those directly involved in the attacks. We test the communal bereavement hypothesis among gravid women by examining whether male fetal deaths rose above expected levels in the US following September 11, 2001. Methods. We apply interrupted time-series methods to all fetal deaths at or greater than the 20th week of gestation in the US from 1996 to 2002. Time-series methods control for trends, seasonality, and other forms of autocorrelation that could induce spurious associations. Results. Results support the hypothesis in that the fetal death sex ratio (i.e., the odds of a male fetal death) increased above its expected value in September 2001. Additional analysis of the secondary sex ratio indirectly supports that the terrorist attacks may have threatened the gestation of male more than female fetuses. Conclusions. Societal responses to events such as September 11, 2001 do not appear confined only to persons who have ever met the deceased. The fetal death sex ratio in the US population may serve as a sentinel indicator of the degree to which pregnant women react to population stressors. © 2010 Bruckner et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The Chernobyl nuclear accident happened in the former Soviet Union on 26 April 1986. The accident destroyed one of the RBMK-1000 type reactors and released significant radioactive contamination into the environment. At first the emissions were transported north-westwards over Poland, the Baltic States, Finland, Sweden and Norway. During 27 April 1986 emissions were spreading to eastern-central Europe, southern Germany, Italy and Yugoslavia. Radioactivity mapping over Finland between 29 April and 16 May 1986 showed that the ground deposition in Finland covered southern and central parts of the country but had an irregular distribution. The highest (over 100 μR h-1 [1 μSv h-1]) contamination disclosed by the mapping was around the city of Uusikaupunki in western Finland and the city of Kotka in southeastern Finland. The Uusikaupunki region was an area of heavy fallout associated with the air mass that was located in the Chernobyl area at the time of the accident. The fallout pattern of reftractory nuclides, e.g. plutonium isotopes, had their spatial maximum in this region. Medical consequences in Finland were luckily mild, the most important symptoms being psychological ones. No increase in thyroid cancer or birth defect occurrence has been observed. The Chernobyl accident boosted the radioecological research which had already been calming down after the last atmospheric nuclear test in China in October 1980. Important new results concerning e.g. hot particles have been achieved. The most important effects of the accident in Finland were, however, the increase of public awareness of environmental issues in general and especially of nuclear energy. In Finland, the nuclear energy programme was halted until 2002 when the Parliament of Finland granted a licence to build the fifth nuclear reactor in Finland. © 2010.

AB  - In the world every day, every minute, and in most cases in developing countries, a mother dies from a complication related to pregnancy, childbirth or puerperium. This death is more tham just a personal or family tragedy; she encourages us to take active participation. It is known that this sad event implies a high socio-economic burden for the state, community and family, with invaluable consecuences. The magnitude of this disaster rises to an annual loss of 600 thousand mothers also about 50 million cases with injuries derive from this, both are substantially preventable. Three decades of research have proven that implementing small and feasible measures can significantly reduce the health risks that women face during the pregnancy. The quality of life and health services can be evaluated by two key indicators: maternal and perinatal mortality. Global agents multilateral institutions have been organized to address this unacceptable reality health, particularly in developing countries a profound analysis and has taken place specific plans have been suggested. The results to date are not satisfactory; they are more evident in developed countries. In our country, the maternal mortality ratio in the last fifteen years has been stable around 60 per thousand live births, which is considered high. The factors involved are many, including health and other areas such as socioeconomic, cultural and environmental. Guidelines for maternity care are presented: health promotion, health-care activities, teaching, research and administrative measures, aimed to reduce these terrible tragedies.

AB  - The 1911 summer was exceptional, because of its length and of the number of dog days, according to a Century overview (1901-2000) of meteorological statistics for Belgium. An excess of 9,000 deaths were estimated for the year 1911 and they were precisely concentrated during the August and Septembermonths. The available causes-of death figures allow to identify the infants (less than one year of age) to be highly vulnerable to the digestive diseases usually observed during the hot summers: infant mortality due to gastroenteritis accounted for around 60% of the excess general mortality registered this year. Local medical reports mentioned local shortages in drink water due to the drought, but also shortages in good quality milk provisions due to an unexpectedly virulent aphthous fever affecting the stock farmings all over the country. Although an exceptional increase in infant deaths due to hot summer related diseases was observed, the Provincial Medical Reports did not mention any specific action undertaken to prevent or to lower the incidence of those highly lethal diseases in bottle fed infants.They all call upon the development of Child health clinics and of infant health educational conferences to mothers. The First World War and the food crisis brought about by the German occupation of the country gave rise to a rapid increase in the number of Child health clinics covering a large part of the country by the end of the War. As they succeed in preventing excess infant mortality during the War period, the system was institutionalised at the national level in 1919 with the creation of the Belgian Maternal and Child Health system called Oeuvre Nationale de l'Enfance (ONE). © Belin.

AB  - Introduction: Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) and more recently developed prehospital casualty triage algorithms are widely used, in part because they are easy to teach and learn, and can be performed rapidly. Every rapid triage protocol has inherent, significant limitations: (1) no mechanism of injury (MOI) considerations; (2) limited assessment points; and (3) no refinement in truly mass-casualty situations where transport of "minor" or "moderate" patients may be delayed.Hypothesis: When rapid initial triage protocols are utilized, a significant triage deficiency ("under-triage") may occur when "minor" or "moderate" casualties actually are more severely injured than initially triaged. Some MOI produce casualties with subtle or latent (i.e., hidden or delayed) signs and symptoms not considered in the commonly used prehospital triage algorithms. This research did not focus on START or other initial triage screening methods. Instead, it focuses on developing follow-on triage guidance to more specifically prioritize "delayed transport" casualties based upon signs and symptoms related to their MOI.Methods: Using expert opinion and accepted clinical criteria, triage algorithms were developed to re-evaluate patients triaged to "minor" and "moderate" cohorts. A detailed literature search produced a draft list of relevant signs and symptoms for each selected MOI. The lists then were evaluated by a multi-disciplinary panel of experts via an anonymous, mail-based Delphi method. The input shaped triage algorithms for each selected MOI, which then were subjected to a second stage Delphi process.Results: Consensus was achieved using the Delphi method. The algorithms extend patient assessment beyond the rapid initial triage protocols and incorporate triage criteria specific to each selected injury mechanism or condition: (1) penetrating injuries; (2) unconventional MOI (burns, blast, chemical, radiation); (3) smoke and other inhalation exposure; and (4) injuries with concomitant pregnancy. The full list of triage protocols is designated by the acronym "-PLUS".Conclusions: "-PLUS" Prehospital Casualty Triage may supplement the strengths of already existing, widely accepted mass-casualty triage strategies. It does not displace START or other rapid initial triage protocols, but in mass-casualty situations with extensive delays in transport, it provides a method to identify under-triage of seriously injured casualties. "-PLUS" also presents a framework for capturing the triage considerations used by experienced medical providers, and so may provide a valuable teaching tool for training future triage professionals. Further research and field assessment is required. © 2010 World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine.

AB  - Background: Age-specific pediatric health consequences of community disruption after Hurricane Katrina have not been analyzed. Post-Katrina vital statistics are unavailable. The objectives of this study were to validate an alternative method to estimate child mortality rates in the greater New Orleans area and compare pre-Katrina and post-Katrina mortality rates. Methods: Pre-Katrina 2004 child mortality was estimated from death reports in the local daily newspaper and validated by comparison with pre-Katrina data from the Louisiana Department of Health. Post-Katrina child mortality rates were analyzed as a measure of health consequences. Results: Newspaper-derived estimates of mortality rates appear to be valid except for possible underreporting of neonatal rates. Pre-Katrina and post-Katrina mortality rates were similar for all age groups except infants. Post-Katrina, a 92% decline in mortality rate occurred for neonates (<28 days), and a 57% decline in mortality rate occurred for postneonatal infants (28 days-1 year). The post-Katrina decline in infant mortality rate exceeds the pre-Katrina discrepancy between newspaper-derived and Department of Health-reported rates. Conclusions: A declining infant mortality rate raises questions about persistent displacement of high-risk infants out of the region. Otherwise, there is no evidence of long-lasting post-Katrina excess child mortality. Further investigation of demographic changes would be of interest to local decision makers and planners for recovery after public health emergencies in other regions. © 2010 American Medical Association.

AB  - In medicine, an adverse effect (AE) is a harmful and undesired effect resulting from a medication or intervention and procedures. Some AEs only occur when starting, increasing or discontinuing a treatment; in this case they are a function of dosage or drug levels at the target organs, or they may also be caused by drug interactions. The distinction between adverse and non-adverse effects is a major undertaking when a new drug is developed and tested. Studies are used to define the dosage to be used in human testing (Phase 1) as well as to calculate the maximum admissible daily intake. Imperfections in clinical trials sometimes lead to public health disasters and the withdrawal of the drug from commerce. Surgery may have a number of undesirable or harmful after-effects. Diagnostic procedures may also have AEs, depending much on whether they are invasive, non-invasive or minimally invasive. In clinical trials, a distinction is made between AEs and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). Generally, any event which causes death, permanent damage, birth defects, or requires hospitalization is considered an SAE.

AB  - Background. In 2001, North West Province took the decision to increase bed capacity at Brits Hospital from 66 beds to 267 beds. After careful consideration of costs and an assessment of available land, it was decided to demolish the existing hospital and rebuild the new hospital on the same site. It was planned that during this time clinical services would be moved to a temporary makeshift hospital and to primary health care clinics. This case study documents the consequences of this decision to move services to the makeshift hospital and how these challenges were dealt with. Methods. A cross-sectional descriptive study was undertaken. Ten key members of staff at management and service delivery level, in the hospital and the district, were interviewed. Key documents, reports, correspondence, hospital statistics and minutes of meetings related to the move were analysed. Results. The plan had several unforeseen consequences with serious effects on patient care. Maternity services were particularly affected. Maternity beds decreased from 30 beds in the former hospital to 4 beds in the makeshift hospital. As numbers of deliveries did not greatly decrease, this resulted in severe overcrowding, making monitoring and care difficult. Perinatal mortality rates doubled after the move. An increase in maternal deaths was noted. The lack of inpatient ward space resulted in severe overcrowding in Casualty. The lack of X-ray facilities necessitated patients being referred to a facility 72 km away, which often caused a delay of 3 days before management was completed. After-hours X-rays were done in a private facility, adding to unforeseen costs. Although the initial plan was for the makeshift hospital to stabilise and refer most patients, referral routes were not agreed upon or put in writing, and no extra transportation resources were allocated. The pharmacy had insufficient space for storage of medication. In spite of all these issues, relationships and capacity at clinics were strengthened, but not sufficiently to meet the need. Discussion. Hospital revitalisation requires detailed planning so that services are not disrupted. Several case studies have highlighted the planning necessary when services are to be moved temporarily. Makeshift hospitals have been used when renovating or building hospitals. During war or disasters, plans have been made to decant patients from one facility to another. From the Brits case study, it would appear that not enough detailed planning for the move was done initially. This observation includes failure to appreciate the interrelatedness of systems and the practicality of the proposal, and to budget for the move and not just the new structure. Conclusion. The current service offered at the makeshift hospital at Brits is not adequate and has resulted in poor patient care. It is the result of a planning process that did not examine the consequences of the move, both logistic and financial, in adequate detail. Committed hospital staff have tried their best to offer good care in difficult circumstances.

AB  - Background: Although disaster causes distress, many disaster victims do not develop long-term psychopathology. Others report benefits after traumatic experiences (posttraumatic growth). The objective of this study was to examine demographic and hurricane-related predictors of resilience and posttraumatic growth. Methods: We interviewed 222 pregnant southern Louisiana women and 292 postpartum women completed interviews at delivery and 8 weeks later. Resilience was measured by scores lower than a nonaffected population, using the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist. Posttraumatic growth was measured by questions about perceived benefits of the storm. Women were asked about their experience of the hurricane, addressing danger, illness/injury, and damage. Chi-square tests and log-Poisson models were used to calculate associations and relative risks for demographics, hurricane experience, and mental health resilience and perceived benefit. Findings: Thirty-five percent of pregnant and 34% of the postpartum women were resilient from depression, whereas 56% and 49% were resilient from posttraumatic stress disorder. Resilience was most likely among White women, older women, and women who had a partner. A greater experience of the storm, particularly injury/illness or danger, was associated with lower resilience. Experiencing damage because of the storm was associated with increased report of some perceived benefits. Conclusion: Many pregnant and postpartum women are resilient from the mental health consequences of disaster, and perceive benefits after a traumatic experience. Certain aspects of experiencing disaster reduce resilience, but may increase perceived benefit. © 2010 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.

T2  - Twenty-First Century Color Lines: Multiracial Change in Contemporary America
PY  - 2009

AB  - The racial profile of the United States has changed dramatically over just three and a half decades, within the lifetime of even the youngest baby boomer. In 2005 one in three residents was a racial or ethnic minority, up from one in six in 1970. Hispanics are now the largest minority group and are projected to be a quarter of the total population by midcentury, when no single major racial or ethnic group will claim the majority. Further, the younger age structure of the minority population means that this racial transition will occur considerably sooner among the young. The old black-white paradigm-never entirely adequate-is now completely deficient, and diversity within race/ethnic groups, fueled by continued foreign immigration from a host of countries, complicates the picture even further. The once rigid color line, demarcating both the separation and inequality between races, has become blurred. Moreover, stark regional differences mean that these racial dynamics are playing out differently across the nation. Because the history of slavery, Jim Crow, and discrimination against blacks has defined America's fundamental racial struggle, the color line must first be addressed in the context of African Americans. Just as it was highlighted by the 1968 Kerner Commission report which warned of "two societies, one black, one white-separate and unequal," the ongoing inequality of blacks was once again brought to the forefront in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when the flood waters laid bare the plight of those relegated to lower ground and without the resources to flee. The nation has made much progress since the civil rights era of the 1950s and 1960s, yet stubborn problems remain, particularly for certain black subgroups. The emergence of the black middle class, higher levels of homeownership, income, and educational attainment over the long run, and less racial animosity testify to this progress. Yet even middleclass and professional blacks have been unable to use these assets to move into neighborhoods which include the same resources available to similarly situated whites. Residential segregation, while easing in some locations, is still at very high levels in those metropolitan areas where most blacks live, isolating them in communities with poorer educational and employment opportunities and greater health risks. The gap between black and white unemployment has remained essentially unchanged over four decades, while black poverty and income levels remain among the worst among major racial and ethnic groups, exacerbated by the high share of black single-parent and single-earner households. Young black men face particular difficulties, posting high dropout rates, disconnection from the workforce, and incarceration rates that often lead to disenfranchisement and inability to obtain employment. In a tragic cycle, men who leave prison often return to their previous neighborhoods with few good options and considerable temptation to return to criminal activity. Despite continued inequality across a wide range of measures, many whites believe that blacks have essentially achieved parity and that "race neutral" policies are needed to ensure a "level playing field." Or that, as a nation, we have tried to address these inequalities to the best of our ability, and those remaining are a matter of individual responsibility or neutral market forces. Indeed, court decisions which affirm this view have been responsible for rolling back much of the progress in school desegregation that was achieved in the South. Blacks and whites hold fundamentally different views regarding the availability of equal employment, educational, and housing opportunities and the importance of racial discrimination in limiting these opportunities. Given the conservative policy climate and the composition of the U.S. Supreme Court, the likelihood of major policy initiatives to address these inequalities is small, making it even more important for researchers to reveal these disparities so starkly and engagingly that people will accept a common understanding and more effectively look for solutions. Like African Americans, Native Americans have endured a long history of subjugation and oppression, so their very survival as a people is a victory. Yet, with high rates of interracial marriage and with population growth due, in part, to people's increased self-identification of Indian heritage, the very definition of the Indian "race" is somewhat murky. Further, because the Indian population is relatively small-less than the number of Chinese Americans in the United States-and is divided among five hundred tribes, many surveys do not provide separate estimates for Indians, but aggregate them with "others." We do know that they have among the lowest economic and educational status of any racial group and are disproportionately dependent on public assistance. While Indians have higher levels of homeownership than many minority groups, they are more likely to live in inadequate and crowded housing. They also suffer high levels of infant mortality, alcoholism, and diabetes. Approximately 40 percent live on reservations, and those living on or near Indian lands tend to have worse outcomes than Indians overall. Because of their relatively small numbers, complicated sovereignty issues, and a lack of data, the Native American situation is sometimes easy to overlook. But, as they progress further toward self-determination and economic advancement, we cannot forget the descendants of America's first inhabitants and the struggles that they still face. Latinos, particularly Latino immigrants, are the face of the next major civil rights struggle in the United States. In many ways, Latino socioeconomic, demographic and health outcomes are better than African Americans', and they generally face lower levels of segregation and discrimination. Yet, because their population is surging during a politically conservative era, their opportunity to take part fully in the American dream is unsure. Geographic concentration of immigrants, most of whom are Latinos, has raised concern about stresses on schools, hospitals and other social services. Major legislation which would designate illegal immigrants as felons, criminalize anyone who provides assistance to the undocumented, and attempt to deport all 11.5 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants has garnered considerable support. With a terrorist attack inside the United States or a downswing in economy, demands for such action could become even more intense. The socioeconomic status of Latinos varies considerably, in part according to their country of origin, length of time in the United States, and English ability. A number of factors work in their favor, including relatively high employment rates, multiple earner households, two-parent families, and generally positive health outcomes, despite a disproportionate lack of health insurance. And, the longer they remain in the United States, the more they progress up the economic ladder. Though they experience considerable discrimination, they are sometimes favored by employers over African Americans. Still, as the economy increasingly rewards higher education and a continued influx of low-skilled immigrants puts downward pressure on wages, Latinos will continue to fall behind unless they can upgrade their skills. Currently their lower educational attainment has led to the lowest earnings levels and occupational status of all major groups. With many Latino children attending poorly performing schools that are highly segregated by race, income, and language ability and a high share dropping out of school, much more needs to be done to assist Latinos gain a foothold above the lowest rungs of the economic ladder. Education has been instrumental in securing the success of many Asian populations in the United States. With higher levels of educational attainment, school test scores, college persistence rates, income, occupational status, two-parent families, and health status than whites overall, Asians are also the least resi-dentially segregated from whites. In fact, relative to whites with similar income profiles, Asians actually live in more affluent neighborhoods. Still, Asians are even more heterogeneous than Latinos in terms of culture, language, and country of origin, and vary considerably across the socioeconomic spectrum as well. While all groups contain examples of individuals overcoming great odds, some Asian subgroups, such as Cambodians and Hmong, are among the most impoverished in the nation. In celebrating the success of the Asian experience overall, we must not use too broad a brush and neglect the needs and stories of those who continue to struggle. And, during a period of retrenchment around immigration policy, it is also instructive to recall that the same Asian nationalities that are now sometimes termed "model minorities" were despised, excluded, and interned within just the last one hundred fifty years of our nation's history. © 2009 by Temple University Press.

AB  - In 2005, there were 536,000 maternal deaths worldwide, which equates to four Jumbo jets crashing a day or one death per minute. Developing countries accounted for 90% of these deaths. More than half of the maternal deaths occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, followed by South Asia, which together accounted for 86% of global maternal deaths. Maternal mortality rate was highest in developing countries (450 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) in contrast to developed countries (9/100,000) and countries of Commonwealth independent states (51/100,000).The highest recorded maternal mortality is in the Hindu Kush of Afghanistan where the maternal mortality per 100,000 births is 6,500. Even the basic emergency obstetric services are not available in countries with high maternal mortality rates. There is either lack of trained staff, equipment, and supplies. Because of their status in society, lack of education, and understanding of health related issues, women delay seeking existing health care. During conflict or catastrophe, there is a rise in maternal death because of damage to health facilities, difficulty in reaching the facilities. This has become evident from the war conflict in Sierra Leone, Timor, Afghanistan, and Iraq and also from natural disasters like Asian tsunami. According to UNICEF, maternal mortality rate in Iraq has gone up by 65% in last 15 years.

AB  - The interment of infants in ceramic receptacles was a fairly widespread funerary practice in southern Africa during the Iron Age. Using the rich source of ethnographic data on child-death and mortuary practices among Southeast Bantu speakers, we explore the cultural significance and symbolic meaning of an infant pot burial uncovered on Melora Saddle, an early nineteenth-century African farmer settlement on the Waterberg Plateau, Limpopo Province. The skeletal remains belong to a perinatal individual, aged between 34 weeks gestation and newborn. The short-necked jar was interred in an upright position either inside, or close to, a house. Ethnographic data show that a conceptual link was made between a woman's reproductive capacity and the land's fertility, as well as between potting and procreation. A close symbolic link existed between pots, wombs, mothers and their houses. Child-birth and child-death were fraught with ritual danger that had to be averted to ensure the well-being of the family and the community. Any deviations from the natural order of things generated pollution (heat or dirt), which threatened a woman's fertility and a lineage's continuation. Such ritual impurity not only destabilised the social order, but also disturbed the natural order, as a result of which the rains, the ultimate sign of a community's well-being, might stay away. To counter the ritual danger, and thereby to restore a woman's fertility and avoid a drought, foetuses and infants were buried in jars, either in a cool, wet place in the bank of a river, or inside a house or in the shade under its eaves. As in the case of the Melora Saddle jar, the bases of such burial vessels were often deliberately perforated, evidently a symbolic act to ensure that a woman would become pregnant again. Ash, representing an extinguished fire, served as an important cooling agent in such burials, which would account for the location of several midden burials uncovered in Iron Age sites.

AB  - The industrial area of Baia Mare is highly polluted with heavy metals causing serious effects on the health of the population. A possible effect can be the generation of congenital anomalies, as well. The present paper focuses on determining the evolution of the frequency of malformations in new-born children in the Baia Mare maternity in the period between 2001 and 2005. The study of a sample consisting of 14,857 new-born children, out of wich 14,678 were born alive, has led to the following results: I. In the period 2001-2005, the average rate of 1.20 % of the still-born children can be considered as a high value if it is compared to the rate of 1.46 %, established for the period 1981-1990, a period marked by the nuclear accident in Chernobyl, whose consequences on neonatal mortality are certain and well known. II. In the same period, the average rate of infantile perinatal mortality is of 0.70 %. This value was even more omnious as in a previous period 1981-1990, during the nuclear accident in Chernobyl, the average rate of perinatal deceases was 0.58 %. III. In the period under analysis, the average rate of 4.03 % of congenital anomalies is significantly above the world rate of 2-3 %.

AB  - Background: Earthquakes and other catastrophic events frequently occurring worldwide can be considered as outliers and cause a growing and urgent need to improve our understanding of the negative effects imposed by such disasters. Earthquakes can intensively impact the birth outcomes upon psychological and morphological development of the unborn children, albeit detailed characteristics remain obscure. Methods and Findings: We utilized the birth records at Du Jiang Yan and Peng Zhou counties to investigate the birth outcomes as a consequence of a major earthquake occurred in Wenchuan, China on May 12, 2008. Totally 13,003 of neonates were recorded, with 6638 and 6365 for pre- and post- earthquake, respectively. Significant low birthweight, high ratio of low birthweight, and low Apgar scores of post-earthquake group were observed. In contrast, the sex ratio at birth, birth length and length of gestation did not show statistical differences. The overall ratio of birth-defect in the postearthquake (1.18%) is statistically high than that of pre-earthquake (0.99%), especially for those in the first trimester on earthquake day (1.47%). The birth-defect spectrum was dramatically altered after earthquake, with the markedly increased occurrences of ear malformations. The ratio of preterm birth post-earthquake (7.41%) is significant increased than that of pre-earthquake (5.63%). For the birth outcomes of twins, significant differences of the ratio of twins, birth weight, ratio of low birthweight and birth-defect rate were observed after earthquake. Conclusion: A hospital-based study of birth outcomes impacted by the Wenchuan earthquake shows that the earthquake was associated with significant effects on birth outcomes, indicating it is a major monitor for long-term pregnant outcomes. © 2009 Tan et al.

AB  - At the turn of the century, newspapers across America carried reports of a handful of infant deaths in St. Louis linked to contaminated diphtheria vaccine. Congress responded to the resulting outcry with the Biologics Act of 1902, inaugurating a century of food and drug "crisis legislation." This article explores the history of Congressional responses to high-profile safety events in the area of food and drug law, from the Biologics Act to the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. It suggests that this pattern may be seen as an example of what Justice Stephen Breyer has labeled the "vicious circle": a pernicious feedback loop linking public misperception, legislative overreaction, and regulatory irrationality. But the article also argues that these findings may fit a more sympathetic paradigm, and that the refrain of crisis and response might be viewed as a natural, unavoidable, and even beneficial facet of legislative evolution.

AB  - We review the literature on the effects of Hurricane Katrina on perinatal health, and providing data from our own research on pregnant and postpartum women. After Katrina, obstetric, prenatal, and neonatal care was compromised in the short term, but increases in adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight, and maternal complications were mostly limited to highly exposed women. Both pregnant and postpartum women had rates of post-traumatic stress disorder similar to, or lower than, others exposed to Katrina, and rates of depression similar to other pregnant and postpartum populations. Health behaviors, such as smoking and breastfeeding, may have been somewhat negatively affected by the disaster, whereas effects on nutrition were likely associated with limited time, money, and food choices, and indicated by both weight gain and loss. We conclude that, with a few specific exceptions, postdisaster concerns and health outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women were similar to those of other people exposed to Hurricane Katrina. In such situations, disaster planners and researchers should focus on providing care and support for the normal concerns of the peripartum period, such as breastfeeding, depression, and smoking cessation. Contraception needs to be available for those who do not want to become pregnant. Although additional physical and mental health care needs to be provided for the most severely exposed women and their babies, many women are capable of surviving and thriving in postdisaster environments. © 2009, Copyright the Authors.

AB  - Objective: To study the effect of large doses of phenobarbital used for a suicide attempt during pregnancy for fetuses to estimate the teratogenic potential of phenobarbital. Design and setting: Comparative analysis of exposed children and their unexposed sibs born to pregnant patients who attempted suicide during pregnancy and admitted to the toxicological inpatient clinic, Budapest, 1960-1993. Study participants: Of 1044 self-poisoned pregnant women, 88 used phenobarbital for suicide attempt and delivered newborn babies. Main outcome measures: Structural birth detects, i.e., congenital abnormalities (CAs). Results: Doses ranged between 400 and 3000 mg of phenobarbital in 88 pregnant women who attempted suicide with this drug during pregnancy and later delivered live-born babies. Twelve (13.6%) of 88 exposed children and eight (10.3%) of 78 sibs were affected with CAs (odds ratios (OR) with 95%CI: 1.4, 0.6-3.5). Of 88 exposed children, 34 were born to mothers who attempted suicide with phenobarbital between the 3rd and 12th postconceptional weeks, the critical period of most CAs; 3 had CAs (diaphragmatic defect, multiple CA, undescended testis), but only diaphragmatic defect might be associated with phenobarbital used for suicide attempt. Conclusions: The use of phenobarbital once but extremely large doses in non-epileptic pregnant women does not seem to pose a significant risk for CAs. Our experiences show the feasibility and benefits of the disaster epidemiological self-poisoning model for estimating human teratogenic risks of drug exposure.

AB  - 1.Human sex ratio at birth at the population level has been suggested to vary according to exogenous stressors such as wars, ambient temperature, ecological disasters and economic crises, but their relative effects on birth sex ratio have not been investigated. It also remains unclear whether such associations represent environmental forcing or adaptive parental response, as parents may produce the sex that has better survival prospects and fitness in a given environmental challenge. 2.We examined the simultaneous role of wars, famine, ambient temperature, economic development and total mortality rate on the annual variation of offspring birth sex ratio and whether this variation, in turn, was related to sex-specific infant mortality rate in Finland during 1865-2003. 3.Our findings show an increased excess of male births during the World War II and during warm years. Instead, economic development, famine, short-lasting Finnish civil war and total mortality rate were not related to birth sex ratio. Moreover, we found no association between annual birth sex ratio and sex-biased infant mortality rate among the concurrent cohort. 4.Our results propose that some exogenous challenges like ambient temperature and war can skew human birth sex ratio and that these deviations likely represent environmental forcing rather than adaptive parental response to such challenges. © 2009 British Ecological Society.

AB  - Large-scale infectious epidemics present the medical community with numerous medical and ethical challenges. Recent attention has focused on the likelihood of an impending influenza pandemic caused by the H5N1 virus. Pregnant women in particular present policymakers with great challenges to planning for such a public health emergency. By recognizing the specific considerations needed for this population, we can preemptively address the issues presented by infectious disease outbreaks. We reviewed the important ethical challenges presented by pregnant women and highlighted the considerations for all vulnerable groups when planning for a pandemic at both the local and the national level.

AB  - Do aggregate income shocks, such as those caused by macroeconomic crises or droughts, reduce child human capital? The answer to this question has important implications for public policy. If shocks reduce investments in children, they may have a long-lasting impact on poverty and its intergenerational transmission. The authors develop a simple framework to analyze the effects of aggregate economic shocks on child schooling and health. They show that the expected effects are theoretically ambiguous because of a tension between income and substitution effects. They then review the recent empirical literature on the subject. In richer countries, like the United States, child health and education outcomes are counter-cyclical: they improve during recessions. In poorer countries, mostly in Africa and low-income Asia, the outcomes are procyclical: infant mortality rises and school enrollment and nutrition fall during recessions. In the middle-income countries of Latin America, the picture is more nuanced: health outcomes are generally procyclical and education outcomes counter-cyclical. Each of these findings is consistent with the simple conceptual framework. The authors discuss possible implications for expenditure allocation. © The Author 2009.

AB  - Since the rates and causes of mortality are critical indicators of the overall health of a population, it is important to evaluate mortality even where no complete vital statistics reporting exists. Such settings include humanitarian emergencies. Experience in cross-sectional survey methods to assess retrospectively crude, age-specific, and maternal mortality in stable settings has been gained over the past 40 years, and methods appropriate to humanitarian emergencies have been developed. In humanitarian emergencies, crude and age-specific mortality can be gauged using methods based on the enumeration of individuals resident in randomly selected households-frequently referred to as a household census. Under-five mortality can also be assessed through a modified prior birth history method in which a representative sample of reproductive-aged women are questioned about dates of child births and deaths. Maternal mortality can be appraised via the initial identification of maternal deaths in the study population and a subsequent investigation to determine the cause of each death. © Overseas Development Institute, 2009.

AB  - In the October 2005 Earthquake in mountainous Azad Kashmir and adjacent areas in Pakistan, a young female sustained crush injury chest and upper abdomen. She remained hospitalized with lower chest pain. All initial investigations were normal and she was discharged symptom-free on conservative management. Six months later, she developed acute left sided chest pain and dyspnoea. Provisional diagnosis of empyema was made on X-ray, and tube thoracostomy was done. Diagnostic VATS revealed gastropleural fistula secondary to necrosis of herniated stomach. Resection of necrosed stomach, repair of diaphragm and decortication and transthoracic repair with lower thoracoplasty two months later was performed but both were unsuccessful. After another 02 months, a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy at fistula site was fashioned which proved curative.

AB  - Recent human studies have shown that a wide variety of prenatal stressors, from anxiety and partner relationship problems, to natural disasters, increase the risk for a diverse range of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in the child. These include impaired cognitive development and behavioral problems, autism and schizophrenia. However, many questions remain about the underlying processes. Much of the research, based on animal studies, has focussed on the maternal HPA axis, with mixed results. Maternal stress or anxiety during pregnancy has been found to be weakly associated with raised maternal cortisol, if at all. The placenta may be a more promising programming vector, because it controls fetal exposure to the maternal environment. Animal studies indicate that prenatal stress can affect the activity of the placental barrier enzyme 11-βHSD2, which metabolises cortisol. We review the evidence for a similar mechanism in humans and how maternal stress may cause other changes in the placenta which affect fetal neurodevelopment. © 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Shallow groundwater is the main source for drinking water in Kabul, Afghanistan. It comes from a multitude of shallow hand-pumped wells spread over the whole city area. The groundwater is characterised by slightly oxic redox conditions. Interactions with aquifer carbonates lead to near-neutral pH and high degrees of hardness. The mostly negative water budget of the Kabul Basin is the result of strong evaporation which leads to an increase in salt and also of some undesirable constituents, e.g. borate. Several years of drought have aggravated this problem. The shallow groundwater in the city has received tremendous amounts of pollution due to a lack of proper waste disposal and sewage treatment. Common indicators are elevated concentrations of nutrients such as nitrate and faecal bacteria. The high infant mortality can at least partially be attributed to the insufficient water hygiene. Acid generated during the mineralisation of the wastewater is hidden due to the strong pH buffering capacity of the groundwater system. Redox and pH conditions preclude significant mobilisation of trace metals and metalloids. © Springer-Verlag 2008.

AB  - Acute hepatitis is seen sporadically round the year in Bangladesh. The incidence of acute viral hepatitis E increases after floods as this allows sewerage contamination of piped and groundwater. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the burden of hepatitis E virus (HEV infection) in Bangladesh. Patients attending the Hepatology Unit III of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, during June 2004-December 2006, were included in the study. All viral markers were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The study population was divided in four groups. Group 1 included 144 patients with acute viral hepatitis. The inclusion criteria were: nausea and/or vomiting, loss of appetite, serum bilirubin >200 μmol/L, raised serum transaminases, and prothrombin time >3 seconds prolonged beyond control value. In Group 2, there were 31 pregnant women with acute viral hepatitis. All the patients had prodrome, icterus, raised serum bilirubin and raised serum transaminase levels. Group 3 included 23 patients presenting with fulminant hepatic failure. In Group 4, 69 patients with cirrhosis of liver were included. They presented with features of decompensation for the first time. The inclusion criteria were: patients with established cirrhosis with jaundice and/or ascites and/or hepatic encephalopathy. In Group 1, 58.33% of the 144 patients had acute viral hepatitis E. In Group 2, 45.16% of the pregnant women also had acute viral hepatitis E. HEV was responsible for 56.52% cases of fulminant hepatic failure in Group 3. In 21.7% cases in Group 4, decompensation of cirrhosis was due to HEV. Acute viral hepatitis E in the third trimester of pregnancy and HEV-induced fulminant hepatic failure were associated with 80% of mortality despite the best possible care. In this clinical context, acute viral hepatitis E is the leading cause of wide spectrum of liver disease ranging from severe acute viral hepatitis, fulminant hepatic failure, to decompensation of liver in cirrhotics in Bangladesh. Sewerage contamination of piped water following floods may contribute to the higher incidence of HEV infection. © International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh.

AB  - Aims: The present study assessed the health impact of stress on women who were pregnant during, or immediately after, a major earthquake and were living in the disaster area. Inherent resistance against the stress induced by the earthquake was also assessed. Methods: The panel study consisted of 99 women who provided responses before and after delivery (response rate, 77.9%). Psychological impact was assessed on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and stress resistance was assessed on the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC). Results: In adjusted multivariate models, the significant earthquake factor that predicted postnatal depression (EPDS) was 'existing anxiety about an earthquake' (β = 0.27, P = 0.01) and 'parity' (β = -0.26, P = 0.02). The SOC during pregnancy significantly moderated between 'existing anxiety about an earthquake' and 'EPDS' (β = -0.21, P = 0.02). During pregnancy the EDPS was a significant predictor of a physical abnormality during pregnancy or childbirth (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.41). The SOC during pregnancy did not moderate between a physical abnormality and earthquake-related stress. Conclusions: Provision of an adequate support system and improvement of the SOC of young women affected by a disaster may be two ways of reducing the deleterious effects of disaster-related stress on maternal well-being. © 2009 The Authors.

AB  - We adapt the basic principles of the Keynes Plan and argue for the creation of a supranational bank money (SBM) that would coexist along side national currencies and for the establishment of a new international clearing union (NICU). These principles remain timely because the fundamental causes of the instability of the international monetary system are as valid today as they were in the early forties. The new supranational money would be created against domestic earning assets of the Fed and the ECB and its quantity would be demand-driven. Our proposal is not an agreement on exchange rates, which while possible is not essential to the functioning of the SBM. NICU would not hold open positions in assets denominated in national currency and consequently would not bear exchange rate risk. NICU would be more than an office recording credit and debit entries of the supranational bank money. The financial tsunami that hit the world economy in 2007-2008 provides a unique opportunity for a coordinated strategy. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.

AB  - Earthquakes are considered as one of the most destructive disasters. Several theories exist that attempt to explain earthquake behavior. The concept accepted by seismologists is the Tectonics Plate Theory. The persistent threat of seismic events and the difficulties involved with mitigating their effects highlight the importance of disaster preparedness. A review of pertinent literature reveals that up to 20% of the patients hospitalized after earthquakes suffer from nontrauma-related conditions. The conditions commonly seen are acute exacerbations of chronic conditions such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute coronary syndromes and myocardial infarctions, end-stage renal disease, anxiety, hypertension, and the onset of spontaneous abortions, among others. Although investigators examining the medical consequences of seismic events have made significant progress, additional work is necessary to further improve the care and outcomes of earthquake victims. These endeavors require a true transdisciplinary approach involving participation by individuals from multiple medical, health, and nonmedical specialties. © Kristi L. Koenig and Carl H.

AB  - Introduction Forensic dentistry (forensic odontology) can be regarded as a marriage between the dental and legal professions - the correct management, interpretation, evaluation and presentation of dental evidence for criminal or civil legal proceedings. Disasters, whether man-made or natural continue to claim lives, acts of terrorism are an ever-increasing threat, and human aggression and abuse persist worldwide. The last decade has seen much progress in the world of forensic dentistry. The discipline has striven to become more scientific, evidence based, standardized and accountable so that from call out to court the evidence is as reliable as possible. All those involved in the subject should be appropriately qualified, build up personal experience of the field, adhere to a professional code of conduct and be responsible for their continuing professional development. As in all the different forensic disciplines, the goal is to produce carefully considered conclusions free from personal bias - miscarriage of justice and incarceration of an innocent person (or release of the guilty) may be the result of getting it wrong. The responsibility of the forensic expert is great indeed. Major uses of forensic dentistry Most frequently the forensic dentist is involved with: Identification of the deceased, both individual and in mass disaster. Age estimation of both the living and deceased. Bite mark analysis, to include cases of homicide, sexual assault, fights and abuse issues. Fragment comparisons. Archaeological discoveries. Cold cases. The forensic dentist and forensic physician are most likely to work together when biting injuries are present or abuse is suspected, but a general understanding of the role of the forensic dentist can only assist in creating better understanding and teamwork between the forensic disciplines. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

AB  - This section describes the spectrum and the scale of the nonmalignant diseases that have been found among exposed populations. Adverse effects as a result of Chernobyl irradiation have been found in every group that has been studied. Brain damage has been found in individuals directly exposed - liquidators and those living in the contaminated territories, as well as in their offspring. Premature cataracts; tooth and mouth abnormalities; and blood, lymphatic, heart, lung, gastrointestinal, urologic, bone, and skin diseases afflict and impair people, young and old alike. Endocrine dysfunction, particularly thyroid disease, is far more common than might be expected, with some 1,000 cases of thyroid dysfunction for every case of thyroid cancer, a marked increase after the catastrophe. There are genetic damage and birth defects especially in children of liquidators and in children born in areas with high levels of radioisotope contamination. Immunological abnormalities and increases in viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases are rife among individuals in the heavily contaminated areas. For more than 20 years, overall morbidity has remained high in those exposed to the irradiation released by Chernobyl. One cannot give credence to the explanation that these numbers are due solely to socioeconomic factors. The negative health consequences of the catastrophe are amply documented in this chapter and concern millions of people. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB  - A detailed study reveals that 3.8-4.0% of all deaths in the contaminated territories of Ukraine and Russia from 1990 to 2004 were caused by the Chernobyl catastrophe. The lack of evidence of increased mortality in other affected countries is not proof of the absence of effects from the radioactive fallout. Since 1990, mortality among liquidators has exceeded the mortality rate in corresponding population groups. From 112,000 to 125,000 liquidators died before 2005 - that is, some 15% of the 830,000 members of the Chernobyl cleanup teams. The calculations suggest that the Chernobyl catastrophe has already killed several hundred thousand human beings in a population of several hundred million that was unfortunate enough to live in territories affected by the fallout. The number of Chernobyl victims will continue to grow over many future generations. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Smoke from massive wildfires blanketed Indonesia in late 1997. This paper examines the impact that this air pollution (particulate matter) had on fetal, infant, and child mortality. Exploiting the sharp timing and spatial patterns of the pollution and inferring deaths from "missing children" in the 2000 Indonesian Census, I find that the pollution led to 15,600 missing children in Indonesia (1.2 percent of the affected birth cohorts). Prenatal exposure to pollution drives the result. The effect size is much larger in poorer areas, suggesting that differential effects of pollution contribute to the socioeconomic gradient in health. © 2009 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This report presents birth data for the region affected by Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall along the Gulf Coast of the United States on August 29, 2005, comparing the 12-month periods before and after the storm according to a wide variety of characteristics. Data are presented for maternal demographic characteristics including age, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, and educational attainment; medical care utilization by pregnant women (prenatal care and method of delivery); and infant characteristics or birth outcomes (period of gestation and birthweight). METHODS: Descriptive tabulations of data reported on the birth certificates of residents of the 91 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-designated counties and parishes of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi are presented for the 12-month periods before and after Hurricane Katrina struck, from August 29, 2004, through August 28, 2006. Detailed data are shown separately for 14 selected, FEMA-designated coastal counties and parishes within a 100-mile radius of the Hurricane Katrina storm path, the area hit very hard by the storm and subsequent flooding. These 14 selected coastal counties and parishes are a subset of the 91 FEMA-designated counties and parishes. RESULTS: The total number of births in the 14 selected FEMA-designated counties and parishes decreased 19 percent in the 12 months after Hurricane Katrina compared with the 12 months before, with births declining in the selected counties and parishes of Louisiana and Mississippi and rising in the counties of Alabama. The number of births to non-Hispanic black women in the selected parishes of Louisiana fell substantially after Hurricane Katrina; births declined for non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific Islander women in these selected parishes as well. The percentage of births to women under age 20 years for the selected counties and parishes after the storm was essentially unchanged in Alabama and Mississippi, but decreased in Louisiana. The proportion of births to unmarried women decreased in the selected parishes of Louisiana, but increased in the selected counties elsewhere. Large decreases were observed in very preterm and very low birthweight rates for the selected parishes of Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina, whereas a large increase was observed in very preterm births for the selected counties of Alabama.

AB  - Background: Pronounced changes in patterns of health take place in adolescence and young adulthood, but the effects on mortality patterns worldwide have not been reported. We analysed worldwide rates and patterns of mortality between early adolescence and young adulthood. Methods: We obtained data from the 2004 Global Burden of Disease Study, and used all-cause mortality estimates developed for the 2006 World Health Report, with adjustments for revisions in death from HIV/AIDS and from war and natural disasters. Data for cause of death were derived from national vital registration when available; for other countries we used sample registration data, verbal autopsy, and disease surveillance data to model causes of death. Worldwide rates and patterns of mortality were investigated by WHO region, income status, and cause in age-groups of 10-14 years, 15-19 years, and 20-24 years. Findings: 2·6 million deaths occurred in people aged 10-24 years in 2004. 2·56 million (97%) of these deaths were in low-income and middle-income countries, and almost two thirds (1·67 million) were in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia. Pronounced rises in mortality rates were recorded from early adolescence (10-14 years) to young adulthood (20-24 years), but reasons varied by region and sex. Maternal conditions were a leading cause of female deaths at 15%. HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis contributed to 11% of deaths. Traffic accidents were the largest cause and accounted for 14% of male and 5% of female deaths. Other prominent causes included violence (12% of male deaths) and suicide (6% of all deaths). Interpretation: Present global priorities for adolescent health policy, which focus on HIV/AIDS and maternal mortality, are an important but insufficient response to prevent mortality in an age-group in which more than two in five deaths are due to intentional and unintentional injuries.

AB  - Current legal frameworks for radiation exposure limits are based on the risk models of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). In Publication 90 (2003), ICRP presents a safe (threshold) dose range of up to 100 mSv for radiogenic effects resulting from in utero exposure and bases this conclusion on the findings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, a variety of observations of congenital malformations, fetal loss, stillbirths and infant deaths, as well as of Down's syndrome and other health defects in children after the Chernobyl accident exposures suggest that the A-bomb survivor data are incomplete. The Chernobyl findings are generally marginalized or even denied because of the low values of the estimated human exposures and the inconsistency of the results with the accepted risk models. One explanation for the observations is that physical dosimetric models have underestimated the effective exposure. This possibility is supported by biological dosimetry in the contaminated regions. The assumptions about effects after in utero exposure by incorporated radionuclides need to be revised.

AB  - Wide variation between hospitals in the quality of critical care lead to many potentially avoidable deaths. Regionalization of critical care is a possible solution; regionalization has been implemented for trauma and neonatal intensive care, and it is under active discussion for medical and cardiac critical care. However, regionalization is only one possible approach to reorganizing critical care services. This commentary introduces the technique of network analysis as a framework for the following:(1) understanding how critically ill patients move between hospitals,(2) defining the roles hospitals play in regional care delivery, and(3) suggesting systematic improvements that may benefit population health. We examined transfers of critically ill Medicare patients in Connecticut in 2005 as a model system. We found that patients are systematically transferred to more capable hospitals. However, we find the standard distinction of hospitals into either "secondary hospitals" or "tertiary hospitals" poorly explains observed transfer patterns; instead, hospitals show a continuum of roles. We further examine the implications of the network pattern in a simulation of quarantine of a hospital to incoming transfers, as occurred during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. Network perspectives offer new ways to study systems to care for critically ill patients and provide additional tools for addressing pragmatic problems in triage and bed management, regionalization, quality improvement, and disaster preparedness. © 2009 American College or Chest Physicians.

AB  - The present study describes the effectiveness of removal of perchlorate ion by Octolig® a commercially available immobilized ligand, IMLIG, and by Cuprilig, the cupric ion derivative of this material. Octolig® consists of polyethylenediamine moieties covalently bound to a high-surface area silica gel (CAS Registry number = 404899-06-5). Perchlorate in drinking water is a nuisance anion that escapes from firms that produce rocket fuel, batteries, and fireworks and becomes a contaminant of groundwater. It may also be a natural component of the environment. Perchlorate ion can interfere with thyroid function and may also cause birth defects. Perchlorate contamination of water supplies is serious because of the difficulty in removing it, especially in the western United States where a combination of drought and water shortages exacerbate the problems of supplying safe drinking water to an increasing population. In this study, aqueous solutions were passed over a chromatography column containing samples of Cuprilig. Test water contained 70 μ g perchlorate/L and effluent was below detection level (< 1 μ g/L. Equally good results were obtained for Octolig® in deionized water and in well water. Analyses were performed by a commercial laboratory. Mechanisms of interaction are proposed.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify dietary predictors of plasma dioxin-like activity in women from the Danish National Birth Cohort. Associations between exposure and birth weight and infant development at 6 months were also explored. Diet was assessed in mid-pregnancy by a food-frequency questionnaire. One hundred nulliparous 25-35-year-old women of normal pre-pregnancy body-mass-index were chosen according to their intake of fatty fish, as fatty fish is a potential route of exposure. Intake of other foods of animal origin was also explored. Dioxin-like activity was measured in plasma using the Dioxin-Responsive Chemically Activated LUciferase eXpression (DR-CALUX) and quantified in toxic equivalents (CALUX-TEQs). Information on infant attainment of specific milestones was obtained by maternal report in a standardized interview. The sample mean was 46 pg CALUX-TEQ/g lipid. Plasma dioxin-like activity increased by 10.7 pg CALUX-TEQ/g lipid (95% CI: 1.8; 19.7) for the highest compared to the lowest tertile of total dietary fat intake but decreased by -9.8 pg CALUX-TEQ/g lipid (95% CI: -19.4; -0.2) for fatty fish intake. The inverse association for fatty fish was explained by lower intake of high-fat food groups such as red meat, fats and oils, which were also predictors of dioxin-like activity. Plasma dioxin-like activity was not associated with birth weight, but an inverse correlation was observed with total developmental score (Spearman r=-0.23, p=0.046). Our study indicates that dietary patterns associated with high fat intake may lead to increased plasma dioxin-like activity and in utero exposure might be related to early infant development. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Current accelerated tests of photovoltaic (PV) modules mostly prevent infant mortality but cannot duplicate changes occurring in the field nor can predict useful lifetime. Therefore, monitoring of field-deployed PV modules was undertaken at FSEC with goals to assess their performance in hot and humid climate under high voltage operation and to correlate the PV performance with the meteorological parameters. This paper presents performance analysis of U.S. Company manufactured thin film a-Si:H PV modules that are encapsulated using flexible front sheets and framed to be outdoor tested. Statistical data analysis of PV parameters along with meteorological parameters, monitored continuously, is carried out on regular basis with PVUSA type regression analysis. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of module arrays that are obtained periodically complement the continuous data monitoring. Moreover, effect of high voltage bias and ambient parameters on leakage current in PV modules on individual modules is studied. Any degradation occurring during initial 18 months could not be assessed due to data acquisition and hurricane problems. No significant degradation was observed in the performance of PV modules during the subsequent 30-months. It is planned to continue this study for a prolonged period so as to serve as basis for their long-term warranties.

AB  - We review the major linkages between the oceans and public health, focusing on exposures and potential health effects due to anthropogenic and natural factors including: harmful algal blooms, microbes, and chemical pollutants in the oceans; consumption of seafood; and flooding events. We summarize briefly the current state of knowledge about public health effects and their economic consequences; and we discuss priorities for future research. We find that:. • There are numerous connections between the oceans, human activities, and human health that result in both positive and negative exposures and health effects (risks and benefits); and the study of these connections comprises a new interdisciplinary area, "oceans and human health.". • The state of present knowledge about the linkages between oceans and public health varies. Some risks, such as the acute health effects caused by toxins associated with shellfish poisoning and red tide, are relatively well understood. Other risks, such as those posed by chronic exposure to many anthropogenic chemicals, pathogens, and naturally occurring toxins in coastal waters, are less well quantified. Even where there is a good understanding of the mechanism for health effects, good epidemiological data are often lacking. Solid data on economic and social consequences of these linkages are also lacking in most cases. • The design of management measures to address these risks must take into account the complexities of human response to warnings and other guidance, and the economic tradeoffs among different risks and benefits. Future research in oceans and human health to address public health risks associated with marine pathogens and toxins, and with marine dimensions of global change, should include epidemiological, behavioral, and economic components to ensure that resulting management measures incorporate effective economic and risk/benefit tradeoffs. © 2008 Kite-Powell et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Objective: This study was designed to determine whether prenatal mercury exposure, including potential releases from the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster, adversely affects fetal growth and child development. Methods: We determined maternal and umbilical cord blood total mercury of nonsmoking women who delivered at term in lower Manhattan after 11 September 2001, and measured birth outcomes and child development. Results: Levels of total mercury in cord and maternal blood were not significantly higher for women who resided or worked within 1 or 2 miles of the WTC in the month after 11 September, compared with women who lived and worked farther away. Average cord mercury levels were more than twice maternal levels, and both were elevated in women who reported eating fish/seafood during pregnancy. Regression analyses showed no significant association between (In) cord or maternal blood total mercury and birth outcomes. Log cord mercury was inversely associated with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development psychomotor score [Psychomotor Development Index (PDI)] at 36 months (b = -4.2, p = 0.007) and with Performance (b = -3.4, p = 0.023), Verbal (b = -2.9, p = 0.023), and Full IQ scores (b = -3.8, p = 0.002) on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Revised (WPPSI-R), at 48 months, after controlling for fish/seafood consumption and other confounders. Fish/ seafood consumption during pregnancy was significantly associated with a 5.6- to 9.9-point increase in 36-month PDI, and 48-month Verbal and Full IQ scores. Conclusions: Blood mercury was not significantly raised in women living or working close to the WTC site in the weeks after 11 September 2001. Higher cord blood mercury was associated with reductions in developmental scores at 36 and 48 months, after adjusting for the positive effects of fish/seafood consumption during pregnancy.

AB  - There is a growing international awareness of the health risks associated with water, and particularly in developing countries. For example: (i) a child dies in Africa every 30s due to malaria-a disease related to stagnant water, (ii) every year flooding causes many deaths world-wide, with infant mortality due to diarrhea from contaminated flood waters posing the biggest threat, and (iii) poor sanitation and its relation to hepatitis A continues to be a serious problem. A revealing measure of the extent of such global problems is that more than half of the hospital beds in the world today are occupied by people with water-related diseases. Addressing these issues mandates an interdisciplinary approach by the world's scientific and engineering community. In this spirit a workshop was held in Phoenix to provide a forum where epidemiologists, hydraulics researchers and other stakeholders of varied backgrounds (e.g., policy makers, environmental groups etc.) could all participate in a debate on a future agenda for hydro-epidemiology. The principal outcome of the workshop was a significant appreciation of the potential for interdisciplinary research and development in hydro-epidemiology and the major contribution that hydraulics professionals could offer, in partnership with the public health community, in addressing such water related disease control and prevention challenges. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

AB  - Objective: To provide evidence for establishing a health care system for pregnant women after disasters by evidence-based evaluation on the comparison of programs in different countries of the world. Methods: We electronically searched The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2008), EMbase (1984 to June 2008), VIP ( 1989 to June 2008), CBM ( 1978 to June 2008), Wangfang database (1997 to June 2008), CNKI (1994 to June 2008) and handsearched Journals such as Chinese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology to identify literatures and guidelines on pregnant women healthy care system after calamity. The quality of literatures and guidelines was assessed. Results: A total of 293 studies were searched, of which 25 studies were identified with the focuses on the consequence of pregnancy, development of fetus and first-aid of injuries of pregnant women. We found the studies on pregnant women's health care were limited, and most of them were retrospective and cohort studies, which was related to the paroxysmality, rarity and complexity of the disaster. Conclusions: The high proportion of pregnant women among displaced persons underscores the importance of examining how behavioral changes and difficulties in access to health care influencing the maternal and infant health, which needs comprehensive planning and arrangement. © 2008 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.

AB  - This paper provides a summary of the invited talk at the 2007 CDC & ATSDR 11th Biennial Symposium on Statistical Methods conference in which a university-non-profit collaboration targeted the elimination of racial disparities in perinatal health with the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS). This program will be described in four temporal stages; the pre-program early years (1999-2001) where the health burden is defined, leading to the Healthy Start years (2001-2005), in which spatial analyses, methods to effectively disseminate GIS results, the creation of the Baton Rouge Healthy Start database, and a move toward a conceptual goal of creating a holistic neighborhood GIS-health model are all described. The Katrina years (September 2005-early 2006) portrays the impact of the disaster and how the collaboration changed as resources from both were directed toward both response and recovery. The final section of the paper, the Post-Katrina years (early 2006 and ongoing) describes how the health landscape of Louisiana, including Baton Rouge as well as New Orleans, has worsened after the storms. An argument is made that the relationships and GIS structure developed during the collaboration's pre-Katrina years, even though stretched, provide the flexibility to analyze and cope with a Katrina-type shock to the system.

AB  - Schizophrenia has been linked with intrauterine exposure to maternal stress due to bereavement, famine and major disasters. Recent evidence suggests that human vulnerability may be greatest in the first trimester of gestation and rodent experiments suggest sex specificity. We aimed to describe the consequence of an acute maternal stress, through a follow-up of offspring whose mothers were pregnant during the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. A priori, we focused on gestational month and offspring's sex. Method: In a pilot study linking birth records to Israel's Psychiatric Registry, we analyzed data from a cohort of 88,829 born in Jerusalem in 1964-76. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of schizophrenia, according to month of birth, gender and other variables, while controlling for father's age and other potential confounders. Other causes of hospitalized psychiatric morbidity (grouped together) were analyzed for comparison. Results: There was a raised incidence of schizophrenia for those who were in the second month of fetal life in June 1967 (RR = 2.3, 1.1-4.7), seen more in females (4.3, 1.7-10.7) than in males (1.2, 0.4-3.8). Results were not explained by secular or seasonal variations, altered birth weight or gestational age. For other conditions, RRs were increased in offspring who had been in the third month of fetal life in June 1967 (2.5, 1.2-5.2), also seen more in females (3.6, 1.3-9.7) than males (1.8, 0.6-5.2). Conclusion: These findings add to a growing literature, in experimental animals and humans, attributing long term consequences for offspring of maternal gestational stress. They suggest both a sex-specificity and a relatively short gestational time-window for gestational effects on vulnerability to schizophrenia. © 2008 Malaspina et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Understanding the way prosimian primates age can be helpful in inferring what the 'basal primate mode' of senescence may have been. Even though prosimians are known to be long-lived in captivity, relatively little is known about their reproductive senescence, and even less is known about how prosimians age in their natural habitats. Twenty years of observational data in Madagascar for four Propithecus edwardsi sifaka groups were used to analyze reproductive and behavioral trends of aging in the wild. Techniques using tooth wear were developed to establish ages of wild sifakas and to estimate the onset of their 'dental senescence', a proxy for the onset of decline in the ability to obtain nutrition. Estimated maximum longevity was 32 years for female sifakas. Based on the loss of dental functional morphology, and changes in tooth wear patterns and in chewing efficiency, dental senescence was estimated to set in at approximately 18 years of age. Of the adult females in the study groups, the yearly average of the number of dentally senescent females was 24%. There was no indication of a decline in fertility in the dentally senescent females (aged >18 years) compared to younger adult females (aged 4-18 years). The field data showed, however, that in years when rain was decreased during months of prime lactation, infants of dentally senescent mothers died before weaning. This may be because the nursing mother's worn teeth could not shear leaves and extract moisture, nor nutrition, both essential for successful lactation. Old females showed no clear signs of social disengagement, further suggesting that drought-induced stress plays a direct role in increased infant mortality. These data support earlier findings that prosimian females continue to cycle and give birth until death. The effect of environmental variation on infant survival, however, indicates an incipient age-linked decline in reproductive fitness. Therefore, whereas lemurs represent the condition of no menopause, changes in infant survival may uncover selective factors that have in part led to the evolution of menopause in other primates.

AB  - Aim: The aim was to evaluate the trends in childhood mortality in Finland from 1969 to 2004. We especially wanted to find out whether the decline in mortality is continuous and whether there are still deaths that could be prevented. Methods: We analyzed mortality data obtained from the official cause of death statistics in Finland from 1969 to 2004. Annual mortality rates were calculated in proportion to those at risk of dying. Comparison of cause specific mortality rates was conducted for neonatal group and children aged 1 month to 15 years. Results: Annual neonatal mortality declined from 11.130/00 in 1969 to 2.460/00 in 2004. The leading causes of death were perinatal disorders and congenital malformations. Mortality among children aged 1 month to 15 years declined from 0.67/ in 1969 to 0.23/ in 2004, with accidents the leading cause of death, although congenital malformations, tumours and haematological diseases, and infectious diseases were significant causes as well. There was a notable peak in total mortality in 2004, as 44 Finnish children died in the Asian tsunami in December of that year. © 2008 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica.

AB  - On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall and inflicted devastation across the Gulf Coast. The catastrophic hurricane and flooding from failed levees in New Orleans made this event the most destructive natural and man-made disaster to occur in the United States' history (). Such a massive disaster challenged survival for everyone in its path, including patients and healthcare professionals. This hurricane challenged the usual standards of care and disaster management strategies well beyond what we had ever prepared for or experienced. The city of New Orleans was under 8 to 12 feet of water. Memorial Medical Center, located in one of the lowest sections of the city, quickly became isolated from everyone and everything. The challenges that nurses faced during the 6 days after the disaster were arduous and multifaceted. Nurses had no choice but to be creative and flexible and improvise by using what limited resources were available. Nurses were not able to provide care in the typical patient care environment because patients were relocated to multiple areas of the hospital, the ER ramp, and the parking garage to await evacuation. The temperature soared to 110°F, and evacuation efforts were chaotic and disorganized. This article describes the heroic efforts of a strong and cohesive nursing team in caring for our patients and providing for the evacuation of 16 critically ill newborns from the Level 3 regional neonatal intensive care unit and 5 well newborns and their mothers.

AB  - Natural disasters are devastating for anyone affected, but pregnant and breastfeeding women often have specific concerns about the effects of certain exposures (such as infections, chemicals, medications, and stress) on their fetus or breastfed child. For this reason, the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS) and the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention partnered to provide information for women and healthcare professionals about the effects of exposures on pregnancy and breastfeeding after the hurricanes of 2005. This service expanded on OTIS's existing telephone counseling and fact sheets. Through this project, fact sheets were created to address specific potential concerns regarding exposures after the hurricanes. The OTIS national toll-free telephone number also was modified to accommodate questions regarding hurricane-related exposures, and several strategies were used to publicize this number as a resource for obtaining hurricane-related exposure information related to pregnancy and breastfeeding. This article describes OTIS's response after the 2005 hurricanes, the challenges encountered in implementing the response, and lessons learned that might be useful to improve the response to the unique needs of this special population after any disaster or public health emergency.

AB  - This article outlines outside principles of emergency and disaster planning for neonatal intensive care units and includes resources available to organizations to support planning and education, and considerations for nurses developing hospital-specific neonatal intensive care unit disaster plans. Hospital disaster preparedness programs and unit-specific policies and procedures are essential in facilitating an effective response to major incidents or disasters, whether they are man-made or natural. All disasters place extraordinary stress on existing resources, systems, and personnel. If nurses in neonatal intensive care units work collaboratively to identify essential services in disasters, the result could be safer care for vulnerable patients.

AB  - Influenza is a highly contagious, acute febrile respiratory illness that results in global morbidity and mortality annually. Avian influenza (H5N1) has the potential to cause a pandemic. Avian influenza's epidemiology and clinical description, including common signs/symptoms, transmission, vaccination, and treatment, are presented. Recommended isolation practices for labor and delivery, and proper procedures for identifying and managing infected patients are provided. Potential maternal and newborn outcomes related to influenza and avian influenza are discussed. Pandemic planning issues are outlined, including hospital surge capacity, medical equipment and staffing availability, and the need for altered standards of care. Communities need to designate sites (whether in hospital or in alternative care centers) for labor and delivery services as part of their disaster plan. Pregnant women and newborns are vulnerable groups during routine times and are expected to be disproportionately affected during a pandemic in terms of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is essential that hospitals and communities take steps to protect these vulnerable groups as part of the disaster planning process. It is not known whether or when a pandemic will occur, but perinatal and neonatal nurses should become familiar with avian influenza's clinical description and proper infection control procedures to halt potential disease spread. © 2008 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - The discovery of an aircraft bomb from World War II made the complete evacuation of a tertiary care hospital with 629 beds and 17 specialist departments including a neonatal intensive care unit necessary. Some months before an alarm plan had been issued and a fire practice had been carried out which made it obvious to all concerned how important such measures are. Nevertheless, more room for improvement could be learned from the evacuation, in particular the rapid classification of the patients into categories and the fact that 20-30% of the patients needed stretcher-based transport for evacuation. © 2008 Springer Medizin Verlag.

AB  - Asia, the largest continent in the world, is heterogeneous in the ethnic, socioeconomic, and developmental status of its populations. A vast majority of it is poor with no adequate access to modern health care, making an accurate estimation of the nature and extent of acute kidney injury (AKI) difficult. Community-acquired AKI in otherwise healthy individuals is common, and the population developing AKI is younger compared with its counterparts in Europe or North America. The etiologic spectrum varies in different geographic regions of Asia depending on environmental, cultural, and socioeconomic factors. Some of the etiologic factors include AKI in relation to infectious diseases, intravascular hemolysis caused by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, poisonings caused by industrial chemicals or copper sulphate, animal venoms, natural medicines, heat stroke, and after complications of pregnancy. Preventive opportunities are missed because of failure to recognize the risk factors and early signs of AKI. Patients often present late for treatment, leading to multi-organ involvement and increased mortality. The exact etiologic diagnosis cannot be established in many instances because of a lack of appropriate laboratory support. Modern methods of renal replacement therapy are not universally available; and intermittent peritoneal dialysis is still widely practiced in many areas. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Health care services in developing countries are being challenged by high childhood mortality rates. Although there have been tremendous strides made in reducing infant mortality rates largely due to vaccinations and improved standards of living, a lot remains to be done to reduce neonatal mortality. Achievement of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) number 4 on childhood mortality will remain unattainable in most developing countries unless purpose based interventions targeted at reducing neonatal mortality are instituted. This viewpoint is based on the experiences gained in Eritrea, a country that gained independence less than twenty years ago following a protracted war that left a trail of destruction of infrastructure in general and health facilities in particular. War that broke out with Ethiopia less than 10 years into its independence and border conflicts followed by a no peace no war stalemate situation aggravated by frequent droughts have continued to throttle economic recovery, reconstruction and rehabilitative efforts. The population is estimated at 3.5 million comprising of nine ethnic groups who speak different languages. The country has a surface area of 124 000 km2 which shares borders with Sudan, Ethiopia, Djibouti and the Red Sea. Conclusion: Attainment of the MDG number 4 on reduction of childhood mortality can be achieved by addressing morbidities of the neonate where the bottle neck currently appears to be sited. © 2008 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To assess whether the incidence of adverse birth outcomes among Arab Americans in Michigan changed after September 11, 2001. Design: Birth data were collected on all births in Michigan from September 11, 2000, to March 11, 2001, and from September 11, 2001, to March 11, 2002. Self-reported ancestry and a name algorithm were used to determine Arab American ethnicity. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between birth before/after September 11 and birth outcomes. Main outcome measures were low birth weight (LBW), very low birth weight (VLBW), and preterm birth (PTB). Results: We observed no association between birth before/after September 11 and risk of adverse birth outcomes among Arab Americans in Michigan by using either the name algorithm or self-reported ancestry to determine Arab American ethnicity. Arab name was significantly associated with lower risk of VLBW and PTB in adjusted and unadjusted models. Arab ancestry was significantly associated with lower risk of VLBW and PTB in adjusted and unadjusted models and significantly associated with lower risk of LBW in an unadjusted model. Conclusions: In contrast to previous findings in California, we observed no difference in adverse birth outcomes before and after the events of September 11, 2001, among Arab Americans in Michigan. Arab American ethnicity is associated with lower risk of adverse birth outcomes compared to other racial/ethnic groups.

AB  - Aim: Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) causes some of the most adverse outcomes in infants with birthweight <1000 g. Incomplete antenatal steroids, acidosis, inflammation, postnatal transfer, delayed surfactant administration, hypothermia, hypotension, hypocapnia, persistent ductus arteriosus and pneumothorax are all associated with IVH. We hypothesized that prospective surveillance of these IVH-associated conditions decreases their frequency and thus the frequency of IVH. Methods: Cranial ultrasound was performed on days 1, 3, 7, 30 after birth and at discharge, and was assessed according to Papile. The incidence of IVH and IVH-associated conditions was monitored prospectively in all infants <1000 g born in our perinatal centre in 2005/2006, and obstetricians and neonatologists held monthly interdisciplinary review conferences to discuss the preventability of IVH-associated conditions (IVH surveillance). These data were compared to existing prospective data gathered during routine monitoring in 2004. Results: IVH (all grades) occurred in 29/86 extremely low birthweight (ELBW) infants during routine monitoring and in 12/89 ELBW infants during IVH surveillance (p = 0.007). IVH grades 3-4 dropped from 20% to 3.4% (p = 0.0006). There were significant differences in completeness of antenatal steroids (54% vs. 67%, p = 0.04) and timeliness in initial surfactant substitution (45% vs. 71%, p = 0.01). Most other IVH-associated conditions were reduced during IVH surveillance without reaching significance. Conclusions: IVH is not always an inevitable disaster. Obstetricians and neonatologists can reduce its incidence by joint prospective surveillance of IVH-associated conditions. © 2008 The Author(s).

AB  - Disregarding reproductive health in situations of conflict or natural disaster has serious consequences, particularly for women and girls affected by the emergency. In an effort to protect the health and save the lives of women and girls in crises, international standards for five priority reproductive health activities that must be implemented at the onset of an emergency have been established for humanitarian actors: humanitarian coordination, prevention of and response to sexual violence, minimisation of HIV transmission, reduction of maternal and neonatal death and disability, and planning for comprehensive reproductive health services. The extent of implementation of these essential activities is explored in this paper in the context of refugees in Jordan fleeing the war in Iraq. Significant gaps in each area exist, particularly coordination and prevention of sexual violence and care for survivors. Recommendations for those responding to this crisis include designating a focal point to coordinate implementation of priority reproductive health services, preventing sexual exploitation and providing clinical care for survivors of sexual violence, providing emergency obstetric care for all refugees, including a 24-hour referral system, ensuring adherence to standards to prevent HIV transmission, making condoms free and available, and planning for comprehensive reproductive health services. © 2008 Reproductive Health Matters.

AB  - The massive evacuation of sick and at-risk infants from a large metropolitan area following a natural disaster provides many lessons for neonatal nurses. Planning and education are of utmost importance, and disaster education and training are essential for all nurses. Unit-specific disaster plans can serve as a guide for nurses but the real test occurs during and after the event. Nurses must learn to adapt neonatal care to the rapidly changing environment during a disaster. Supporting high-risk infants without the aid of technology requires a back-to-the-basics approach. The ability to maintain communication and facilitate transportation of neonates out of a disaster area is essential. Nurses must also consider their own well-being in the aftermath of a disaster. Planning for future disasters should include lessons learned from the past events. This article addresses nursing care issues and lessons learned from the events that unfolded in the New Orleans area neonatal units during and after Hurricane Katrina, and guidance in support of disaster education for neonatal nurses. © 2008 Wolters Kluwer Health.

AB  - The Millenium Development Goal(MDG) number 5 sets 2015 as the target date for achieving a 75% reduction in maternal mortality rates (MMR) from the 1990 levels. We have now reached the midway point of this 15 year period Pakistan has one of the highest MMR rates in Asia. Despite the challenges that Pakistan faces in meeting the MDG target, especially in light of the recent devastating earthquake, rapid and large scale progress is feasible. In this paper, we discuss the interventions that could lead to this goal being achieved.

AB  - We examined the utility of a newly developed perceived air pollution (PAP) scale and of a modeled air pollution (MAP) scale derived from it for predicting previously observed birth outcomes of pregnant women enrolled following September 11, 2001. Women reported their home and work locations in the four weeks after September 11, 2001 and the PAP at each site on a four-point scale designed for this purpose. Locations were geocoded and their distance from the World Trade Center (WTC) site determined. PAP values were used to develop a model of air pollution for a 20-mile radius from the WTC site. MAP values were assigned to each geocoded location. We examined the relationship of PAP and MAP values to maternal characteristics and to distance of home and work sites from the WTC site. Both PAP and MAP values were highly correlated with distance from the WTC. Maternal characteristics that were associated with PAP values reported for home or work sites (race, demoralization, material hardship, first trimester on September 11) were not associated with modeled MAP values. Relationships of several birth outcomes to proximity to the WTC, which we previously reported using this data set, were also seen when MAP values were used as the measure of exposure, instead of proximity. MAP developed from reports of PAP may be useful to identify high-risk areas and predict health outcomes when there are multiple sources of pollution and a "distance from source" analysis is impossible. © 2008 Society for Risk Analysis.

AB  - Background: Children are uniquely sensitive to toxic exposures in the environment. This sensitivity reflects children's disproportionately heavy exposures coupled with the biologic vulnerability that is a consequence of their passage through the complex transitions of early development. Methods and Results: To assess effects on children's health associated with the attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) of September 11, 2001, research teams at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and other academic health centers in New York City launched a series of clinical and epidemiologic studies. Mount Sinai investigators undertook a prospective analysis of pregnancy outcomes in 182 women who were pregnant on September 11, 2001, and who had been either inside or within 0.5 miles of the WTC at the time of the attacks; they found a doubling in incidence of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) among infants born to exposed mothers as compared to infants born to unexposed women in northern Manhattan. A Columbia research team examined pregnancy outcomes in 329 women who lived, worked or gave birth in lower Manhattan in the 9 months after September 11; they found that these women gave birth to infants with significantly lower birth weight and shorter length than women living at greater distances from Ground Zero. NYU investigators documented increased numbers of new asthma cases and aggravations of preexisting asthma in children living in lower Manhattan. Mount Sinai mental health researchers documented a significant increase in mental health problems in children who directly witnessed the attacks and subsequent traumatic events; these problems were most severe in children with a past history of psychological trauma. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene established a WTC Registry that has enrolled over 70,000 persons of all ages in lower Manhattan and will follow the health of these populations to document on a continuing basis the health consequences of September 11. © 2008 Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

AB  - The objectives of the present study are (i) To examine the association between fetal nutritional status and overweight and obesity in adulthood and (ii) to provide the evidence for formulating a strategy to prevent low birth weight. With data from the 2002 Nationwide Nutrition and Health Survey, the body mass indexes (BMIs) of rural residents born during the famine years of 1959, 1960, 1961 were compared with those born in 1964. The health consequence of famine on the adulthood BMI was evident in women; the mean BMIs of the women were significantly higher in the three famine groups than that in the control group born in 1964 (P < 0.01). After adjustment for regional differences within China, the prevalences of overweight in women were significantly higher in the three famine groups (P < 0.01) and of obesity in the 1959 and 1960 groups. (P < 0.01). Such differences were not found in men. The higher risks of overweight and obesity in women were caused by malnutrition in fetal life. A strategy for preventing low birth weight should be formulated by the government to prevent chronic disease in adulthood. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: To explore the effect of health service and its influential factors in flood disaster areas. Methods: Fifty-five towns were sampled randomly from Dongting Lake area suffering from flood in 1998. The health service level, effect, and its influence factors were investigated retrospectively. Results: The incidence rate of notifiable infectious diseases was 11.7‰, prevalence rate of chronic disease was 51.2 ‰, infant mortality rate was 43.1‰, neonatal mortality rate was 10.2‰, and the total mortality rate was 554.3/100 000 in Dongting Lake area. The health investment level was significantly associated with the incidence rate of notifiable infectious diseases, the infant mortality rate, and total mortality rate. Duration of flood and income per capita were important factors for the effect of health investment. Conclusion: Increasing health investment and residents' income in the flood disaster area, shortening the duration of flood would play positive role in residents' health in the flood disaster area.

AB  - Prescription and over-the-counter drug use during pregnancy is necessary for many women today. A study of US and Canadian women found that, on average, 2.3 drugs were used during pregnancy; however, 28% reported using more than 4. For some women, this is because they become pregnant with preexisting conditions that require ongoing or intermittent pharmacotherapy. For others, this is because pregnancy itself can give rise to new medical conditions such as gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. The principal concern of prescribing physicians is whether or not agents will harm the fetus (i.e., have teratogenic effects). This concern rose to prominence primarily as a result of the thalidomide disaster. Marketed for use in morning sickness, thalidomide was found to be a potent teratogen capable of producing a variety of birth defects relating to development. Consequently, determining the teratogenicity of new drugs currently dominates the objectives of pregnancy-relevant experiments conducted throughout drug development. This often comes at the expense of valuable pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, which are seldom performed pre-market. Sex differences in PK parameters have been demonstrated in animals and humans since the 1930s. It is, therefore, not surprising that differences also arise in pregnancy. A wide array of physiological and hormonal changes occur during pregnancy; most begin early in the first trimester and increase linearly until parturition. Physicians lacking adequate PK information typically prescribe the standard adult dose in pregnancy, and this can be either inadequate or excessive depending on a variety of factors. The purpose of this report is to highlight this issue and illustrate how current methods used to obtain PK data in pregnancy are insufficient. The steps that are being taken to address this issue will also be discussed. © 2008 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB  - A recent editorial is discussed, which implied that animal-based developmental and reproductive toxicology tests will continue to be crucial, that the thalidomide disaster could have been prevented by more animal testing, and that tests on juvenile animals would help to protect children (as developing adults) from the adverse effects of pharmaceuticals. It is argued that animal tests in these scientific areas do not provide reliable data that are predictive for human responses and, even if they did, the tests are too expensive and time-consuming for application to the very large number of substances that need to be tested. It is estimated there are already more than 100,000 man-made chemicals to which humans may be exposed on a regular basis, and it is therefore widely accepted that in vivo developmental toxicology could not possibly be used to assess all new and existing chemical substances, due to the scale of its demand upon time and resources. It is therefore imperative that alternatives such as those outlined above are embraced, further developed, accepted and used - as a matter of urgency.

This unique database contains information on all patients who attempted suicide by “self-poisoning” and were cared for at central toxicological inpatient clinic in Budapest, between 1960 and 1993. A total of 1044 patients were pregnant women, of which 19 died and 411 delivered live-born babies. Of these 411 live-born children, 367 exposed children were examined and/or evaluated. This is the first report of data on the human teratogenic potential of 93 medicinal products separately used for a suicide attempt during pregnancy. Each manuscript presents results for drugs used by at least 10 pregnant women for a suicide attempt, whereas the final paper summarizes the data of drugs used rarely for suicide attempt by pregnant women. Each patient consented to participate in the study. Critical information collected under medical supervision included examination of the patients upon admittance, stage of pregnancy at suicide attempt, blood levels of the drug(s) taken for the suicide attempt (at admittance), evaluation of the infant at birth for gestational age, weight and congenital abnormalities, and follow-up studies for 2 years after a child's birth. These studies provide insight into the potential effects of a high dose of a drug or drugs taken during pregnancy because it is well accepted that “pulse high doses” of a drug during the initial susceptible period of pregnancy are those most likely to result in congenital abnormality. Although it is obvious that these data are not sufficient to ensure safety, and that it is necessary to have a larger population of exposed children, to achieve better statistical power, as well as to include data on other populations, this collection of papers provides an important introduction of the so-called disaster epidemiological approach in human teratology. It shows the feasibility of such studies and suggests that an international surveillance system of self-poisoned pregnant women would be useful to better estimate risk and benefit of drug use during pregnancy. It is envisioned that the information provided will assist physicians and mothers in making better decisions regarding drug exposure during pregnancy. © 2008, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the effects of natural disasters on pregnancy outcomes. We studied mental health and birth outcomes among women exposed to Hurricane Katrina. Methods: We collected data prospectively from a cohort of 301 women from New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Pregnant women were interviewed during pregnancy about their experiences during the hurricane, and whether they had experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or depression. High hurricane exposure was defined as having 3 or more of the 8 severe hurricane experiences, such as feeling that ones life was in danger, walking through floodwaters, or having a loved one die. Results: The frequency of low birth weight was higher in women with high hurricane exposure (14.0%) than women without high hurricane exposure (4.7%), with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-9.89; P < 0.01. The frequency of preterm birth was higher in women with high hurricane exposure (14.0%) than women without high hurricane exposure (6.3%), with aOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 0.82-6.38; P > 0.05. There were no significant differences in the frequency of low birth weight or preterm birth between women with PTSD or depression and women without PTSD or depression (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Women who had high hurricane exposure were at an increased risk of having low birth weight infants. Rather than a general exposure to disaster, exposure to specific severe disaster events and the intensity of the disaster experience may be better predictors of poor pregnancy outcomes. To prevent poor pregnancy outcomes during and after disasters, future disaster preparedness may need to include the planning of earlier evacuation of pregnant women to minimize their exposure to severe disaster events.

AB  - Background: After Hurricane Katrina, the 2 primary teaching sites for Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans were destroyed. In this study, we examine the measures the Louisiana State University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology took to provide uninterrupted education for Obstetrics and Gynecology residents and the outcome of those measures. Methods: Information was gathered from the program director's office and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education website. Resident turnover during the disaster and where residents trained before and after Katrina were tabulated. Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology scores, obstetric statistics, and American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology pass rates before and after Katrina were analyzed for significant differences from year to year. Results: After Katrina, all residents were shifted to other teaching sites in the state, and the program gained 2 additional private teaching sites. The department lost 10 residents in the year following Katrina and replaced them with 5 new residents for the next academic year. There was no significant difference in Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology scores for individual residents from 2004 to 2006, and the median score for the program has not changed significantly for the past 4 years. The only number that has changed is the number of cesarean sections performed by second-year residents, which decreased significantly from 2005-2006 to 2006-2007 but has stabilized over the last year. The classes of 2004-2006 had 100% pass rates on the written American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology examination, with 1 failure in 2007. Conclusions: The Obstetrics and Gynecology program at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center provided uninterrupted training for residents through cooperation with other Louisiana State University facilities and private institutions in the state. We saw a small decrease in the number of cesarean sections performed by our second-year residents 1 year after Katrina; however, the rest of the resident experience has remained stable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal research suggests a programming effect of prenatal stress in the fetal period, resulting in disruptions in behavioural and neuromotor development. Physiological changes that mediate these effects include alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and in testosterone levels. This human study focuses on changes related to these physiological systems after prenatal stress exposure. METHODS: We examined the potential effect of prenatal stress associated with the Chernobyl disaster in an ongoing genetic epidemiological study in Finland. One birth cohort of twins (n = 121 twin pairs) was exposed in utero to maternal stress, and their saliva cortisol and testosterone levels at age 14 were compared with twins (n = 157 twin pairs) born one year later. RESULTS: Cortisol levels in both sexes and testosterone levels among females were significantly elevated after prenatal exposure to maternal stress from the second trimester onwards, compared to reference groups of non-exposed adolescents. Exposure explains 3% of variance (p<0.05) in cortisol levels and 18% of variance in testosterone levels (p<0.001). No significant differences were found for exposure from either first or third trimester onwards. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that prenatal exposure to maternal stress in the second trimester of pregnancy may have resulted in prenatal programming of physiological systems relating to cortisol and testosterone levels.

AB  - Poverty is one of the most influential factors for ill health, and ill health - in a vicious cycle - can lead to poverty. Education has proven to be a critical strategy to break this cycle. There is a two-way link between poverty and health. Illness impairs learning ability and quality of life, has a negative impact on productivity, and drains family savings. Poor people are more exposed to environmental risks (poor sanitation, unhealthy food, violence, and natural disasters) and less prepared to cope with them. Because they are also less informed about the benefits of healthy lifestyles, and have less access to them as well as to quality health care, they are at greater risk of illness and disability. Maternal, infant and child mortality illustrate the largest gaps between the rich and the poor in today's world. There are between 7 and 8 million perinatal deaths, but we do not know exactly how many are stillbirths and how many are early neonatal deaths. In many cases, births of infants who die soon after birth are neither recorded nor counted. Although exact medical causes in countries may differ, the problem is simple: the common denominator for those deaths is the lack of appropriate and quality services, confounded by poverty.

AB  - This paper reviews the challenges relating to chronic contamination of small grains and maize with deoxynivalenol and related compounds, fumonisin and the use of ensiled cereals in cool dairy areas. Uncertainties in the tolerable daily intakes for deoxynivalenol and fumonisin are discussed as they have the potential to affect current regulatory limits. In addition, climate change is resulting in more extreme rainfall and drought events which favour formation of deoxynivalenol and fumonisin, respectively. The development and refinement of models for predicting mycotoxin accumulation from weather data will become an essential tool for managing these events. Such models are also important for providing timely food aid to developing countries, which experience increased occurrence of acute toxicities, especially in children. Chronic contamination of silage in some areas with some Penicillium toxins deserves more attention in terms of their economic effects and possible implications for the purity of milk. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - During the last decade, our knowledge of the mechanisms by which children respond to exposures to physical and chemical agents present in the environment, has significantly increased. Results of recent projects and programmes focused on children's health underline a specific vulnerability of children to environmental genotoxicants. Environmental research on children predominantly investigates the health effects of air pollution while effects from radiation exposure deserve more attention. The main sources of knowledge on genome damage of children exposed to radiation are studies performed after the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident in 1986. The present review presents and discusses data collected from papers analyzing genome damage in children environmentally exposed to ionizing radiation. Overall, the evidence from the studies conducted following the Chernobyl accident, nuclear tests, environmental radiation pollution and indoor accidental contamination reveals consistently increased chromosome aberration and micronuclei frequency in exposed than in referent children. Future research in this area should be focused on studies providing information on: (a) effects on children caused by low doses of radiation; (b) effects on children from combined exposure to low doses of radiation and chemical agents from food, water and air; and (c) specific effects from exposure during early childhood (radioisotopes from water, radon in homes). Special consideration should also be given to a possible impact of a radiochemical environment to the development of an adaptive response for genomic damage. Interactive databases should be developed to provide integration of cytogenetic data, childhood cancer registry data and information on environmental contamination. The overall aim is to introduce timely and efficient preventive measures, by means of a better knowledge of the early and delayed health effects in children resulting from radiation exposure. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The number of newborn boys was higher than that of girls in the Czech Republic each month from 1950 to 2005. The only exception was November 1986, when the number of newborn boys was significantly reduced. This has been explained by a selective negative impact of the Chernobyl accident in April 1986 on male fetuses during the third month of their prenatal development. Objectives: The first and most radioactive cloud passed over the Czech Republic during 30 April-1 May 1986. Concurrent rainfall multiplied the radioactivity by up to > 10,000-fold in specific regions. We verified a hypothesis that the decrease in the male birth fraction in November 1986 correlated with the level of radiation in eight Czech regions after the Chernobyl disaster. Results: We found a relationship between the level of radiation and the decrease in the number of newborn boys. The number of newborn boys was decreased in the six eastern regions where the radiation was strongly increased due to rain that accompanied the radioactive cloud. In contrast, the number of newborn boys was not reduced in the two western regions where the radioactivity was markedly lower. Conclusions: A negative impact of radiation on the prenatal population was manifested as a selective loss of newborn boys in November 1986. This loss correlated with level of radioactivity. The 131I probably played the most important role because of its up-take during primary saturation of fetal thyroid by iodine, which accompanies the onset of the gland function in 3-month-old fetuses.

AB  - Disasters occur not only in war and conflict or after natural events, such as earthquakes or floods. In fact, the death of hundreds of thousands of children in Niger every year, often for treatable conditions, could just as well qualify as a disaster situation. A lack of funding for health care and health-care staff and user fee policies for health care in very poor or unstable settings challenge international agreements that make statements about the right to health and access to health care for all people. This paper argues that although sustainable development is important, today many are without essential health care and die in the silent disasters of hunger and poverty. In other words, the development of health care appears to be stalled for the sake of sustainability. © 2007 The Author; Journal Compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - The Chernobyl accident (April 26, 1986) exposed a large part of the Belarus population to ionizing radiation. We analyzed the time trends of Down syndrome (DS) in Belarus to evaluate whether either brief exposure at high dose rates during the plume passage or continuous exposure at low doses and dose rates of the residents of contaminated areas had any detectable impact on DS prevalence at birth. DS data came from the Belarus National Registry of Congenital Malformations (1981-2001). We observed a significant peak of DS in January 1987 (26 cases observed and 9.84 expected; observed/expected ratio = 2.64; 95% CI = 1.72-3.76), but found no positive long-term time trends in contaminated or control areas. The time occurrence of the January peak, high dose rates during the plume passage and experimental data showing a radiosensitive phase of oogenesis around conception time in mammals suggest that the January peak may be linked to the Chernobyl plume. © 2007.

AB  - Worster-Drought syndrome (WDS) is a developmental disorder presenting as mild tetraplegic cerebral palsy (CP) with severe pseudobulbar palsy, manifested as articulation problems or anarthria, chewing, and swallowing difficulties and severe drooling. Epilepsy, learning disabilities, behavioral disturbances, and other congenital anomalies are common. WDS accounts for about 1% of CP cases. On brain imaging, migrational abnormalities are frequently found, mainly in the opercular area, however normal brain imaging does not exclude the diagnosis. Although children with WDS have serious, early-onset developmental disabilities, the specific diagnosis is frequently delayed or overlooked. There is a lack of awareness of the syndrome and an overlap with similar congenital syndromes, such as the Opercular Syndrome and Congenital Bilateral Perisylvian Syndrome. Two children with WDS are presented, emphasizing the clinical symptoms, natural history of the disorder, etiology and imaging. The similarity between WDS and other specific congenital syndromes will be discussed with the suggestion to unite them all under the name WDS.

AB  - At this early point in the 21st century a major concern that we face is the future possible effects of people-induced global warming. The predicted effects are severe, but argued by some to be avoidable if we act now. Here we consider the dimensions of another disaster: one for which not only the causes, but also their horrific consequences, are current worldwide. The implicit question is 'why are we more worried about future disasters than those already occurring?' The worldmapper collection of cartograms (where a map is used like a pie-chart to present data) is used here to illustrate the extent of international inequalities in health and living conditions, discussed in relation to other aspects of human lives. Though the shape that we can see the world is in is shocking, we can also envisage a positive future. We compare these current global times to more local past times experienced during the ravaging inequalities of Victorian Britain. We use Britain simply as an example. We end by suggesting a further step the current British Prime Minister could make in his thinking. Doing this we can see the potential for environmental reconstruction, which would result (as it did before) in considerable reductions in infant mortality. Our common future is not already mapped out; it is still to be won. © IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the APA-ANTI-DDoS (aggregate-based protocol analysis anti-DDoS) model to detect and defend the DDoS attack. APA-ANTI-DDoS model contains the abnormal traffic aggregate module, the protocol analysis module and the traffic processing module. The abnormal traffic aggregate module classifies the network traffic into normal traffic and the abnormal traffic; the protocol analysis module analyzes the potential features of DDoS attack traffic in the abnormal traffic; the traffic processing module filters the abnormal traffic according to the current features of DDoS attack, and resumes the non-attack traffic with the help of testing the congestion control feature of the traffic. The paper then implements the APA-ANTI-DDoS system. The experimental results show that APA-ANTI-DDoS model can primely detect and defend DDoS attack and resume the non-attack traffic at the time of miscarriage of justice to guarantee the legal communication traffic.

AB  - It is widely recognized that better health is a prerequisite for the overall economic and social development of a nation. Sri Lanka, like many other countries experiencing the epidemiological transition, will have to make effective decisions on health-care service management and the development of education and training programs for health-care professionals. This paper provides a comprehensive review of current health service administration, health status, trends and issues, and health financing and resource allocation in Sri Lanka. The review revealed that Sri Lanka has achieved a relatively high health status given a low level of spending on its health-care services; however, Sri Lanka still experiences vital health problems in all stages of the life cycle, mainly related to lifestyle and the epidemiological transition associated with widespread societal and economic crises. © 2007 The Authors; Journal Compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - Ever since the Chernobyl accident in 1986, that contaminated vast areas in surrounding countries with radiation, abnormalities and birth defects have been reported in human populations. Recently, several studies suggested that the elevated frequency of such abnormalities can be attributed to poverty and stress in affected human populations. Here, we present long-term results for a free-living population of barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, demonstrating the presence of 11 morphological abnormalities in populations around Chernobyl, but much less frequently in an uncontaminated Ukrainian control population and three more distant control populations. The presence of these abnormalities in barn swallows is associated with reduced viability. These findings demonstrate a link between morphological abnormalities and radiation in an animal population that cannot be attributed to poverty and stress. The most parsimonious hypothesis for abnormalities in animal and human populations alike is that the effects are caused by the same underlying cause, viz. radiation derived from the Chernobyl accident. © 2007 The Royal Society.

AB  - In the children and adolescents of the Russian Federation, there is an increase in the incidence of a number of nosological entities, a significant prevalence of chronic diseases, and a reduction in health quality in children. According to the statistical data, in the past 5 years, the overall incidence has increased by 16% in children (aged 0-14 years) (171268 per 100,000 children in 2005) by 18% in adolescents. The incidence of diseases of blood and blood-forming organs, anemias, as well diseases of the respiratory, urogenital, and nervous systems, and congenital anomalies continues to increase. Along with socioeconomic causes, this is all due to the negative influence of environmental factors, dietary defects, and, in some cases, poor upbringing and teaching conditions, which do not comply with the hygienic standards and sanitary rules. Under the established conditions, the maintenance and improvement of children's health is the most important state task, the provision of their sanitary and epidemiological welfare being one of the major constituents in its accomplishment. In the past 3 years, the principal state sanitary inspector has issued 17 regulations on different aspects of the sanitary and epidemiological well-being of children and adolescents. The preparation of the draft "National Program for the Prevention of Adverse Health Influence of Environmental Factors for the Sake of the Future of Children and Adolescents for 2007-2010" has been currently completed. The Group of Eight Summit has noted that resolute opposition to threats of infectious diseases, the leading cause of death in the world, is vital to the global development and welfare of mankind. It has adopted the resolution that it is essential to make specific achievements in the strengthening international cooperation in the surveillance and monitoring of infectious diseases; to intensify researches; to second the efforts of appropriate international organizations, which are aimed at effectively opposing the outbreaks of avian influenza, and to prepare for a possible pandemic; to intensify measures against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; to make the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases more accessible to the population; to avert and eliminate the epidemic consequences of natural disasters and man-caused catastrophes. Moreover, Russia has taken a number of obligations to finance appropriate programs. Of particular importance is the implementation of the Priority National Health Project involving additional immunization of the population and primarily children against viral hepatitis B (VHB), rubella, influenza, and poliomyelitis. This year, 4.1 billion rubles has been allocated within the framework of the priority national project for the purchase of vaccines to immunize 10 million children and adolescents against VHB, 5 million children against rubella, 150 thousand children against poliomyelitis with inactivated vaccine, 22 million individuals, including children going to preschool facilities and lst-4th-form pupils, against influenza. The guidelines for action aimed at providing the sanitary and epidemiological well-being of the population, may include as follows: to further improve the normative and methodical bases; to complete the development of the draft "The Principles in the Policy of State in the Healthy Nutrition of the Russian Federation' Population for 2007-2010", "National Program for the Prevention of Adverse Health Influence of Environmental Factors for the Sake of the Future of Children and Adolescents for 2007-2010" and submit them to the Government of the Russian Federation for approval; to introduce preventive educational programs into the general educational establishments in order to mould in children and adolescents healthy lifestyle habits, a conscientious attitude towards to the health of theirs' and those around them.

AB  - The new social surveillance can be defined as scrutiny through the use of technical means to extract or create personal or group data, whether from individuals or contexts. Examples include: video cameras; computer matching, profiling and data mining; work, computer and electronic location monitoring; biometrics; DNA analysis; drug tests; brain scans for lie detection; various forms of imaging to reveal what is behind walls and enclosures. There are two problems with the new surveillance technologies. One is that they don't work and the other is that they work too well. If the first, they fail to prevent disasters, bring miscarriages of justice, and waste resources. If the second, they can further inequality and invidious social categorization; they chill liberty. These twin threats are part of the enduring paradox of democratic government that must be strong enough to maintain reasonable order, but not so strong as to become undemocratic.

AB  - The Deep South has often been characterized as the poorest and most backward region in the United States. The Deep South is also unique in that it is the most racially diverse part of the United States and it has the powerful social history of chattel slavery. In this paper, we examine the relationship between race and poverty at the macro (rather than individual) level. Using county-level census data we examine the effects of social segregation on well-being. We find that indeed there is an extremely strong and significant relationship between the racial composition of a county and many measures of well-being (poverty, home ownership, educational attainment, infant mortality and so on). Second, our analysis tests for the effects of racial segregation for whites and African Americans separately. The poverty rate for whites varies little based on the racial composition of the county they live in whereas for African Americans, living in integrated or predominately white counties is significantly correlated with lower levels of poverty. Furthermore, the African American-white poverty gap is significantly lower in integrated and predominately white counties and significantly higher in counties that are racially segregated. Thus, our analysis demonstrates that racial segregation has a more negative and profound effect on the lives of African Americans than it does on whites. We conclude with a discussion of the illustration Hurricane Katrina provides of this general pattern and we offer a set of suggestions for addressing this kind of structural poverty. © by The Haworth Press, Inc.

AB  - To investigate trends in the sex odds before and after the Chernobyl accident, gender-specific annual birth statistics were obtained from the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Norway, Poland, and Sweden between 1982 and 1992. For parts of Germany, annual birth statistics and fallout measurements after Chernobyl are available at the district level. Trend models allowing for discontinuities of the male birth proportions are suggested. Superimposed on a downward trend in male proportions there was a jump in 1987 with a sex odds ratio of 1.0047 (95%-confidence interval: 1.0013-1.0081, p = 0.0061). A positive association of the male proportion in Germany between 1986 and 1991 with radioactive exposure at the district level is reflected by a sex odds ratio of 1.0145 per mSv/a (1.0021-1.0271, p = 0.0218). These findings suggest a possible long-term chronic influence of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident on the human sex odds at birth in several European countries. © 2007.

AB  - Outbreaks of chondrodysplasia in calves occur sporadically every 10-15 years, particularly following prolonged drought conditions, throughout Northeastern Victoria and the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. An outbreak spanning 2 calving seasons (2003-2004) involving numerous losses through stillbirth, perinatal loss, and poor growth was investigated. Investigations of 4 representative cases are presented here with a definition of the gross and histopathologic defects and an overview of epidemiologic data gathered from affected farms. Calves showed variable disproportionate dwarfism without arthrogryposis. Long bones were shortened and showed axial rotation. Articular surfaces were distorted with misshapen weight-bearing surfaces associated with variable thickness of articular cartilage. Physes were distorted and variable in thickness with occasional foci of complete closure. The major histologic abnormality in the physes was disorderly development of the zones of cartilage hypertrophy, with reduced number and irregular arrangement of hypertrophic chondrocytes; similar less severe changes were present in the zones of cartilage proliferation. Histochemical staining of the cartilage matrix was variable in intensity, and there was evidence of abnormal resorption of cartilage matrix at the level of the primary spongiosa. Osteoid formation and subsequent bone remodelling seemed unaffected, and diaphyseal cortical bone appeared normal at the gross and light microscopic level. No infectious agents were identified, and other known causes for chondrodysplasia in calves were excluded. The most likely cause for the syndrome was considered to be congenital manganese deficiency. Further surveys of tissue and blood manganese levels from cows and calves with and without clinical signs from the region are planned.

AB  - Yohe and Tol (2002. Global Environmental Change 12, 25-40) built an indexing method for vulnerability based on the hypothesis that the adaptive capacity for any system facing a vector of external stresses could be explained by the weakest of its underlying determinants-the so-called "weakest link" hypothesis. Their structure noted eight determinants, but the approach could handle any number. They quoted analogies in support of the hypothesis, but loose inference is hardly sufficient to confirm such a claim. We respond to this omission by offering an empirical investigation of its validity. We estimate a structural form designed to accommodate the full range of possible interactions across sets of underlying determinants. The perfect complement case of the pure "weakest-link" formulation lies on one extreme, and the perfect substitute case where each determinant can compensate for all others at constant rates is the other limiting case. For vulnerability to natural disasters, infant mortality and drinking water treatment, we find qualified support for a modified weakest link hypothesis: the weakest indicator plays an important role because other factors can compensate (with increasing difficulty). For life expectancy, sanitation and nutrition, we find a relationship that is close to linear-the perfect substitute case where the various determinants of adaptive capacity can compensate for each other with relative and persistent ease. Moreover, since the factors from which systems derive their adaptive capacities are different for different risks, we have identified another source of diversity in the assessment of vulnerability. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With the emerging infectious disease threat of pandemic avian influenza, obstetricians should be aware of the disproportionate morbidity and mortality documented among gravidas in the twentieth century pandemics. To date the majority of fatal cases of H5N1 avian influenza have been recorded in young previously healthy adults, reminiscent of the epidemiology of the 1918 "Spanish flu" pandemic. All providers of obstetric services and all facilities providing obstetric care have a key role in terms of pandemic planning for our potentially disproportionately affected, vulnerable patient population. This article summarizes the relevant data and frames the current threat to obstetric providers and facilities posed by H5N1 avian influenza in terms of pandemic potential. In addition, suggestions for basic pandemic planning efforts are reviewed. © 2007 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - The purpose of the present research was the estimation of probable genetic consequences at the liquidators of the consequences of Chernobyl accident in 1986-1987. The research is made on two groups of the liquidators. The first group included the liquidators taking place on the account in the branch register and working now at the enterprises of a nuclear industry. The second group included 902 liquidators of consequences of Chernobyl accident in 1986 constantly living in the Ryazan area and which are taking place on permanent observation the account in regional hospital. For an estimation of probable genetic effects analyzed the data on frequency and outcomes pregnancy of the wives of the liquidators, on condition and on diseases of newborn, on switching intrauterine development defects (IDD). The analysis carried out depending on dozes of an irradiation: up to 5 cGy; 5-10 cGy and 10-25 cGy. Received materials testify, that at the liquidators, at a doze of an external irradiation 10-25 cGy, the determined effects--period long sterility, kept at a part them till 3 years come to light. The set of the received data, such as depending from the dose increase of frequency of spontaneous abortions and of inherent defects of development of newborn, the increase of frequency diseases of newborn and share newborn with low weight, allows to make a conclusion about an induction of genetic effects in sexual cells of the liquidators of consequences of Chernobyl accident at dozes of an external irradiation more than 10 cGy. Taking into account high biological efficiency of alpha-radiation (K = 20), and of beta-radiation (K = 2-4), the equivalent effective doze male gonads (testes) in 3-5 times is higher, than estimated only from external gamma-radiation.

AB  - Hundreds of native heirloom varieties of potatoes of unknown origin are still utilized by subsistence farmers in the highlands of Peru, maintaining high levels of genetic diversity; yet these pockets of diversity paradoxically coincide with the highest levels of poverty and malnutrition. At the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000, 189 member States adopted a declaration that synthesized the priorities of the international agenda and reflected the commitments that had been painstakingly negotiated. The Millennium Declaration and the eight goals it identified have become a road map for tackling poverty, instability, HIV/AIDS, gender inequality, and violence in virtually all parts of the world. The International Potato Center (CIP)'s vision is to contribute to the fulfillment of the Millennium Development Goals, in particular those that relate to reducing poverty, hunger, child and maternal mortality, and sustainable development in rural and urban systems. New research with this valuable genetic resource targeting micronutrient levels, production, stress tolerance, and value adding for new markets is invigorating farming communities in the Andean center of origin and diversity of potato. Fe content (on a dry weight basis) is comparable to levels found in some cereals (rice, maize and wheat), but with better bio-availability due to lower phytate and higher ascorbic acid contents. A food intake study was carried out in six locations in Huancavelica to gain understanding of the role of the potato in the Andean diet, with an emphasis on women and children as the most vulnerable to malnutrition. Resulting information is being used to identify varieties with higher levels of Fe and Zn to improve micronutrient intake and simultaneously to assess the potential for enhancing Fe and Zn concentration through breeding and selection. An impressive range of 17-33% dry matter was found in a large number of native varieties, significantly higher than a control group of improved varieties, which contained 22-27% (Amoros et al., 2006). The outstanding organoleptic properties of many of the diploid and tetraploid native potatoes, as well as the relatively high contents identified for Fe and Zn (Burgos et al., 2007) and the antioxidant properties of those with high contents of anthocyanins (Culley et al., 2003.) are aimed at strengthening traditional Andean farming systems and benefiting potato farmers and consumers across the globe.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify equipment needs, utility, clinical applications, and acuity of diagnoses made by hand-carried ultrasound (HCU) after a natural disaster. METHODS:An HCU with four probes (curved array, linear array, phased array, and endocavitary) was taken to the site of a natural disaster in Guatemala as part of the relief effort after mudslides killed approximately 1,000 people. Ultrasound (US) scans were classified by transducer type, anatomic region, presenting complaint, and therapeutic urgency of treatment. RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients received 137 US: 58 pelvic, 34 right upper quadrant, 23 renal, six other abdominal, five orthopedic, four cardiac, three pleura and lung, three soft tissue, and one focused assessment by sonography in trauma. Acuity of presenting illness: 23 percent <24 hours, 15 percent 1-14 days, 44 percent >14 days. Eighteen percent were performed in prenatal clinic. Results of US ruled in 12 percent with an emergent problem and excluded disease in 42 percent. In 14 percent, US diagnosed a problem needing flu in <2 weeks, and 32 percent with a problem needing long-term observation. Transducer utilization was general purpose curved array 88 percent, linear array 10 percent, endocavitary 8 percent, and phased array 4 percent. CONCLUSIONS: HCU has a range of applications in an austere medical setting after a natural disaster. Most can be dealt with using a single transducer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined pregnancy outcomes in New York City (NYC) and upstate New York after the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center disaster. METHODS: Using birth certificate data for NY residents (n = 1660,401 births), we estimated risk of low birthweight (LBW: <2500 g) and preterm birth (<37 weeks) one week after September 11th versus three weeks before, and for 10 four-week intervals post-disaster versus these intervals in the two previous years. To corroborate regression results, we used time-series analysis. RESULTS: One week after September 11th in NYC, we observed an adjusted odds of 1.44 for births <1500 g (P = 0.07) and 1.67 for births 1500-1999 g (P = 0.01), but a decreased odds of 2000-2499 g. We found no immediate change in LBW upstate or preterm in either location. In extended analyses, we found, in both locations, increased odds of <1500-g births around New Year and 33-36 weeks post-disaster and decreased odds of moderate preterm for several weeks post-disaster. Time-series analyses yielded similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: The events of September 11, 2001 in NYC were associated with immediate increases in births <2000 g, slightly delayed decreased preterm delivery, and delayed increases in LBW among infants exposed periconception or in the first two trimesters. Stress may contribute to observed associations. © The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology. All rights reserved.

AB  - True knots of the umbilical cord are complications that can result in obstetric disasters, including fetal asphyxia and eventual fetal death. This study reports on 13 patients with a true knot of the umbilical cord in a delivery population of 967 deliveries during a 1-year period. In this group, there was one second-trimester fetal demise, four cases of fetal distress during labor necessitating cesarean delivery, and eight cases with a true knot found incidentally at delivery. No abnormal sequelae were found for the 12 viable newborns. True knots of the umbilical cord can be incidental findings; however, a tightened knot is reported to be associated with a fourfold increased risk of fetal death. Prenatal fetal surveillance, including targeted sonographic examination and Doppler studies, may identify true knots of the umbilical cord. Identification of high-risk patients and clinical expertise in the management of these patients have not been established. Copyright © by Association of Military Surgeons of U.S., 2007.

AB  - Background: Tete Province, Mozambique has experienced chronic food insecurity and a dramatic fall in livestock numbers due to the cyclic problems characterized by the floods in 2000 and severe droughts in 2002 and 2003. The Province has been a beneficiary of emergency relief programs, which have assisted >22% of the population. However, these programs were not based on sound epidemiological data, and they have not established baseline data against which to assess the impact of the programs.Objective: The objective of this study was to document mortality rates, causes of death, the prevalence of malnutrition, and the prevalence of lost pregnancies after 2.5 years of humanitarian response to the crisis.Methods: A two-stage, 30-cluster household survey was conducted in the Cahora Bassa and Changara districts from 22 October to 08 November 2004. A total of 838 households were surveyed, with a population size of 4,688 people.Results: Anthropometric data were collected among children 6-59 months of age. In addition, crude mortality rates (crude mortality rates), under five mortality rates (under 5 mortality rate), causes of deaths, and prevalence of lost pregnancies were determined among the sample population. The prevalence of malnutrition was 8.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 6.2-9.8%) for acute malnutrition, 26.9% (95% CI = 24.0-29.9%) for being underweight, and 37.0% (95% CI = 33.8-40.2%) for chronic malnutrition. Boys were more likely to be under-weight than were girls (odds ratio (OR) = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.00, 1.82;p <0.05) after controlling for a, household size, and food aid beneficiary status. Similarly, children 30-59 months of age were significantly less likely to suffer from acute malnutrition (OR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.26, 0.79; p <0.01) and less likely to be underweight (OR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.27, 0.51;p <0.01) than children 6-29 months of a, after adjusting for the other, aforementioned factors. The proportion of lost pregnancies was estimated at 7.7% (95% CI = 4.5-11.0%). A total of 215 deaths were reported during the year preceding the survey. Thirty-nine (18.1%) children <5 years of age died. The CMR was 1.23/10,000/day (95% CI = 1.08-1.38), and an under 5 mortality rate was 1.03/10,000/day (95% CI = 0.71-1.35). Diarrheal diseases, malaria, tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) accounted for more than two-thirds of all deaths.Conclusions: The observed CMR in Tete Province, Mozambique is three times higher than the baseline rate for sub-Saharan Africa and 1.4 times higher than the CMR cut-off point used to define excess mortality in emergencies.The current humanitarian response in Tete Province would benefit from an improved alignment of food aid programming in conjunction with diarrheal disease control, HIV/AIDS, and malaria prevention and treatment programs. The impact of the food programs would be improved if mutually acceptable food aid program objectives, verifiable indicators relevant to each objective, and beneficiary targets and selection criteria are developed. Periodic re-assessments and evaluations of the impact of the program and evidenced-based decision-making urgently are needed to avert a chronic dependency on food aid. © 2007 World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine.

AB  - Congenital anomalies of the coronary arteries occur in 0.2% to 1.2% of the general population. Most coronary artery anomalies are found incidentally during angiographic evaluation for other cardiac diseases. We describe the case of a young woman presenting with chest discomfort and fatigue where echocardiography identified a coronary artery fistula. Successful embolization of the coronary artery fistula was performed. To our knowledge, this is a unique case of an anomalous coronary artery and a fistulous anomaly in the same patient. This report describes the echocardiographic diagnosis, and the feasibility of a transcatheter management decision to avoid cardiopulmonary bypass in a patient in whom blood products are contraindicated. © 2007 American Society of Echocardiography.

AB  - Background: The Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN) flight at Keesler Medical Center sheltered 36 pregnant women and their families during Hurricane Katrina to ensure that appropriate medical care would be available. Ironically, the hospital's emergency generators were destroyed during the 30-foot storm surge, while one woman with a previous cesarean section went into active labor. She ultimately underwent a cesarean delivery using battery-operated flashlights for illumination. After the storm, the damage to the hospital was so extensive as to require aeromedical evacuation of the pregnant patients and their families. In addition, two OB/GYN physicians transferred to a nearby shelter on base and provided general medical care to its occupants. Conclusion: OB/GYN physicians in the military play a vital role in the care of victims of natural disasters. In addition to pregnancy-related issues, OB/GYN physicians can be expected to provide primary and emergency care to victims under austere conditions.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the possibility of delayed health effects of a natural disaster and develop insight into the circumstances where such delays may be likely, we examined the existing Haitian Health Foundation (HHF) database of children for the years surrounding the events of Hurricane Gilbert. Subjects and methods: The HHF database was limited to records of children with valid entries that were age 60 months or younger and who first entered the HHF program between the years of 1988 and 1992. This resulted in a sample of 4413 children available for the study. The outcomes for this study were malnutrition and mortality. Results: Haitian children appear to have been immediately affected by Hurricane Gilbert through increased levels of malnutrition and mortality. Even higher numbers of pediatric deaths were recorded throughout the following year, after which the number of deaths decreased and began a return toward pre-Gilbert levels. Conclusion: Our study found substantial amounts of delayed mortality a year subsequent to Hurricane Gilbert. These findings suggest that additional planning for agricultural infrastructure support and for extended relief should be considered under certain circumstances, including situations where the affected area has food sources and infrastructure that are affected by the disaster and where the local population is highly dependent on these food sources and infrastructure.

AB  - The early medical complications of Chernobyl accident include post radiation disease, which were diagnosed in 134 subjects affected by ionizing radiation. 28 persons died during the first 100 days after the event. The increase occurrence of coronary heart disease, endocrine, haematological, dermatological and other diseases were observed after disaster in the contaminated territories. We also discussed the impact of ionizing radiation from Chernobyl accident on pregnancy and congenital defects occurrence. Changes following the Chernobyl accident, as the inhabitants migration from contaminated regions, political and economic conversions, led to depression, anxiety, and even to "epidemic" of mental diseases. Increased suicide rate, car accidents, alcohol and drug abuse have been observed in this population. Nowadays vegetative neurosis is more often diagnosed in Ukrainian children. Epidemiological studies were conducted on the ionising radiation effect on the health and on the dose of received radiation after Chernobyl accident face numerous problems as the absence of reliable data regarding diseases in the contaminated territories.

AB  - Background: The human secondary sex ratio reportedly falls in populations subjected to exogenous stressors such as earthquakes or political and social upheavals. Explanations of the association include reduced conception of males and increased fetal deaths among males. The latter explanation has been supported by research reporting that the sex ratio in California fell 3 months, but not 8, 9 or 10 months, after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. California's distance from the attacks raises the questions of whether the results arose from chance and would be found elsewhere. We contribute to the literature by testing the association between the secondary sex ratio and the events of September 11 in New York City. Methods: We replicate the California tests by applying interrupted time-series methods, which control for secular trends, seasonality and other forms of autocorrelation, to 91 cohorts born in New York City during 28-day periods from January 1996 to June 2002. Results: As hypothesized, the sex ratio in New York City in the period 1 January to 28 January 2002 fell to 1, which was the lowest observed value during the test period and significantly (i.e. P < 0.01, two-tailed test) below the value expected from history. Conclusions: Our findings support the male fetal loss explanation of the association between exogenous population shocks and the secondary sex ratio. © 2006 Oxford University Press.

AB  - Literature speculating on the fetal origins of later life morbidity often invokes the "damaged cohort" theory, i.e., that maternal responses to exogenous shocks induce "stress reactivity" in fetuses and thereby shorten the lifespan of males in utero during stressful times. A rival, or "culled cohort," theory posits that exogenous shocks to gravid females induce spontaneous abortions of frail male fetuses, leaving relatively hardy survivors who enjoy, on average, lifespan longer than males in less stressed birth cohorts. A recent test based on archival data from Sweden supported the culled cohort theory. Several characteristics of the Swedish data, however, raise questions regarding the external validity of the findings. We repeat the test with data from Denmark, Iceland, and England and Wales. We use time-series methods that control for trends, seasonal cycles, and other forms of autocorrelation that could confound the test. None of the results supports the "damaged cohort" theory. Consistent with the Swedish findings and with evolutionary theory, we find support in Iceland and England and Wales for the "culled cohort" theory. We discuss the implications of our findings for basic research as well as for public health. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background: The Chernobyl accident in 1986 caused widespread radioactive contamination and enormous concern. Twenty years later, the World Health Organization and the International Atomic Energy Authority issued a generally reassuring statement about the consequences. Accurate assessment of the consequences is important to the current debate on nuclear power. Objectives: Our objectives in this study were to evaluate the health impact of the Chernobyl accident, assess the international response to the accident, and consider how to improve responses to future accidents. Discussion: So far, radiation to the thyroid from radioisotopes of iodine has caused several thousand cases of thyroid cancer but very few deaths; exposed children were most susceptible. The focus on thyroid cancer has diverted attention from possible nonthyroid effects, such as mini-satellite instability, which is potentially important. The international response to the accident was inadequate and uncoordinated, and has been unjustifiably reassuring. Accurate assessment of Chernobyl's future health effects is not currently possible in the light of dose uncertainties, current debates over radiation actions, and the lessons from the late consequences of atomic bomb exposure. Conclusions: Because of the uncertainties over the dose from and the consequences of the Chernobyl accident, it is essential that investigations of its effects should be broadened and supported for the long term. Because of the problems with the international response to Chernobyl, the United Nations should initiate an independent review of the actions and assignments of the agencies concerned, with recommendations for dealing with future international-scale accidents. These should involve independent scientists and ensure cooperation rather than rivalry.

AB  - The literature indicates that the health of women in Afghanistan is poor. In 1997 maternal mortality in Afghanistan was one of the worst in the world. Difficulties in establishing health services revolve around fundamentalist Islamic ideas and ongoing violence within Afghanistan. The literature holds advice on key behaviours for health professionals who may chose to work in Afghanistan. The literature also identifies the local level action that is occurring as the issue of women's health is recognised. Humanitarian assistance has been provided, with international aid agencies having to weigh the ethical responsibilities they hold and one agency tragically facing the violent loss of its own staff. Easy answers are not in the literature, merely an opportunity to understand, consider, and take action about what is facing women in Afghanistan and those who try to help.

AB  - Hypertension during pregnancy is a common problem, causing significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Pre-eclampsia is by far the most common cause, affecting 5-10% of primigravid women. Phaeochromocytoma is a rare endocrine tumour causing hypersecretion of noradrenaline, adrenaline and/or dopamine. It is extremely rare during pregnancy and may be misdiagnosed with potentially catastrophic consequences. Delayed diagnosis remains a significant source of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Recognition is critical, as the majority of maternal deaths have occurred when the diagnosis has been overlooked. Diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma is achieved by detecting increased catecholamines and metabolites (metanephrine and normetanephrine) on 24-h urine collection, as these levels are unaffected by pregnancy or pre-eclampsia. Definitive treatment of phaeochromocytoma is surgical and the laparoscopic approach has been shown to be safe and is preferred for most phaeochromocytomas. Medical preparation and treatment of hypertension is essential for safe surgery. Timing of adrenalectomy is either during the second trimester or as a staged procedure after Caesarean section delivery. © 2006 The Authors.

AB  - This year marks the 20th anniversary of the world's most notorious nuclear disaster. At least 19 million hectares were heavily contaminated in Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. A report on the health impacts of Chornobyl by the UN Chernobyl Forum said only 50 deaths could be from Chornobyl while 4,000 will die as a result of the accident. A documentary film "Chernobyl Heart" reports the incidence of thyroid cancer is 10,000 times higher than before the accident and Chernobyl.info states that congenital birth defects in Gomel have increased to 250 percent since the accident. The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), the trade association and lobbying arm of the American nuclear power industry assures that a Chornobyl-type of accident is highly unlikely in the United States because of key differences in U.S. reactor design, regulation, and emergency preparedness. However, new reactor designs are still on the verge of investigation if it is really of reliable. In the light-water reactors, uranium fuel is loaded into the reactor where after a while, all of the fissionable material in the uranium fuel is used up. With so much used fuel, American nuclear power plants is estimated to create 105,000 metric tons of spent fuel which is so deadly that it must be completely isolated from the environment for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years. As a matter of fact, no country has yet successfully dealt with its high-level nuclear waste.

AB  - Shallow groundwater is the main source for drinking water in Kabul. It comes from a multitude of shallow handpumped wells spread over the whole city area. The groundwater is characterised by slightly oxic redox conditions. Interactions with aquifer carbonates lead to high degrees of hardness and near-neutral pH. The mostly negative water budget of the Kabul basin results in strong evaporation which leads to an increase in salt content and some undesirable constituents, including borate. Several years of drought have aggravated this problem. The shallow groundwater in the city has received tremendous amounts of pollutants due to a lack of proper waste and wastewater disposal. Common indicators are elevated concentrations of nutrients such as nitrate and faecal bacteria. The high infant mortality can at least partially be attributed to insufficient water hygiene. Acid generated during the mineralization of the waste water is hidden due to the strong pH buffering capacity. Redox and pH conditions preclude significant mobilisation of trace metals and metalloids.

AB  - Twenty years after the Chernobyl disaster, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organisation are trying to file Chernobyl away as a minor affair. "No cause for concern" is how they put it. Doctors and patients in the Chernobyl region see things very differently: The cancer rate has clearly increased; thyroid illness is more frequent; infant mortality has shot up; genetic defects and malformations are increasing. The worst affected are the "liquidators" and their children. There is no denying that this is due to the radiation that escaped into the atmosphere in the disaster's aftermath.

AB  - Micronutrient deficiencies represent a largely invisible, but often devastating, form of malnutrition that is particularly prevalent among WFP's beneficiary populations already lacking sufficient food. Known effects of micronutrient deficiencies include impaired physical and mental growth among children, iron-deficiency anemia, maternal mortality, low adult labor productivity and blindness. WFP makes import ant, often pioneering contributions to overcoming such deficiencies through: » Careful attention to micronutrients in needs assessment and ration planning, » Delivering fortified foods, particularly to nutritionally-vulnerable groups, on an increasingly large scale, » Promotion and use of locally-produced and fortified commodities in more than a dozen low income, food deficit countries, » Advocacy for fortification at national and international policy levels. Important activities in local processing and fortification have recently taken place in countries like Zambia, Angola, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and in the context of the regional southern Africa drought emergency. Each case demonstrates that where micronutrient deficiencies are an operational concern local fortification is possible, albeit challenging. Several ongoing assessments of the impact of such initiatives suggest important nutritional benefits. That said, challenges remain in terms of technical and managerial capacity constraints, the need for systematic compliance with procurement specifications and quality control, clearer policies on micronutrient content labeling, and the need for cash resources to support many aspects associated with local processing and fortification activities. © 2006, The United Nations University.

AB  - Coordinated and effective interventions are critical for relief efforts to be successful in addressing the health needs of children in situations of armed conflict, population displacement, and/or food insecurity. We reviewed published literature and surveyed international relief organizations engaged in child health activities in complex emergencies. Our aim was to identify research needs and improve guidelines for the care of children. Much of the literature details the burden of disease and the causes of morbidity and mortality; few interventional studies have been published. Surveys of international relief organizations showed that most use World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and ministry of health guidelines designed for use in stable situations. Organizations were least likely to have forma! guidelines on the management of asphyxia, prematurity, and infection in neonates; diagnosis and management of children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; active case-finding and treatment of tuberculosis; paediatric trauma; and the diagnosis and management of mental-health problems in children. Guidelines often are not adapted to the different types of health-care workers who provide care in complex emergencies. Evidence-based, locally adapted guidelines for the care of children in complex emergencies should be adopted by ministries of health, supported by WHO and UNICEF, and disseminated to international relief organizations to ensure appropriate, effective, and uniform care.

AB  - The menial development level of children living in the territories polluted by the radioactive nuclide as the result of Chernobyl power plant damage, exposed to the prenatal irradiation, evacuated from the alienation zone, born from parents-liquidators (1st generation of the irradiated people) was evaluated. 177 children were examined. The control group included 34 children not exposed to the radiation. The complex of psychometric methods - 'D. Wexler children's intellectual test' - for 3-6-year old children in the translation and adaptation of A.U. Panasyuk was applied for evaluating the intellect rate. In the structure of the observed groups the pathology diseases of nervous system, of digestion organs and the congenital anomalies prevailed. Clinical and instrumental investigation showed no differences in the neurology status between the observed and the control groups. It was proved that the intellect of the children exposed to the radiation corresponds the age standards. However, intellectual development of the children irradiated in the prenatal period and children evacuated from the 2nd zone of radioactive pollution (or living there) has a tendency to its decreasing. The determining role of social, of economic and of biologic factors (the parents' education, the region of living, the birth weight) in the intellect development was indicated.

AB  - Almost 30 years have passed from the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster on 26th April 1986 but the consequences of this accident on human health will continue to trouble the people all over the world. The scientific discussions about the importance of the Chernobyl accident as a reason for a lot of congenital anomalies and some malignant tumors in humans will also go on. The aim of our study was a comparative examination of the congenital anomalies before and directly after the Chernobyl disaster in the early and later periods of time. For the study post mortem material of the Department of general and clinical pathology at the Medical University of Plovdiv was used. Eight hundred seventy eight cases of newborns with congenital anomalies for a 24-year period (1981-2004) were reviewed. The number of the congenital anomalies was compared qualitatively in general and in systems. Equal 5-year intervals of time were compared to a control 5-year period before the Chernobyl accident. The data were statistically processed using different statistical methods. The comparative study of the number of the congenital anomalies did not show a statistically significant increase in relation to the nuclear accident.

AB  - Objective: To investigate trends in child malnutrition in six countries in southern Africa, in relation to the HIV epidemic and drought in crop years 2001/2 and 2002/3. Design: Epidemiological analysis of sub-national and national surveys with related data. Setting: Data from Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe, compiled and analysed under UNICEF auspices. Subjects: Secondary data: children 0-5 years for weight-for-age; HIV prevalence data from various sources especially antenatal clinic surveillance. Results: Child nutritional status as measured by prevalence of underweight deteriorated from 2001 onwards in all countries except Lesotho, with very substantial increases in some provinces/districts (e.g. from 5 to 20% in Maputo (Mozambique, 1997-2002), 17 to 32% in Copperbelt (Zambia, 1999-2001/2) and 11 to 26% in Midlands province (Zimbabwe, 1999-2002)). Greater deterioration in underweight occurred in better-off areas. Areas with higher HIV/AIDS prevalences had (so far) lower malnutrition rates (and infant mortality rates), presumably because more modern areas - with greater reliance on trade and wage employment - have more HIV/AIDS. Areas with higher HIV/AIDS showed more deterioration in child nutrition. A significant area-level interaction was found of HIV/AIDS with the drought period, associated with particularly rapid deterioration in nutritional status. Conclusions: First, the most vulnerable may be households in more modern areas, nearer towns, to whom resources need to be directed. Second, the causes of this vulnerability need to be investigated. Third, HIV/AIDS amplifies the effect of drought on nutrition, so rapid and effective response will be crucial if drought strikes again. Fourth, expanded nutritional surveillance is now needed to monitor and respond to deteriorating trends. Finally, with or without drought, new means are needed of bringing help, comfort and assistance to the child population. © The Authors 2005.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic pollutants released by the World Trade Center (WTC) fires and various urban combustion sources. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a representative member of the class of PAHs. PAH-DNA adducts, or BaP-DNA adducts as their proxy, provide a measure of chemical-specific genetic damage that has been associated with increased risk of adverse birth outcomes and cancer. To learn whether PAHs from the WTC disaster increased levels of genetic damage in pregnant women and their newborns, we analyzed BaP-DNA adducts in maternal (n = 170) and umbilical cord blood (n = 203) obtained at delivery from nonsmoking women who were pregnant on 11 September 2001 and were enrolled at delivery at three downtown Manhattan hospitals. The mean adduct levels in cord and maternal blood were highest among newborns and mothers who resided within 1 mi of the WTC site during the month after 11 September, intermediate among those who worked but did not live within this area, and lowest in those who neither worked nor lived within 1 mi (reference group). Among newborns of mothers living within 1 mi of the WTC site during this period, levels of cord blood adducts were inversely correlated with linear distance from the WTC site (p = 0.02). To learn whether PAHs from the WTC disaster may have affected birth outcomes, we analyzed the relationship between these outcomes and DNA adducts in umbilical cord blood, excluding preterm births to reduce variability. There were no independent fetal growth effects of either PAH-DNA adducts or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), but adducts in combination with in utero exposure to ETS were associated with decreased fetal growth. Specifically, a doubling of adducts among ETS-exposed subjects corresponded to an estimated average 276-g (8%) reduction in birth weight (p = 0.03) and a 1.3-cm (3%) reduction in head circumference (p = 0.04). The findings suggest that exposure to elevated levels of PAHs, indicated by PAH-DNA adducts in cord blood, may have contributed to reduced fetal growth in women exposed to the WTC event.

AB  - Since the 1940s, diaethylstilbestrol (DES) has been used by millions of pregnant women to prevent miscarriages and many other disorders in pregnancy. In 1971, it became clear that this apparently innocent treatment proved to be a time bomb for the infants exposed to DES during the first trimester of pregnancy. DES is now associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCAC) of the vagina and cervix, and reproductive anomalies. This article summarises the potential long-term health implications of DES on the mother, DES daughters and DES sons, and the possible side effects on the third generation. Health care professionals have to know the history of DES to prevent future disasters with drugs prescribed. © Springer 2005.

AB  - On December 3 1984, more than 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, immediately killing at least 3,800 people and causing significant morbidity and premature death for many thousands more. The company involved in what became the worst industrial accident in history immediately tried to dissociate itself from legal responsibility. Eventually it reached a settlement with the Indian Government through mediation of that country's Supreme Court and accepted moral responsibility. It paid $470 million in compensation, a relatively small amount of based on significant underestimations of the long-term health consequences of exposure and the number of people exposed. The disaster indicated a need for enforceable international standards for environmental safety, preventative strategies to avoid similar accidents and industrial disaster preparedness. Since the disaster, India has experienced rapid industrialization. While some positive changes in government policy and behavior of a few industries have taken place, major threats to the environment from rapid and poorly regulated industrial growth remain. Widespread environmental degradation with significant adverse human health consequences continues to occur throughout India. © 2005 Broughton; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - There exists considerable research on the effects of prenatal maternal stress on offspring. Animal studies, using random assignment to experimental and control groups, demonstrate the noxious effects of prenatal maternal stress on physical, behavioural and cognitive development. The generalizability of these results to humans is problematic given that cognitive attributions moderate reactions to stressors. In humans, researchers have relied upon maternal anxiety or exposure to life events as proxies for the stressors used with animals. Yet, the associations between maternal anxiety or potentially non-independent life events and problems in infants are confounded by genetic transmission of temperament from mother to child. We summarize the literature on prenatal maternal stress and infant cognitive development, leading to the conclusion that the human literature lacks the ability to separate the effects of the objective exposure to a stressor and the mother's subjective reaction. We then describe our prospective Project Ice Storm in which we are following 150 children who were exposed in utero to a natural disaster. We demonstrate significant effects of the objective severity of exposure on cognitive and language development at age two years with important moderating effects of the timing during pregnancy. The implications of our findings are discussed. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

AB  - This article examines the social and behavioural consequences of the Orissa supercyclone. Theory-driven secondary data were analysed at the macro level, covering the period from 1997 to 2001, of the cyclone-affected districts and of the state. The transient consequences were sudden upsurge in infant deaths and admission of psychiatric patients to the state hospital immediately following the disaster. The non-transient consequences were decreasing paddy productivity, fish production, enrolment in primary schools, and increasing loans, consumption of fertilisers, greater numbers of general patients in the state hospital, and increased paan and tobacco consumption that persisted for more than a year. © 2005, Sage Publications India Pvt.

AB  - Dependence of damage estimates upon assumptions of economic growth and technological development. • Greater economic growth could, by increasing emissions, lead to greater damages from climate change. On the other hand, by increasing wealth and advancing technological development and human capital, economic growth would also increase a society's adaptive capacity and reduce those damages. Although analyses of the impacts (or damages) of climate change generally incorporate economic growth into the emissions and climate change scenarios that they use as inputs, these analyses do not adequately account for the increase in adaptive capacity resulting from that very growth. Because of this inconsistency, these analyses generally tend to overstate impacts. • For instance, the average GDP per capita for developing countries in 2100 is projected to be $11,000 (in 1990 US$, at market exchange rates) under A2, the slowest economic growth scenario, and $66,500 under A1, the scenario with both the greatest economic growth and largest climate change. By comparison, in 1990 the GDP per capita for Greece, for example, was $8,300 while Switzerland, the country with the highest income level at that time, had a GDP per capita of $34,000. Based on historical experience, one should expect that at the high levels of GDP per capita projected by the IPCC scenarios in 2100, wealth-driven increases in adaptive capacity alone should virtually eliminate damages from many climate-sensitive hazards, e.g., malaria and hunger, whether or not these damages are caused by climate change. • Current damage estimates are inflated further because they usually do not adequately account for secular (time-dependent) improvements in technology that, if history is any guide, ought to occur in the future unrelated to economic development. • A compelling argument for reducing greenhouse gases is that it would help developing countries cope with climate change. It is asserted that they need this help because their adaptive capacity is weak. Although often true today, this assertion becomes increasingly invalid in the future if developing countries become wealthier and more technologically advanced, per the IPCC's scenarios. Damage assessments frequently overlook this. Are scen ario storylines internally consistent in light of historical experience? • Regardless of whether the economic growth assumptions used in the IPCC scenarios are justified, their specifications regarding the relationship between wealth and technological ability are, in general, inconsistent with the lessons of economic history. They assume that the less wealthy societies depicted by the B1 and B2 scenarios would have greater environmental protection and employ cleaner and more efficient technologies than the wealthier society characterized by the A1F1 scenario. This contradicts general experience in the real world, where richer countries usually have cleaner technologies. • Under the IPCC scenarios, the richer A1 world has the same population as the poorer B1 world, but in fact total fertility rates - a key determinant of population growth rates - are, by and large, lower for richer nations and, over time, have dropped for any given level of GDP per capita (Goklany 2001a). Merits of reallocating expenditures from mitigation to international development • Halting climate change at its 1990 level would annually cost substantially more than the $165 billion estimated for the minimally-effective Kyoto Protocol. According to DEFRA-sponsored studies, in 2085, which is at the limit of the foreseeable future, such a halt would reduce the total global population at risk (PAR) due to both climate change and non-climate-change-related causes by 3 percent for malaria, 21 percent for hunger, and 86 percent for coastal flooding, although the total PAR for water shortage might well increase. • The benefits associated with halting climate change - and more - can be obtained more economically through "focused adaptation", i.e., activities focused on reducing vulnerabilities to the above noted climate-sensitive hazards, or through broadly advancing sustainable development in developing countries by meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. In fact, such efforts, which together could annually cost donor countries $150 billion according to UN Millennium Project and World Health Organization studies, should reduce global malaria, hunger, poverty, and lack of access to safe water and sanitation by 50 percent (each); reduce child and maternal mortality by at least 66 percent; provide universal primary education; and reverse growth in AIDS/HIV, and other major diseases. • These numbers also indicate that no matter how important climate change might be in this century, for the next several decades it would be far more beneficial for human well-being, especially in developing countries, to deal with non-climate change related factors. • Not only would either focused adaptation or adherence to the MDGs provide greater benefits at lesser costs through the foreseeable future than would any emission reduction scheme, they would help solve today's urgent problems sooner and more certainly. Equally important, they would also increase the ability to deal with tomorrow's problems, whether they are caused by climate change or other factors. None of these claims can be reasonably made on behalf of any mitigation scheme today. • Accordingly, over the next few decades the focus of climate policy should be to: (a) broadly advance sustainable development, particularly in developing countries since that would generally enhance their adaptive capacity to cope with the many urgent problems they currently face, including many that are climate-sensitive, (b) specifically reduce vulnerabilities to climate-sensitive problems that are urgent today and might be exacerbated by future climate change, and (c) implement "no-regret" emission reduction measures, while (d) concurrently striving to expand the universe of no-regret options through research and development to increase the variety and cost-effectiveness of available mitigation options. Ancillary benefits associated with greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. • Some GHG emission control options might provide substantial co-benefits by concurrently reducing problems not directly caused by climate change (e.g., air pollution or lack of sustained economic growth, especially in developing countries). However, in both these instances, the same, or greater, level of co-benefits can be obtained more economically by directly attacking the specific (non-climate change related) problems rather than indirectly through greenhouse gas control. On the other hand, a direct assault on the numerous climate-sensitive hurdles to sustainable development (e.g., hunger, malaria, and many natural disasters) would, as indicated, provide greater benefits more cost-effectively than would efforts to mitigate climate change.

AB  - The Chernobyl accident had combined effects of radiation and iodine deficiency (ID) on pregnancy. The establishment of a role of each of these factors in the genesis of comorbidity is of fundamental importance in the assessment of a radiation risk and in the development of goal-oriented preventive measures for reproductive health and antenatal development of an infant. The problem of impact of ID on fetal radiation damages is mainly that on radiation damages to the thyroid. The solution of this problem assumes particular topicality if radiation damages are due to the incorporation of radioactive iodine. The findings are indicative of the summation of thyroid abnormalities characteristic for each influencing factor. There is a more pronounced biological effect of radioactive iodine in the thyroid in ID.

AB  - Background: Natural and man-made disasters as well as declining economies appear to coincide with reduced odds of male live births among humans (i.e. lower secondary sex ratio). This association has been attributed to excess death of males in gestation and to reduced conception of males. We attempt to empirically discriminate between these two attributions by testing the hypotheses that the attacks of September 11, 2001 were followed in California first by higher fetal death sex ratios and later by lower sex ratios among very low weight births and total live births. Methods: We apply interrupted time-series methods to the fetal death, very low birth weight, and secondary sex ratios. The methods control for trends, seasonal cycles, and other forms of autocorrelation that could induce spurious associations. Results: Findings support the excess death explanation in that the fetal death sex ratio reached its highest level in the 6 year test period in October and November of 2001, while the very low weight birth sex ratio dropped to its lowest level in 14 years in December of 2001. The secondary sex ratio exhibited its second lowest value in 14 years in December of 2001. No support was found for the reduced conception explanation in that the sex ratio did not differ from expected values 9, 10 or 11 months after the attacks. Conclusions: We infer support for the excess death explanation at the expense of the reduced conception explanation. We also describe the implications of our findings for public health planning. © The Author 2005.

AB  - The process whereby a stimulus or stress at a critical or sensitive period of development has long-term effects is termed "programming." Studies in humans and animals convincingly demonstrate that environmental perturbations in utero may permanently change organ structure and metabolism and/or alter homeostatic regulatory mechanisms among the offspring. These programmed changes may be the origins of adult diseases, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. Throughout evolution and development, humans and animals have been exposed to two common environmental stresses, drought and famine. Notably, drought-induced water deprivation is associated with dehydration anorexia and thus a concomitant potential nutrient stress. Our laboratory has performed studies among pregnant rat and sheep in which we simulate drought conditions via maternal dehydration and famine conditions via nutrient restriction. Maternal dehydration results in low-birth-weight offspring, which demonstrate gender-specific plasma hypernatremia and hypertonicity and arterial hypertension. Gestational nutrient restriction also resulted in low-birth-weight offspring. If permitted rapid catch-up growth by nutrient availability, these offspring demonstrate evidence of increased body weight and body fat, and leptin resistance as adults. Conversely, if the catch-up growth is delayed by nutrition restriction, the offspring exhibit normal body weight, body fat, and plasma leptin levels as adults. These studies indicate that osmoregulatory and cardiovascular homeostasis and phenotypic predisposition to obesity may be programmed in utero. Importantly, these results suggest that programming effects. may be either potentiated or prevented by interventions during the neonatal period.

AB  - The effects of prenatal exposure to pollutants from the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster on fetal growth and subsequent health and development of exposed children remain a source of concern. We assessed the impact of gestational timing of the disaster and distance from the WTC in the 4 weeks after 11 September on the birth outcomes of 300 nonsmoking women who were pregnant at the time of the event. They were recruited at delivery between December 2001 and June 2002 from three hospitals close to the WTC site. Residential and work addresses of all participants for each of the 4 weeks after 11 September 2001 were geocoded for classification by place and timing of exposure. Average daily hours spent at each location were based on the women's reports for each week. Biomedical pregnancy and delivery data extracted from the medical records of each mother and newborn included medical complications, type of delivery, length of gestation, birth weight, birth length, and head circumference. Term infants born to women who were pregnant on 11 September 2001 and who were living within a 2-mile radius of the WTC during the month after the event showed significant decrements in term birth weight (-149 g) and birth length (-0.82 cm), compared with infants born to the other pregnant women studied, after controlling for sociodemographic and biomedical risk factors. The decrements remained significant with adjustment for gestational duration (-122 g and -0.74 cm, respectively). Women in the first trimester of pregnancy at the time of the WTC event delivered infants with significantly shorter gestation (-3.6 days) and a smaller head circumference (-0.48 cm), compared with women at later stages of pregnancy, regardless of the distance of their residence or work sites from the WTC. The observed adverse effects suggest an impact of pollutants and/or stress related to the WTC disaster and have implications for the health and development of exposed children.

AB  - Neonatal mortality is intolerably high in developing countries and in situations of crisis or disaster as a result of inequity, poverty, and lack of health care services. A series of effective, low-cost interventions, based on appropriate technologies can be used to address the main causes of neonatal deaths. Among these interventions, promotion of exclusive breastfeeding and thermal control of the newborn infant are very effective ones. Although the effectiveness of interventions such as kangaroo mother care, newborn resuscitation, and infant massage is not widely recognized, they may have important complementary roles in providing heath care to newborn infants in adverse conditions. © 2004 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

AB  - Women and children bear the greatest burden in the midst of war and long-term disasters. Complex humanitarian emergencies are characterized by social disruption, armed conflict, population displacement, collapse of public health infrastructure, and food shortages. Humanitarian assistance for refugees and internally displaced populations requires particular attention to the common issues affecting morbidity and mortality in women and infants. Gender-based violence and reproductive health concerns are discussed within the context of populations affected by conflict and forced migration. Recommendations for midwives and women's health care providers engaging in care for women and children in complex humanitarian emergencies are discussed. © 2004 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

AB  - With the outbreak of the thalidomide embryopathy about 1960 the drug history of thalidomide seemed to come early to an unhappy end. But soon after this disaster, due to immunomodulatory properties, thalidomide was discovered to be effective against erythema nodosum leprosum. This resulted in investigations for further dermatologic uses (lupus erythematosus, aphthosis, prurigo nodularis, graft-versus-host disease) and additionally, studies for multiple myeloma and AIDS. In spite of this pleasant development it is hard to believe that in Brasil could happen such a serious relapse of the thalidomide embryopathy.

AB  - Background: The Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the breakup of the former Soviet Union (FSU) in 1991 challenged the public health infrastructure in the former Soviet republic of Belarus. Because infant mortality is regarded as a sensitive measure of the overall health of a population, patterns of neonatal and postneonatal deaths were examined within the Mogilev region of Belarus between 1980 and 2000. Methods: Employing administrative death files, this study utilized a regional cohort design that included all infant deaths occurring among persons residing within the Mogilev oblast of Belarus between 1980 and 2000. Patterns of death and death rates were examined across 3 intervals: 1980-1985 (pre-Chernobyl), 1986-1991 (post-Chernobyl & pre-FSU breakup), and 1992-2000 (post-Chernobyl & post-FSU breakup). Results: Annual infant mortality rates declined during the 1980s, increased during the early 1990s, and have remained stable thereafter. While infant mortality rates in Mogilev have decreased since the period 1980-1985 among both males and females, this decrement appears due to decreases in postneonatal mortality. Rates of postneonatal mortality in Mogilev have decreased since the period 1980-1985 among both males and females. Analyses of trends for infant mortality and neonatal mortality demonstrated continuous decreases between 1990, followed by a bell-shaped excess in the 1990's. Compared to rates of infant mortality for other countries, rates in the Mogilev region are generally higher than rates for the United States, but lower than rates in Russia. During the 1990s, rates for both neonatal and postneonatal mortality in Mogilev were two times the comparable rates for East and West Germany. Conclusions: While neonatal mortality rates in Mogilev have remained stable, rates for postneonatal mortality have decreased among both males and females during the period examined. Infant mortality rates in the Mogilev region of Belarus remain elevated compared to rates for other western countries, but lower than rates in Russia. The public health infrastructure might attempt to assure that prenatal, maternal, and postnatal care is maximized. © 2004 Zichitella et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The Kingdom of Nepal is situated in the heart of Asia, between its two big neighbours China and India. Nepal is home to several ethnic groups. The majority of the 23 million population reside in the countryside. Although figures on many of the health and socio-economic indicators are non-existing, some existing ones show gradual improvement over the years. However the figures for illiteracy and infant mortality are still one of the highest in the world. As per GDP, and population living below the poverty line and per capita income, Nepal still remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Despite this, it provides shelter to thousands of Bhutanese refugees in its land. Frequent natural disasters and recent violent conflicts in Nepal have further added hardship to life. Less than 3% of the national budget is allocated to the health sector. Mental health receives insignificant attention. The Government spends about 1% of the health budget on mental health. There is no mental health act and the National Mental Health Policy formulated in 1997 is yet to be fully operational. Mental ill health is not much talked about because of the stigma attached. The roles of the legal & insurance systems are almost negligible. The financial burden rests upon the family. The traditional/ religious healing methods still remain actively practiced, specifically in the field of mental health. The service, comprising little more than two-dozen psychiatrists along with a few psychiatric nurses and clinical psychologists (mainly practicing in modern health care facilities) has started showing its impact - however this is limited to specific urban areas. The majority of the modern health care facilities across the country are devoid of a mental health facility. The main contextual challenges for mental health in Nepal are the provision of adequate manpower, spreading the services across the country, increasing public awareness and formulating and implementing an adequate policy.

AB  - Prenatal maternal stress has been shown to impair functioning in nonhuman primate offspring. Little is known about the effects of prenatal stress on intellectual and language development in humans because it is difficult to identify sufficiently large samples of pregnant women who have been exposed to an independent stressor. We took advantage of a natural disaster (January 1998 ice storm in Québec, Canada) to determine the effect of the objective severity of pregnant women's stress exposure on general intellectual and language development of their children. Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) scores and parent-reported language abilities of 58 toddlers of mothers who were exposed to varying levels of prenatal stress were obtained at 2 y of age. The hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that the toddlers' birth weight and age at testing accounted for 12.0% and 14.8% of the variance in the Bayley MDI scores and in productive language abilities, respectively. More importantly, the level of prenatal stress exposure accounted for an additional 11.4% and 12.1% of the variance in the toddlers' Bayley MDI and productive language abilities and uniquely accounted for 17.3% of the variance of their receptive language abilities. The more severe the level of prenatal stress exposure, the poorer the toddlers' abilities. The level of prenatal stress exposure accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in the three dependent variables above and beyond that already accounted for by non-ice storm-related factors. We suspect that high levels of prenatal stress exposure, particularly early in the pregnancy, may negatively affect the brain development of the fetus, reflected in the lower general intellectual and language abilities in the toddlers.

AB  - Women in developing countries experience the same problems during pregnancy and childbirth and die of the same complications, regardless of whether they live in stable situations or in situations of conflict and displacement. They need services and/or care during pregnancy and childbirth wherever they are and in whatever circumstances prevail. This article provides an overview of the Safe Motherhood Initiative, including the recent directions taken to prevent maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. In addition, pregnancy and childbirth care in complex humanitarian emergencies is examined, highlighting the experiences in refugee settings. In some of these settings, pregnancy outcomes have been better than in host or home countries. The challenge remains to ensure that good-quality pregnancy and childbirth care, in line with the global standards set for achieving safe motherhood, is consistently available and accessible to women affected by complex humanitarian emergencies. © 2004 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

AB  - The attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) created an acute environmental disaster of enormous magnitude. This study characterizes the environmental exposures resulting from destruction of the WTC and assesses their effects on health. Methods include ambient air sampling; analyses of outdoor and indoor settled dust; high-altitude imaging and modeling of the atmospheric plume; inhalation studies of WTC dust in mice; and clinical examinations, community surveys, and prospective epidemiologic studies of exposed populations. WTC dust was found to consist predominantly (95%) of coarse particles and contained pulverized cement, glass fibers, asbestos, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polychlorinated furans and dioxins. Airborne particulate levels were highest immediately after the attack and declined thereafter. Particulate levels decreased sharply with distance from the WTC. Dust pH was highly alkaline (pH 9.0-11.0). Mice exposed to WTC dust showed only moderate pulmonary inflammation but marked bronchial hyperreactivity. Evaluation of 10,116 firefighters showed exposure-related increases in cough and bronchial hyperreactivity. Evaluation of 183 cleanup workers showed new-onset cough (33%), wheeze (18%), and phlegm production (24%). Increased frequency of new-onset cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath were also observed in community residents. Follow-up of 182 pregnant women who were either inside or near the WTC on 11 September showed a 2-fold increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. In summary, environmental exposures after the WTC disaster were associated with significant adverse effects on health. The high alkalinity of WTC dust produced bronchial hyperreactivity, persistent cough, and increased risk of asthma. Plausible causes of the observed increase in SGA infants include maternal exposures, to PAH and particulates. Future risk of mesothelioma may be increased, particularly among workers and volunteers exposed occupationally to asbestos. Continuing follow-up of all exposed populations is required to document the long-term consequences of the disaster.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the trend of concurrent maternal and perinatal mortality at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH), Ghana, and to propose measures for its prevention.Methods: A retrospective study, from January 1995 to December 2002, of all concurrent maternal and perinatal deaths in which the woman was 28 weeks' gestation or more (or, if gestational age was not known, the baby weighed 1000 g or more) and died either undelivered or in the perinatal period (within 1 week of delivery) at the KBTH.Results: Over the 8-year study period, there was a total of 93 622 deliveries at the KBTH with 108 concurrent maternal and perinatal mortalities, giving a ratio of 115.4 concurrent maternal and perinatal deaths per 100 000 deliveries. More than 80% of the mothers who died had little or no formal education. Of the 108 mothers, 22 died undelivered. The leading cause of death was a medical condition in pregnancy along with eclampsia/gestational hypertension. Of the 86 delivered mothers, the leading cause of concurrent death was a medical condition in pregnancy. Approximately two-thirds (72/108) of the perinatal deaths were stillbirths. Over the study period, there was a rising trend of the obstetric disaster of losing both mother and baby.Conclusions: There is a rising trend of concurrent maternal and perinatal mortality at the KBTH. It is suggested that a regular antenatal clinic be established with both an internist and obstetrician to jointly see and manage women with medical problems. There is a need for improved and adequate resources to improve outcomes for both mother and baby. A waiver of user fees for maternity services may be one way to improve access for needy and at-risk mothers. Concurrent maternal and perinatal death is the latest negative reproductive health index of the deteriorating socioeconomic situation in developing countries and needs to be tackled decisively. © 2004.

AB  - Genetic improvement is a key to future increases in productivity in the Australian Mohair industry. Accurate identification of superior sires is part of this process. A progeny test was established to evaluate some prominent sires in use within the Australian Mohair industry. Angora does (n = 511) were mated to 11 Angora sires using artificial insemination in April, 2002. A total of 270 progeny was evaluated at their first shearing at 6 months of age and 246 were evaluated at the second shearing at 12 months of age. The project site experienced a severe drought for the 2002 season resulting in lower than expected kidding performance, average clean fleece weights (0.70 and 0.95 kg) and fibre diameters (20.3 and 21.2 μm) at first and second shearings respectively. Progeny sex and birth type had effects on greasy fleece weight and clean fleece weight at both shearings, on mean fibre diameter at the first shearing, birth weight and live weight at 3, 5, 11 and 15 months of age. The effect of the age of dam was evident for greasy fleece weight, clean fleece weight and medullation at the first shearing; clean fleece weight and yield at the second shearing; birth weight and live weight at 3, 5, 11 and 15 months of age. Differences between sires were small but apparent for the majority of fibre quality traits as well as live weight at 15 months of age. The third shearing, and a genetic analysis utilising dam pedigree, will expand results further and is likely to reveal larger differences between sires. ©South African Society for Animal Science.

AB  - Teratology is the science of congenital malformations. The incidence of birth defects amounts to 2-3%, but it doubles postnatal owing to the fact that many dysfunctions are not discernible at birth. Congenital malformations were already known in ancient cultures, records from Assyrian and Babylonian astrologists as well as from physicians and philosophers of the Hippocratic era are testifying it. In medieval times they were recognized as supernatural phenomenons, terata, from what the term TERATOLOGY derived. In the eyes of the superstitious people affected stillborns were regarded as monster, symbol of devil or miracle. The foundation of anatomy as a science by Vesalius marked the beginning of a reonentation. In the 17th century, when the age of enlightenment began, ideas concerning the origin of birth defects became more objective. Original studies dealing with congenital malformations became common in the 18th century. Fundamental discoveries made by microscopy placed Teratology on a truly scientific basis. Significant impetus was grown to teratological research with the discovery of Gregg (1941) that German measles (rubella virus) of pregnant women caused birth defects in the embryo and the contergan disaster (1959-1962). Congenital malformations originate from genetic factors (single gene defects and chromosomal aberrations) and environmental factors, such as radiation, drugs, chemicals, and infectious agents. The susceptibility of teratogen depends on the period of embryonal development, which is classified into gametogenesis, blastogenesis, embryogenesis and fetogenesis. The Food and Drug Administration of the USA published guidelines for teratogenetic testing (1966). There are in-vivo and in-vitro-test programmes, the latter became of increasing importance owing to the large number of chemicals to be tested and the activities of opponents against animal experiments. Although great advances were made, the problem remained to transfer results from in-vivo and in-vitro tests to the constitution of man without risk.

AB  - The long-standing higher male birth fraction is considered an indicator of reproduction stability and health. In contrast, a decrease in the male birth fraction has been reported after prenatal exposure to environmental chemical factors. There is generally higher vulnerability of boys to prenatal damage by environmental stress. We formulated a hypothesis that the Chernobyl disaster might also have had a greater negative impact on male than on female fetuses, leading to their selective loss and to a decrease in the male birth fraction. To test this hypothesis, we examined demographic data on monthly natality in the territory of the Czech Republic from 1950 to 1999. The male birth fraction was higher in the Czech Republic each month between 1950 and 1999 except November 1986, when it was significantly (P<0.05) reduced. This finding suggests a selective negative effect of the Chernobyl accident on male fetuses during the 3rd month of prenatal development. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Major congenital anomalies are diagnosed in 2-4% of births. In this paper we review epidemiological studies that have specifically looked at congenital anomalies as a possible outcome of community exposure to chemical exposures associated with environmental pollution. These include studies of drinking water contaminants (heavy metals and nitrates, chlorinated and aromatic solvents, and chlorination by-products), residence near waste disposal sites and contaminated land, pesticide exposure in agricultural areas, air pollution and industrial pollution sources, food contamination, and disasters involving accidental, negligent or deliberate chemical releases of great magnitude. We conclude that there are relatively few environmental pollution exposures for which we can draw strong conclusions about the potential to cause congenital anomalies and, if so, the chemical constituents implicated, to provide an evidence base for public health and clinical practice. A precautionary approach should be adopted at both community and individual level. In order to prevent congenital anomalies, one must reduce exposure to potential teratogens before pregnancy is recognized (i.e. preconceptionally and in the first few weeks of pregnancy). It is a challenge to develop effective strategies for preconceptional care within the primary care framework. Prenatal service providers and counsellors need to be aware of the uncertainties regarding environmental pollution when addressing parental concerns.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether prenatal stress affects the pituitary-testicular axis in relation to testicular descent in rat fetuses, as maternal stress can alter the plasma testosterone concentration and inhibit testicular descent in male rat fetuses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pregnant rats were divided into two groups and kept in reverse light-dark cycles, with lights-off at 08.00 hours and on at 20.00 hours. In group 1, 15 pregnant females were placed three times daily for 60 min each session in plastic rat-holders (13 x 6 x 8 cm) illuminated by two 150-W flood lights during the dark phase, from day 14 to 18 of gestation. In group 2, 10 pregnant females were not handled and thus were used as controls. At 19 days of gestation, five pregnant rats had a Caesarean section in each group, and both testes and the pituitary gland were removed from male fetuses at 10.00-11.00 hours. The tissue homogenates were analysed for testicular testosterone and pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) by a radioimmunoassay. Thereafter, at 21 and 30 days of age, testicular descent was assessed in the remaining male offspring. Student's t- and the chi-square test were used to assess the results. RESULTS: The mean (SD) concentration of fetal testicular testosterone was significantly lower in group 1, at 312.9 (26.2) pg/mg, than in group 2, at 532.5 (18.2) pg/mg (P < 0.05); that of pituitary LH was also significantly lower in group 1, at 130.6 (22.7) and 295.6 (35.2) pg/ mg, respectively (P < 0.05). The completion rate of testicular descent was 14% in group 1 (36 male rats) and 64% in group 2 (28 male rats) at 21 days old, and thereafter they were 81% and 100%, respectively at 30 days old (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Maternal stress might inhibit the pituitary-testicular axis, thereby resulting in abnormal testicular descent in male fetuses.

AB  - There are various reasons for and ways of fostering infants and children in different parts of the world. In a traditional society, for example among Australian Aboriginals, children who have been subjected to catastrophes such as maternal death are taken care of in their extended families, whereas children in the Western world are fostered mainly because of adverse psychosocial factors such as abuse or neglect. In transitional societies and urban slums, where there are few protective mechanisms, the sufferings of orphans may be extreme and they run a great risk of being exploited in various ways or of becoming involved in criminal street gangs. Conclusion: The fostering of infants and children around the world creates many yet unanswered challenges. This rather neglected area is in urgent need of much more attention, especially in transitional societies.

AB  - This essay contrasts the rosy birth scenarios of the natural childbirth movement with reproductive disaster stories of members of pregnancy loss support groups and women from toxically assaulted communities in the US who have suffered pregnancy loss. I argue that both biomedical obstetrics and the women's health movement critique of it share a belief in the ability to control reproduction so that there will be a positive outcome. I show that this emphasis on happy endings (whether believed to be the result of medical intervention, or women's natural inborn powers to reproduce) exacerbates the experience of those whose pregnancies do not end happily. I show how the women's health movement's emphasis on the importance of women being in control of their own bodies is related to a broader "culture of meritocracy" which contributes to maternal blame (and self-blame) when pregnancies are not perfect. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Over 15 field seasons (1987-2001), we collected census and life-history data on a population of individually identified ring-tailed lemurs at the Beza Mahafaly Reserve, Madagascar. No significant difference was found in population size over the study period, though a marked decline in the population occurred following a 2-year drought. The population rebounded rapidly after the immediate postdrought period. There was nearly a complete replacement of individuals over the study period. Average group size is 11.5 animals, and adult male to female sex ratio is 0.92. Most females reproduce annually, and the average fecundity rate is 84.3%. The greatest variability in fecundity is found among old females. We suggest that ring-tailed lemur females follow an "income breeding" strategy, i.e., females use maximum resources during reproduction rather than relying on fat stores, as do "capital breeders." Infant mortality to 1 year of age in a nondrought year is 52%, higher than infant mortality in small to medium-sized anthropoids. The oldest known female was 18 years old in 2001. We suggest that 18-20 years may represent the maximum life-span for wild ring-tailed lemurs. Because males regularly emigrate from the population, we have no data regarding male life-span; however, there is some indication that males do not survive as long as females. Group fission has occurred three times: twice from one parent group living in the driest area of the reserve, with the most dispersed food resources. We suggest that the reproductive strategy that has evolved in this species, wherein females reproduce early in life and annually until old age, is a response to the unusual climate and environmental conditions under which Lemur catta has evolved. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - This study investigates the relation between socio-economic parental position (education and occupation) and child death in Mozambique using data from the Mozambican Demographic and Health Survey carried out between March and July 1997. The analysis included 9142 children born within 10 years before the survey. In spite of the Western system of classification used in the study, the results partly showed a parental socio-economic gradient of infant and child mortality in Mozambique. Father's education seemed to reflect the family's social standing in the Mozambique context, showing a strong statistical association with postneonatal and child mortality. However, maternal education as a measure of socio-economic position was not statistically significantly associated with child mortality. This finding may partly be explained by the extreme hardships experienced by the country (civil war and natural disasters) and the implementation of the Economic Structural Adjustment Programme that have also affected the health of women and their children during the years covered by this study. Other measures of socio-economic position applicable to the rural African setting should be investigated. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This study describes urban and rural trends of infant, child and under-five mortality in Mozambique (1973-1997) by mother's place of residence. A direct method of estimation was applied to the 1997 Mozambican Demographic and Health Survey data. The levels of infant, child and under-five mortality were considerably higher in rural than in urban areas. The difference in mortality between urban and rural areas increased over time until 1988-1992 and thereafter diminished. Possible causes of the different trends (e.g. the impact of civil war, drought, migration, adjustment programme and HIV/AIDS) are discussed. The increase in mortality in urban areas during the last few years before the survey may have been related to the immigration to urban areas of mothers whose children had high levels of mortality. Higher levels of infant, child and under-five mortality still prevail, particularly in rural areas. Further studies are needed to investigate the differentials of infant and child mortality by mother's place of residence. © 2003 The Royal Institute of Public Health.

AB  - We choose to discuss from the PTSD's point of view because this diagnostic reference is commonly used. We wish outline its restrictive sight which could prevent the professionnal from having a diagnosis of PTSD. We don't want to say there is a PTSD everywhere but it appears to us that a traumatic reading can be a precious advantage for the clinician to establish a real therapeutic relation with some patients. Post-traumatic syndrome differs from the majority of other diagnostic categories as it includes in its criteria the presumptive cause of the trauma (criterion A). In the case that this syndrome originates in war experiences, the presumed cause presents itself as an exceptional event overcoming the individual's resources. The notion of war traumatisation has been extended to other events such as catastrophes, physical attacks, rapes, child and wife battering, and sexual abuses. But the events which cause PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) are significantly more numerous. It can be seen that medical events such as giving birth, miscarriage, heart attack, cancer, or hospitalisation following resuscitation may give rise to PTSD. Further, people experiencing prolonged periods of distress may equally develop a post-traumatic syndrome without any particular event having occurred to surpass their defences. It's the case of the Prolonged Duress Stress Disorder (PDSD). The series of discontinuous stress «waste» the psychic balance and may give rise, at one moment, to post-traumatic symptoms described in DSM, without any specific stressfull event. The existence of criterion A is therefore not a necessary prerequisite in establishing a diagnosis of PTSD. It is, in fact, very difficult to predict which events could cause a PTSD, and this, especially, as the subjective aspects count at least as much as the objective aspects. The clinician should have to carefully explore how the patient experienced the event or, how he aprehended the event itself and it's outcome, if he wants get the traumatic range of a life event. The feeling of deep distress, the feeling of being trapped, the loss of control, the collapse of basic beliefs, the feeling that one's life is in jeopardy, that the physical integrity is (really or in one's imagination) threatened, the feeling of helplessness, are quite as much clues fora possible PTSD which hides behind others clinical manifestations either psychological or somatic. Furthermore, the «pure» form described in the DSM and grouping together three further criteria (reliving events, avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma, hyper-reactivity) is extremely rare in the chronic form. An untreated post-traumatic syndrome evolves with time and may present, initially, with very different pathological symptoms giving rise to equally varied diagnoses. Different etiopathogenic models propose to account for the PTSD's heterogeneous appearance and instability with time. The comorbidity concept sees the PTSD as an independent entity other independent pathologies coexist with. The typologic concept suggests that the PTSD is an independent entity which shows different clinical appearances based on symptomatic descriptions. The «cascade» concept suggests to see the PTSD as an independent entity which offers, with time, different symptomatic appearances, in evolution, because of events caused by after effects, in different areas of the PTSD itself. All of these concepts outline the transnosologic appearance of the PTSD which makes it hardly recognizable. The «chronic» syndrome is rarely diagnosed forming a real challenge to prevention. In effect, the present authors insist on the crucial nature of early detection of PTSD since the greater the time elapsed the more difficult it becomes due to the evolutionary aspect of the syndrome, which initially has more readily recognizable symptoms. The consequences of an unrecognised PTSD are serious and affect both the individual and his immediate family and friends, contributing further to the aggravation of the problems. When a PTSD is diagnosed, it can allow the clinician to further a more global care which will help the patient to get a better recovery. With patients who suffered an infarct, the treatment of PTSD which prevents their recovery will help to go back to the way they lived before the event. It has been showed how important could be the PTSD detection on the severe bumed people's pain control. Thus it seems to be crucial for the clinician to keep this diagnosis in mind alongside any other.

AB  - This article deals with one of the most consistent problems arising during crisis situations, i.e., food shortage. The author first presents the international context conducive to natural or man-made famine. He emphasizes the importance of early detection and the need for an evaluation phase using public health survey skills to determine the objectives of relief. He then describes strategies for management of alimentary and nutritional requirements in famine-stricken populations in function of the different types of malnutrition encountered. The article ends with a presentation of preventive measures that must be implemented in association with crisis management.

AB  - Body size and growth data were gathered on 387 wild brush-tailed phascogales captured between 1992-1997 in south-western Australia. This marsupial has not previously been studied in Western Australia. Compared with Victorian phascogales, those in the south-west (single region) are typically 20-30% smaller in mass, smaller in skeletal measurements, and sexual size dimorphism is less. Habitat quality was correlated with body size and the largest phascogales were found in swamp/gully systems. These findings suggest food is a normally limiting resource for this species in the south-west environment. Additionally, a significant decrease in growth and size occurred during a drought year (1994), and growth of young seemed restricted during dependency. Maternal mortality appeared high during late lactation as orphaned, unweaned young were encountered in nest boxes. In 1995 adult males were 25% less in mass than usual; females 15% less. Population decline followed and by 1996 capture rates were 1/3 of that typically found for the time of year. Recovery was not apparent until two years after drought (early 1997). In this food-limited environment phascogale populations appear particularly vulnerable to annual fluctuations in rainfall.

AB  - Following September 11 the eventuality of terrorist attacks using bags containing nuclear devices is considered possible in western cities like New York, London, Paris, Rome, Berlin, Moscow etc. However, with a modern Civil Defence programme the effects of a catastrophe of this nature can be partially limited, at least as far as Fall-out is concerned. The present paper explains the medical reasons for building anti-fall-out shelters for the larger part of western populations: from the USA to Russia. The paper also sets out a new method for classifying levels of radioactive Fall-out based on a scale of colours (black, grey, red, orange, yellow and white) whatever kind of radioactivity is involved (total gamma levels, Cesium 137 levels, Strontium 90 levels). The arrival times for fall-out in each area of the scale are fixed, whatever the energy of the explosion and the speed of the wind might be. The radioactive decay in each area of the scale, from the time of arrival of the fall-out is described with precision. Also described are the acute radiation syndrome, tumours, miscarriages and genetic diseases. A nomogram is attached for civil defence purposes showing the leeward extension of these areas, easily measurable in just a few minutes, if four parameters are known: ground zero (locality) of the explosion, the energy of the explosion, the direction of the wind and the speed of the wind.

AB  - While genetic factors play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia, environmental factors contribute to the etiology of the disorder as well. If a woman is exposed during the second trimester of gestation to stressors such as the death of a loved one, influenza infection, or natural and man-made disasters, her baby has an increased risk of developing schizophrenia later in life. A common mechanism may mediate the effects of these diverse risk factors: a stress response during a restricted period of gestation may affect fetal brain development and, given the appropriate genetic predisposition, result in schizophrenia in adult life. Findings in animals exposed to prenatal stress strengthen the hypothesis that exposure to high glucocorticoid levels and/or other components of the stress response increases the risk of schizophrenia. These clinical and preclinical studies could be used to develop hypotheses that could then be tested in patients with schizophrenia. © 2002 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

AB  - Thalidomide was first introduced to the market in Germany under the brand name of Contergan in 1956, as a "non-barbiturate hypnotic", advocated to ensure a good night's sleep and to prevent morning sickness in pregnancy. It was advertised for its prompt action, lack of hangover, and apparent safety. It has been banned from the market since 1963 after it caused the worldwide teratogenic disaster: babies exposed to thalidomide in utero during the first 34-50 days of pregnancy were born with severe life-threatening birth defects. Despite its unfortunate history, thalidomide has attracted scientific interest again because of its recently discovered action against inflammatory diseases and cancer. Its broad range of biological activities stems from its ability to moderate cytokine action in cancer and inflammatory diseases. Early studies examined its anxiolytic, mild hypnotic, antiemetic, and adjuvant analgesic properties. Subsequently, thalidomide was found to be highly effective in managing the cutaneous manifestations of leprosy, being superior to Aspirin in controlling leprosy-associated fever. Recent research has shown promising results with thalidomide in patients with myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, a variety of infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and progressive body weight loss related to advanced cancer and AIDS. Here we review the history of its development, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, biologic effects, and the results of clinical trials conducted thus far. Further research in this field should be directed towards better understanding of thalidomide metabolism, its mechanism of action, and the development of less toxic and more active analogs.

AB  - We investigated the prevalence of minor psychiatric morbidity in a group of women who were pregnant during or immediately after a major earthquake disaster and we investigated the prognostic factors that may have influenced the perinatal outcome of the pregnancy. The study was initiated 6 months after the earthquake and enrolled 171 women in a town near the epicentre. A Post-Earthquake Questionnaire, Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ-12) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms checklist were completed before delivery while the perinatal data were retrieved from hospital obstetrical records. The prevalence of minor psychiatric morbidity (MPM) was 29.2%. Women with starvation experience, higher negative attitude scores about the influence of earthquake on pregnancy and more casualties among relatives were significantly correlated with high CHQ. A significant positive correlation between the MPM and PTSD scores was noticed. Among the 115 pregnancies with known perinatal outcome, there were nine (7.8%) low-birth weight neonates, defined as birth weight ≤2500 g. Maternal history of abdominal injury, spouse casualty and instability in living condition were significantly correlated with low birth weight. Spouse casualty was the only significant factor that predicts neonatal low birth weight.

AB  - Stocking rate is generally considered to be the most important management factor in sustainable grazing of Great Plains grasslands over management periods of 10 to 20 years or longer. Most studies to determine optimum stocking rates have compared only 2 or 3 discrete stocking rates. Our objective was to determine cow, calf, and economic performance on sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia Torr.) rangeland as a continuous function of stocking rate. Replicated stocking rates of 0.11, 0.15, and 0.22 head ha1- were studied over an 8-year period. Cow weight declined as stocking rate increased in drought years but was not affected by stocking rate in wetter years. Weaning percentage was not affected by stocking rate but variation within treatment groups was high. Calf birth weight and weaning weight both declined as stocking rate increased. Comparing 0.11 and 0.22 head ha-1, calf production cow-1 declined from 206 to 144 kg cow-1 as stocking rate increased but calf production ha-1 increased from 22.6 to 31.7 kg calf ha-1. Net returns were maximized at $7.87 ha-1 year-1 at a stocking rate of 0.172 head ha-1, well within the range of experimental treatments. Net returns were within 5% of maximum between stocking rates of 0.156 and 0.183 head ha-1. The variability of all responses increased as stocking rate increased. Simulation indicated that improved livestock prices and increased animal productivity shifted the economic optimum stocking rate to higher leveis, which would put more pressure on the conservation ethic of land managers.

AB  - Intrapartum and postpartum haemorrhage are common and potentially life-threatening problems associated with pregnancy. Haemorrhage appears as an important cause of maternal death in the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths (CEMD) in successive triennial reports. The chapter will discuss the various causes of intrapartum and postpartum haemorrhage describing the typical history and examination findings for each. Treatments are also discussed. The article concludes with a brief synopsis of the appropriate steps to consider when managing blood loss. The successful management of haemorrhage relies on prompt diagnosis with appropriate replacement of blood loss, realizing that in many situations in obstetrics, blood loss may be concealed. The obstetric population is young and generally healthy. This together with the adaptations of pregnancy means that signs of blood loss (tachycardia and low blood pressure) may not occur until a large amount of circulating blood volume has been lost. Rapid onset of disseminated intravascular coagulation will exacerbate the situation and a rapid downward spiral can lead to disaster for the mother and baby. The CEMD indicates that substandard care is involved in the majority of maternal deaths and this has been a consistent finding. These are clearly preventable deaths and aggressive early treatment of blood loss, robust protocols and rehearsals of the management of haemorrhage involving all relevant staff are necessary if deaths and near misses are to be reduced. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Background. The neonatal death rate (death ± 28days/1000 live births) has decreased and the level is now so low that it has been questioned whether further improvement is possible. The aim of this study was to categorize nonmalformed infants of 34 weeks' or more gestational age dying in the neonatal period to analyze if these deaths might have been prevented. Material and methods. We used the audit method to study neonatal deaths during 1986-98 in a county population of approximately 240000 inhabitants. Results. Twenty-six neonatal deaths from a population of 41901 live births were analyzed. The neonatal deaths were found to be associated with antepartum hypoxia (six cases); intrapartum catastrophes (seven cases); intrapartum monitoring deficiencies (five cases); resuscitation and stabilization after birth (two cases); infection (one case); sudden infant death syndrome (four cases); and peritonitis (died at home, one case). Suboptimal care was recorded in 16 cases. Neonatal death was unlikely to be associated with suboptimal care in six cases, but in 10 cases suboptimal care might or was likely to have brought about the fatal outcome. Conclusion. Avoiding suboptimal care might or is likely to prevent neonatal death in 10/26 (38.5%) of nonmalformed infants of 34 weeks' or more gestational age. Such improvements may, however, only slightly influence the neonatal death rate, with a reduction from 4.4 to 4.2/1000 live births.

AB  - The primary sex ratio in humans differs remarkably from the theoretically expected equality of 1:1, and may be as high as 170 males to 100 females. A number of environmental, physiological and genetic factors have been observed to impact on the primary sex ratio: sexual behaviour, variation in hormonal concentrations, natural disasters, environmental pollutants and timing of conception. Nevertheless, no biological mechanism or interaction of factors has suitably explained this phenomenon, or that of the prenatal vulnerability of the male, the suspected higher sex ratio in spontaneous abortion and the male excesses in adult diseases related to the intrauterine environment. Knowledge of the environmentaleffects and causes of natural variation in the primary sex ratio will make possible its manipulation, which will have public health implications as well as cultural and social consequences. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Many forms of bacteria, such as anthrax, can be used as biological weapons. According to the CDC guidelines, Ciprofloxacin or Doxycycline is recommended for antimicrobial prophylaxis against anthrax for 60 days. Since October 8, approximately 32,000 persons with potential exposure to anthrax have initiated antimicrobial prophylaxis, mainly with Ciprofloxacin. Children and pregnant and lactating women are likely to be among the increasing number of persons receiving Ciprofloxacin or Doxycycline as a prophylaxis regardless of the potential danger of these drugs. Once the bacteria in question are shown to be sensitive to other antibiotics, treatment should be switched to antibiotics that are commonly used in children and pregnant women. The main consideration in prescribing these antibiotics is the fear of anthrax morbidity and mortality, as opposed to the risk of antibiotic side effects. The best treatment should be provided even though it can cause side effects. This paper reviews the information about the indications, dosage and side effects of Ciprofloxacin and Doxycycline in children and pregnant women and lactating women.

AB  - This paper updates the information on the prevalence of the disorders induced by iodine deficiency (IDD) in Europe. Thirty-two European countries were still affected by mild to severe iodine deficiency in the late 1990s. The most severely affected countries were in Eastern Europe, including Central Asia, but Western Europe was also still affected. National surveys recently conducted in 11 of these countries show that, with the exception of the Netherlands, none has yet reached a state of iodine sufficiency, though very significant improvement in the situation has been evidenced in many of them, e.g. Poland, Bulgaria and Macedonia. The consequences of persisting iodine deficiency are goitre, hyperavidity of the thyroid for iodide (which increases the risk of thyroid irradiation in the event of a nuclear accident) and subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy and early infant (with a concomitant risk of minor brain damage and irreversible impairment of the neuropsycho-intellectual development of offspring). Access to iodised salt at the household level in European countries affected by IDD increased from 5%-10% in 1990 to 28% in 1999. This constitutes encouraging progress. However, in terms of access of iodine-deficient countries to iodised salt, Europe remains the worst region in the world, as shown by the fact that the mean figure worldwide in 1999 was 68%. In Latin America it even reached 90%. Salt iodisation has to be further implemented in Europe. Until that goal is achieved, iodine supplementation in those groups most sensitive to the effects of iodine deficiency (pregnant and lactating women and young infants) will have to be considered in the most severely affected areas.

AB  - A formal definition for low level exposure does not exist. This has arbitrarily been defined here as exposures from 0 to 5 cGy. The health implications of exposures within this dose range are highly controversial since the effects are exclusively stochastic. As such, the effects can only be detected in large populations. The Oxford Survey of Childhood Cancers (OSCC) established leukaemia as a predominant effect. After the chernobyl nuclear disaster, studies in European countries have correlated perinatal mortality with radioactive contaminations which could only have raised the radiation burdens by levels which are currently regarded as negligible. The reported risk indices for childhood leukaemia arising from low level exposures are generally comparable to those ascertained for high exposures, thus posing an enigma to radiobiologists. This paper reviews the progress in various areas of radiobiological research and attempts to make a synthesis of the facts with the view to provide an explanation. The purpose is also to stimulate an understanding of multifactorial biological mechanisms. Environmental radiation exposures must be expected to be concomitant with other toxic agents which must be taken into account in risk assessment. The challenge in the future will be to realise this goal.

AB  - Chronic diseases are the main public health problem in Western countries. There are indications that these diseases originate in the womb. It is thought that undernutrition of the fetus during critical periods of development would lead to adaptations in the structure and physiology of the fetal body, and thereby increase the risk of diseases in later life. The Dutch famine-though a historical disaster-provides a unique opportunity to study effects of undernutrition during gestation in humans. This thesis describes the effects of prenatal exposure to the Dutch famine on health in later life. We found indications that undernutrition during gestation affects health in later life. The effects on undernutrition, however, depend upon its timing during gestation and the organs and systems developing during that critical time window.

AB  - The drying up of the Aral Sea has been described as the most staggering environmental disasters on the 20th Century. Over the last 40 years over 33,000 km2 of the former sea bed have been exposed creating a significant dust source. It is widely believed, but little researched, that increased dust storm activity in the region has had a major impact on health. In this paper we report the preliminary findings of a year long study into the link between dust exposure and respiratory health amongst children in the Republic of Karakalpakstan, located immediately down wind of the Aral Sea. The findings indicated that dust deposition rates across the region are high with sites located on the delta being the worst effected. However, there is an apparent inverse relationship between total dust exposure and respiratory health. Analysis of grain size indicated that dust deposited at sites located on the delta is predominantly of local origin. Although dust deposition rates away from the delta region are lower, the dust is predominantly of non-local origin and is considerably finer with high levels of PM10. These data indicate that the physical and chemical nature of the dust rather than the total amount is a more important. However, the links are likely to be far more complex, with other confounding factors such as nutritional status and socio-economic disadvantages being of considerable importance as well.

AB  - People who were small at birth have been shown to have an increased risk of CHD and chronic bronchitis in later life. These findings have led to the fetal origins hypothesis that proposes that the fetus adapts to a limited supply of nutrients, and in doing so it permanently alters its physiology and metabolism, which could increase its risk of disease in later life. The Dutch famine - though a historical disaster - provides a unique opportunity to study effects of undernutrition during gestation in humans. People who had been exposed to famine in late or mid gestation had reduced glucose tolerance. Whereas people exposed to famine in early gestation had a more atherogenic lipid profile, somewhat higher fibrinogen concentrations and reduced plasma concentrations of factor VII, a higher BMI and they appeared to have a higher risk of CHD. Though the latter was based on small numbers, as could be expected from the relatively young age of the cohort. Nevertheless, this is the first evidence in humans that maternal undernutrition during gestation is linked with the risk of CHD in later life. Our findings broadly support the hypothesis that chronic diseases originate through adaptations made by the fetus in response to undernutrition. The long-term effects of intrauterine undernutrition, however, depend upon its timing during gestation and on the tissues and systems undergoing critical periods of development at that time. Furthermore, our findings suggest that maternal malnutrition during gestation may permanently affect adult health without affecting the size of the baby at birth. This gives the fetal origins hypothesis a new dimension. It may imply that adaptations that enable the fetus to continue to grow may nevertheless have adverse consequences for health in later life. CHD may be viewed as the price paid for successful adaptations to an adverse intra-uterine environment. It also implies that the long-term consequences of improved nutrition of pregnant women will be underestimated if these are solely based on the size of the baby at birth. We need to know more about what an adequate diet for pregnant women might be. In general, women are especially receptive to advice about diet and lifestyle before and during a pregnancy. This should be exploited to improve the health of future generations. © 2001 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - At Children's Hospital of Wisconsin there is a pediatric palliative care consultation service that serves a diverse patient population, including infants. However, the value of a palliative care consultation for infants has not been well evaluated. We performed a retrospective, case series, descriptive chart review of infants in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) who received palliative care consults between January 1996 and June 1998. We specifically looked at their diagnoses, the timing of consults, reasons that consultations were ordered, what recommendations were made, and the subsequent outcomes. During the series period there were 898 admissions to the NICU, 51 neonatal deaths, and 12 neonatal palliative care consultations. The diagnostic categories for those with a palliative care referral included prematurity, lethal anomalies, and catastrophic or overwhelming illness. Reasons for the consultations were organization of home hospice, facilitation of medical options, such as do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders and treatment withdrawal, facilitation of comfort measures, and grief/loss issues. Recommendations that the palliative care staff made fell into four categories: advance directive planning, the optimal environment for supporting neonatal death, comfort and medical care, and psychosocial support. This series is a description of what a palliative care service can offer for terminally ill infants in an NICU. We speculate that such consults can more consistently and comprehensively provide appropriate end-of-life care for these patients and their families.

AB  - A comparative study was conducted in two neighboring states, Tennessee and North Carolina, to determine whether Medicaid managed care (implemented in Tennessee as TennCare) affected prenatal care, care patterns at labor delivery, and birth outcomes. A pre- and post-design coupled with a difference-indifference approach-using North Carolina as a control-was used to assess TennCare's effects for all births and for three categories of high-risk mothers (under age eighteen, unwed, or living in high poverty areas). Data from 328,296 singleton births in birth files and matched birth-death files for 1993 and 1995 in both states were used to analyze a number of variables related to maternal behavior during pregnancy, utilization of care before and after labor-delivery, patterns of obstetrical care at delivery, and birth outcomes. Under TennCare, Tennessee mothers were relatively more likely to obtain no prenatal care or to wait and initiate third trimester care as compared to those in North Carolina. Relative utilization of specific prenatal procedures declined, Apgar scores fell very slightly, and birth abnormalities increased in the poverty subsample. TennCare had no significant effect on infant mortality. Utilization reductions in obstetrical services were achieved with apparent spillovers to non-TennCare births, but without adverse effects overall. TennCare was neither a panacea nor an unmitigated disaster. It is a model worth examining, but not uncritically.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to assess the effects of the timing of stress during pregnancy on emotional responses and birth outcome. We hypothesized that as pregnancy advanced women would become increasingly resistant to the adverse effects of stress, and so early stress would have more profound effects than later stress. STUDY DESIGN: Forty pregnant women who had experienced an earthquake during pregnancy or shortly afterward were identified. Using regression analyses we determined whether the timing of the earthquake was related to an affective response to this event and to length of gestation. RESULTS: The earthquake was rated as more stressful when it occurred early in pregnancy compared with late in pregnancy, and postpartum ratings were similar to first-trimester ratings (r<inf>quad</inf> = .39; P < .05). Stress experienced early in pregnancy was associated with shorter gestational length (r= .35; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: As pregnancy advances, women become decreasingly sensitive to the effects of stress. This decrease in vulnerability may reflect increasing protection of the mother and fetus from adverse influences during pregnancy.

AB  - For humanitarian organisations, accurate data are essential to identify emerging health problems and determine programme needs. We visited 45 post-emergency phase displaced persons camps and collected three months' mortality data which we compared with organisations' routine mortality reports. Organisations reported 612 deaths and we identified 741 deaths, for a mortality-reporting ratio, defined as the number of organisation-reported deaths divided by the number of investigator-identified deaths, of 83 per cent. For the majority of camps which under-reported deaths, mortality reporting ratios were significantly higher for women than men, and for camps with central mortality registers rather than those without. In the few camps which over-reported deaths, these occurred primarily among children younger than five years of age, probably due to the inclusion of abortions and stillbirths. Despite the overall under-reporting of deaths by humanitarian organisations, the existing health information systems appear to estimate mortality rates adequately in these post-emergency camps. However, organisations should improve the precision and completeness with which they report the characteristics of deaths in order to provide valuable data to target their programmes at the most vulnerable people.

AB  - The 'foetal origins' hypothesis (Barker hypothesis) proposes that undernutrition of the foetus during critical periods of development increases the risk of coronary heart disease in later life. The Dutch famine caused by the second World War in the winter of 1944 - although a historical disaster - provides a unique opportunity to study effects of undernutrition during gestation in humans. The health of people born around the time of the Dutch famine, in the Wilhelmina Gasthuis in Amsterdam, of whom detailed birth records exist, was assessed. There were indications that chronic diseases in later life are associated with prenatal undernutrition. The associations with undernutrition, however, depend upon the time of occurrence during gestation. Our findings are compatible with the conclusion that maternal malnutrition during gestation may permanently affect adult health without affecting the size of the baby at birth. This may imply that adaptations that enable the foetus to continue to grow may have adverse consequences for health in later life.

AB  - The reproductive biology of the wild boar was analyzed during a period of drought in a Mediterranean area, Doñana National Park (Spain), during 1993 and 1994. Births were highly synchronized, most of them occuring between February and April. The average litter size for litters of about 1 week of age was 3.05 piglets per birth. This figure is below most reported for other populations of the species which are mostly intrauterine litters, hence without the effect of perinatal mortality. The percentage of breeding adult females was below 17%, much smaller than that found for most Mediterranean areas. These results stress the breeding decision of females, rather than the timing of reproduction or the size of litters, as the main adjustment of reproductive effort in the wild boar under drought conditions, which may be common in fluctuating Mediterranean climates. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Pulmonary hemosiderosis has been attributed to airborne fungi in water-damaged homes in studies of a cluster of cases in infants and children in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1997. We have searched for such emerging infectious agents in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, which is subject to intermittent flooding. Pulmonary tissue from 206 infants and young children whose deaths had been investigated from October 1978 to September 1996 was retained at East Carolina University School of Medicine. Ages ranged from premature newborns to 49-months. One hundred and ten deaths were attributed to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). New sections were cut and analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin, Prussian blue for iron, and Gomori methenamine silver for fungal organisms. Twenty-three infants and children had iron-containing macrophages. Sixteen of these had underlying illnesses, but 4 were originally diagnosed as SIDS. Only one of these had sufficient hemosiderosis to be considered as having pulmonary hemosiderosis and no fungi were present. One case without iron had fungi and was not originally diagnosed as SIDS. The single case of pulmonary hemosiderosis found in this rural area is not similar to the cluster in Cleveland. The study identities no fungal organisms as emerging infectious diseases in this area.

AB  - We examined intra- and inter-litter variation in larval life-history traits in relation to maternal weight and date of larval deposition in a population of fire salamanders Salamandra salamandra terrestris in north- western Switzerland. We also examined whether the timing of larval deposition by female fire salamanders is an adaptive strategy to the changing conditions of a temporary brook. Litters differed in mean weight at birth, weight at metamorphosis, and duration of the larval period. Mean weight at birth tended to be larger in litters deposited later in the season than in those deposited earlier. Large neonates reached metamorphosis more rapidly than small ones. A short larval period resulted in a small size at metamorphosis, indicating a fitness trade-off between duration of the larval period and size at metamorphosis. Within litters, successively-born larvae tend to decrease in body size, especially in litters with a relatively large variation in weight at birth. The results suggest that environmental factors such as floods or drying out of the brook may influence the timing of larval deposition.

AB  - The inadvertent exposure of a large cohort of individuals to hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in the mid-1950s in southeastern Turkey remains an environmental disaster that continues to fascinate and provide interesting observations concerning this ubiquitous chemical. A brief history of the exposure is presented with particular reference to the initial presentation of Pembe Yara and Porphyria Cutanea Tarda and later to reproductive performance in humans and sub-human primates. Differential toxicity is present in the oocytes of monkeys, with more severe damage identified in primordial germ cells rather than in growing oocytes. However, this observation did not express itself in women, as there was no increased incidence of premature menopause among those exposed. Germ cell toxicity remains a possible outcome of exposure, however. The serum HCB levels measured in exposed individuals predicted the lifetime risk of spontaneous abortion, not only in exposed individuals but also in the control populations, indicating that a possible population effect is present.

The adverse effect of the sanctions on the health services and on health indicators are outlined, as evidenced by, among others, the increased malnutrition among children, increased infant and under-5 mortality rates and the increase in foodborne and waterborne diseases. The situation in Iraq illustrates the devastating effects of sanctions on people, particularly children, adolescents, women and the elderly, and highlights the need for more balanced and comprehensive humanitarian programmes.

AB  - After the Chernobyl reactor accident in April 1986, rainfall precipitation caused measurable radioactive contamination of Wales and Scotland. Using risk models developed by themselves and by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the UK National Radiological Protection Board advised that no measurable increase in leukemia was predicted at exposures which they estimated from measurements of contamination. However, cancer registry data from both the Wales and Scotland registries show a sharp increase in cases of infant leukemia age 0-1 in the eighteen month period January 1st 1987 to June 30th 1988. This period is that in which the birth cohort who were in utero in the exposure period following the fallout would be in the age group 0-1. Compared with an 'unexposed group' consisting of the period 1975-1986 the Wales exposed group had a relative risk (RR) of 4.4 (p = 0.004), the Scotland group a RR of 3.7 (p = .001) and the combined Wales and Scotland group an RR of 3.87 (p = .0001). A second unexposed group, those aged 0-1 in 1989-91 had no significant increased risk although after 1991 rates increased slightly. This finding supports earlier reports of infant leukemia effects in Greece, Germany and the U.S. following Chernobyl. The data cannot entirely distinguish between pre-conception or in utero effects but also reported here are increases in very low birth-weight births in Wales following Chernobyl, suggesting a genetic component to both effects. The existence of good quality leukemia and exposure data makes it possible to calculate an error in the presently accepted risk factors for radiation induced leukemia following this kind of exposure of about 100-fold or more. The possibility of errors of this magnitude in the contemporary risk estimates of ionizing radiation effects suggests that a more cautious approach should be exercised to policy decisions about nuclear power options.

AB  - Many nations now export military health as a proactive arm of the nation's contribution to the maintenance of international peace in troubled regions of the world; and all nations are called upon from time to time in emergency and disaster situations to help out in their regions of interest. Children and young teenagers constitute some 50% of war-stricken populations. This paper explores this increasingly important role of military medicine from the point of view of a practicing pediatrician and career doctor- soldier. Many international operational deployments undertaken in the last 5 years have required the insertion of pediatric clinical and preventive health resources. Deployments to Rwanda, the countries of the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Bougainville (in Papua New Guinea), Irian Jaya (in Indonesia), and the Aitape tsunami disaster response (the Sepik region of Papua New Guinea) have all necessitated major pediatric interventions. In some operational deployments, in excess of one-third of patient and clinical contacts have involved the care of children, including clinical treatments ranging from life-saving resuscitation to the care of children with both tropical and subtropical illnesses. They have also involved mass immunization campaigns (e.g., in Rwanda) to prevent measles and meningococcal septicemia. In developing countries, at any time approximately 1 in 4 teenage and adult women is pregnant; and of these, 1 in 15 is suffering a miscarriage during any 2-week period. The implications of this audit are that service members must be multiskilled not only in the traditional aspects of military medicine and nursing but also in (a) the developmental aspects of childhood; (b) the prevention of infectious childhood diseases by immunization and other means; (c) the recognition and management of diseases of childhood; and (d) the management of the normal neonate and infant, especially those orphaned in refugee, disaster, and other emergency situations. Doctor-soldiers hold special credentials to be advocates for the protection of children caught up in armed conflict and its aftermath. In this context, advocacy to ban antipersonnel land mines is topical, because unfortunately the more than 2,000 deaths and injuries each month involve children and their families, often injured long after the cessation of hostilities. Pediatric issues are now the business of all who serve in the health disciplines in the broader profession of arms.

AB  - Numerous investigations have been carried out on the possible impact of the Chernobyl accident on the prevalence of anomalies at birth and on perinatal mortality. In many cases the studies were aimed at the detection of differences of pregnancy outcome measurements between regions or time periods. Most authors conclude that there is no evidence of a detrimental physical effect on congenital anomalies or other outcomes of pregnancy following the accident. In this paper, we report on statistical analyses of time trends of perinatal mortality in Germany. Our main intention is to investigate whether perinatal mortality, as reflected in official records, was increased in 1987 as a possible effect of the Chernobyl accident. We show that, in Germany as a whole, there was a significantly elevated perinatal mortality proportion in 1987 as compared to the trend function. The increase is 4.8% (p = 0.0046) of the expected perinatal death proportion for 1987. Even more pronounced levels of 8.2% (p = 0.0458) and 8.5% (p = 0.0702) may be found in the higher contaminated areas of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), including West Berlin, and of Bavaria, respectively. To investigate the impact of statistical models on results, we applied three standard regression techniques. The observed significant increase in 1987 is independent of the statistical model used. Stillbirth proportions show essentially the same behavior as perinatal death proportions, but the results for all of Germany are nonsignificant due to the smaller numbers involved. Analysis of the association of stillbirth proportions with the 137Cs deposition on a district level in Bavaria discloses a significant relationship. Our results are in contrast to those of many analyses of the health consequences of the Chernobyl accident and contradict the present radiobiologic knowledge. As we are dealing with highly aggregated data, other causes or artifacts may explain the observed effects. Hence, the findings should be interpreted with caution, and further independent evidence should be sought.

AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) occurs silently usually during sleep and, though remaining unexplained after autopsy, leaves footprints creating a pattern analogous to that which follows a flood of nitric acid (NO). These footprints in SIDS are associated with serious pathological changes, viz. elevated hepatic iron, bone marrow hyperplasia, hypomyelinated respiratory control centres, elevated lung immunoglobulins, cerebral hypoperfusion resembling lesions induced by chronic hyperemia, ischemia, congenital heart disease and congenital myopathy. Hypoxia stimulates the immune response and the over-arousal of the immune response triggers a flood of NO. Adenosine triggers sleep. NO and adenosine are additive as dilators of coronary blood vessels. Blood pressure collapses. Selenium increases the activity of the enzyme ferrochelatase during incorporation of heme into cytochrome oxidase. NO binds to cytochrome oxidase, inhibiting respiration. When NO reaches dangerous levels, the cell turns on production of heme oxygenase. Heme is broken down to iron (Fe) carbon monoxide (CO) and bile pigments. NO has a huge affinity for hemoglobin which catalyses NO degradation to nitrate. Furthermore, NO is a product of smoke and SIDS incidence is higher in smoking mothers.

AB  - In a community based survey of gestational diabetes in 18 rural villages of the eastern zone of Tigray administrative region, northern Ethiopia, a total of 890 pregnant women with gestational age of 24 weeks and above were examined for gestational diabetes mellitus based on WHO criteria. A 75 gm oral glucose tolerance test was performed on each subject with measurement of glucose at 0 and 2 h. Blood glucose was determined by glucose oxidase method using capillary blood (Accutrend alpha, Boehringer Mannheim). The mean age of the mothers was 27.4 ± 7.1 years. Forty four percent of the subjects were multiparas. The prevalence rate of gestational diabetes mellitus was found to be 3.7% (95% CI 2.5-4.9). The mean blood glucose 2 h after glucose load in those pregnant diagnosed to have gestational diabetes mellitus was 154.6 ± 14.4 mg/dl (J.W. Rich-Edwards, G.A. Colditz, M.J. Stampfer, W.C. Willett, M.W. Gillman, C. Hennekens, F.E. Speizer, J.E. Manson, Birth weight and the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adult women, Annu. Intern. Med. 130 (1999) 278-284). The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus in this region of the country is high as compared to other parts of Africa. The possible role and contribution of exposure of the general population in this area to chronic malnutrition as a result of prolonged famine, drought and war, to the high prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus warrants further study.

AB  - Nomadic and seminomadic pastoralists make optimal use of scarce water and pasture in the arid regions south of the Sahara desert, spreading from Mauretania in the west to Somalia in East Africa. We attempted to summarize the fragmentary evidence from the literature on the health status of these populations and to assess the best ways to provide them with modern health care. Infant mortality is higher among nomadic than among neighbouring settled populations, but childhood malnutrition is less frequent. Nomads often avoid exposure to infectious agents by moving away from epidemics such as measles. Trachoma is highly prevalent due to flies attracted by cattle. The high prevalence of tuberculosis is ascribed to the presence of cattle, crowded sleeping quarters and lack of health care; treatment compliance is generally poor. Guinea worm disease is common due to unsafe water sources. Helminth infections are relatively rare as people leave their waste behind when they move. Malaria is usually epidemic, leading to high mortality. Sexually transmitted diseases spread easily due to lack of treatment. Leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis are encountered; brucellosis occurs but most often goes undetected. Drought forces nomads to concentrate near water sources or even into relief camps, with often disastrous consequences for their health. Existing health care systems are in the hands of settled populations and rarely have access to nomads due to cultural, political and economic obstacles. A primary health care system based on nomadic community health workers is outlined and an example of a successful tuberculosis control project is described. Nomadic populations are open to modern health care on the condition that this is not an instrument to control them but something they can control themselves.

AB  - In the Roman world, the birth of a physically abnormal child was regarded as an evil omen disturbing the cosmic order ; it announced a disaster involving the whole community, like war or sterility. In the republican period, the State authorised or commanded the elimination of deformed children immediately after birth to reconcile men and gods. In imperial times, the superstitious fear caused by abnormal children fades away progressively. Human monsters are no more cast out ; they become fashionable curiosities. The deformed child becomes a freak, put on public display, an object of derision, deprived from human quality.

AB  - Objective. To investigate whether prenatal maternal stress, considered to alter plasma testosterone concentration and induce a lack of testosterone surge in male rat fetuses, has any effect on the growth of the processus vaginalis and testicular descent in male offspring. Materials and methods. Pregnant rats were divided into two groups. In group 1, the rats were placed three times daily for 60 min each session in Plexiglas rat holders (13 x 6 x 8 cm) illuminated by two 150-W flood lights from day 14 to day 18 of gestation during the dark phase of the animals' light (12 h) and dark (12 h) cycle. In group 2, pregnant females were not handled and acted as controls. After birth, the anogenital distance of both the male and female rats was measured, and the length of the processus vaginalis was measured at 7 days of age in some rats. Thereafter, at 21, 24, 27 and 30 days of age, testicular descent was assessed in the remaining male rats. Results. In group 1, at 21, 24, 27 days of age, testicular descent was delayed in the stressed rats compared with the control rats. At 30 days of age, five of 30 stressed male offspring showed abnormal testicular descent; three testes were in the superficial inguinal position and two were above the scrotum. Both the anogenital distance and the length of the processus vaginalis were significantly less in the stressed male rats than in the controls. Conclusions. Maternal stress induced a female-like anogenital distance in male rat fetuses, and caused delayed and abnormal descent of the testis, by inhibiting the growth of the processus vaginalis after birth. Prenatal stress may therefore be involved in the delay of testicular descent in neonatal rats by inducing a mild anti-androgenic effect in the fetus.

AB  - Haematological data are presented on 4104 pregnant women attending the antenatal-care facilities of two hospitals in a rural area in southern Malawi. In this area, malaria transmission is perennial and there is a high prevalence of HIV infection. The local women are exposed to drought and food shortages but experience high fertility rates. Mean (S.D.) haemoglobin (Hb) concentration was significantly lower in the primigravidae [8.7 (1.6) g/dl] than in the secundigravidae [9.1 (1.5) g/dl; P < 0.0001] or multigravidae [9.2 (1.5) g/dl; P < 0.0001]. Primigravidae also experienced significantly more iron deficiency and malaria than secundi -or multi-gravidae. For all parity groups, the lowest mean Hb levels were observed between 26-30 weeks' gestation. In primigravidae peak prevalence of malaria occurred between 16-20 weeks' gestation (38.6%) and peak prevalence of moderately severe anaemia (< 8 Hb/dl) between 26-30 weeks' (35.7%). Multigravidae showed little variation in the prevalence of anaemia, iron deficiency and malaria with gestational age. Peak prevalences of malaria were observed in April, in the post-rainy season, with values of 51.4%, 56.0% and 25.3% for primi-, secundi- and multi-gravidae, respectively. Peak prevalences of iron deficiency occurred between April and May and those of moderately severe anaemia between May and June. Mean Hb was lower in adolescent primigravidae than in any other group of pregnant women [8.6 (1.5) g/dl], including the non-adolescent primigravidae [8.9 (1.6) g/dl; P = 0.008]. Other factors significantly associated with increased risk of moderately severe anaemia in primigravidae were illiteracy and poor nutritional status (i.e. body mass index < 18.5 kg/m2 and mid-upper-arm circumference < 23 cm). After forward, step-wise, regression analysis of relative risk (RR) factors and their 95% confidence intervals (CI), variables associated with an increased risk for moderately severe anaemia were iron deficiency (RR = 4.2; CI = 3.0-6.0) and malaria parasitaemia (RR = 1.9; CI = 1.3-2.7) in primigravidae, iron deficiency (RR = 4.1; CI = 2.7-6.3) and mid-upper-arm-circumference < 23 cm (RR 1.8; CI = 1.1-3.0) in secundigravidae, and iron deficiency in multigravidae (RR = 3.1; CI = 4.3-6.9). The basis of anaemia prevention in this population of pregnant women is malaria control and haematinic supplementation, one of the most serious drawbacks being non-compliance. Although the present data are presented according to the World Health Organization's definitions of anaemia, the corresponding cut-off values for Hb (< 11 or < 7 g/dl) were not associated with malaria, suggesting that these Hb levels would be less useful indicators in malaria interventions. It is argued that an Hb value of < 8 g/dl might be considered for identifying the pregnant women at highest risk, for selective health education to reduce non-compliance.

AB  - Background. As a result of war and periodic natural disasters, Angola has among the highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the world. In response to the acute health needs of the population, the International Medical Corps (IMC) developed a traditional birth attendant educational course designed to reduce the preventable causes of maternal and infant mortality. Methods. From 1994 until 1998, Angolan traditional birth attendants (TBAs) participated in an intensive 38-hr training course on prenatal, delivery, and postnatal care. Following the birth of a child, the trained TBAs completed a registration form containing information regarding the health of the mother. Previous studies of Angolan maternal mortality served as historic comparisons. Findings. Complete data including maternal mortality data were available for 19,666 deliveries (83% of total). Fifty five maternal deaths were recorded, which corresponds to a maternal mortality rate of 293 per 100,000 live births. The average historic maternal mortality rate for available comparison groups was 1241 per 100,000 live births. Interpretation. The maternal mortality rate was reduced among women managed by IMC-trained TBAs when compared with historical control data.

AB  - This paper highlights the impact of laws and policies on reproductive rights in adolescents and young girls in Mali. The Center for Reproductive Law and the Association of Women Lawyers in the country uncovered several areas of concern on the adolescents in Mali. It was noted that 94% of the women in reproductive age have undergone female genital mutilation, also known as female circumcision. According to the report, 34% of the female adolescents have experienced pregnancy despite their knowledge that early pregnancies are critical risk factors in maternal and infant mortality. The adolescent pregnancy is attributed to their law, which permits girls to marry at an early age. Moreover, the low level of knowledge on contraceptives contributed to the increasing incidence of HIV/AIDS infection in the country. Also documented was the outlawing of abortion in Mali and is permitted only when the life of the woman is at risk. Because of this, adolescents flood to illegal abortions, putting themselves at risk of infection and complications. In response to this report, the UN recommended that Mali government should establish strategies against maternal mortality.

AB  - As of mid-1998, Azerbaijan had a population of 7.7 million people residing in a land area of 33,436 square miles. There were 17 births and 6 deaths per 1000 population, as well as 19 infant deaths for every 1000 live births, and a population growing in size at 1.1% annually. The average woman had 2.1 births during her reproductive lifetime and life expectancy was 67 years for men and 74 years for women. Azerbaijan is an oil-producing country, although the agricultural sector is responsible for 25% of gross domestic product and employs 31% of the work force. Despite its oil wealth and strong agricultural and mining sectors, Azerbaijan is struggling to improve its environmental conditions and support a large refugee population. The country's air, water, and soil are severely polluted. Air pollution stems from petrochemical plants, refineries, exhaust fumes, and the burning of untreated garbage; water pollution is the result of oil spills, leaky pipelines and tanks, runoff of fertilizers and pesticides, and improperly treated sewage; and land pollution is due to inadequate waste management. The high incidence of waterborne diseases, including cholera, in Azerbaijan is caused by the inadequate treatment of drinking water and sewage intrusion into leaky distribution pipes. Although over 90% of infants under age 1 year are immunized against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, and measles, babies in Azerbaijan are 3 times as likely to die before reaching age 1 year than are babies in the US. Azerbaijani children are 5 times more likely to die by age 5 than are US children. Living conditions are especially difficult for the 12% of the overall population which are refugees.

AB  - We examined the association between neonatal mortality and ambient sulfur dioxide (SO2) levels in the neighborhood of Mt. Sakurajima, Yamashita public health district of Kagoshima City, during the period between 1978 and 1988. The analysis using Poisson regression models showed that the monthly average level of SO2 was positively associated with the neonatal mortality (P = 0.002). When the SO2 levels were categorized into four groups to estimate the relative risk (RR) of neonatal mortality using the lowest exposure category as a reference, the RR increased with elevated exposure levels (P for trend < 0.001) and was the highest in the group with the highest level of exposure (RR = 2.2, 95% confidence interval; 1.2-4.1). Other than SO2, we also examined the number of eruptions, the amount of ashfall, and the average level of suspended particulate matter. None of these factors was associated with neonatal mortality. Although the present study suggests that increase in SO2 levels has had an adverse effect on neonatal mortality in the neighborhood of Mt. Sakurajima, it is difficult to determine the source of the SO2. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of the excess neonatal mortality probably associated with the volcanic SO2 levels.

AB  - Our findings in the Helsinki Influenza Study and the Danish Forty Year Study lead us to conclude that a 2nd-trimester maternal influenza infection may increase risk for adult schizophrenia or adult major affective disorder. More recently we have also reported an increase of unipolar depression among offspring who were exposed prenatally to a severe earthquake (7.8 on the Richter scale) in Tangshan, China. Among the earthquake-exposed males (but not the females), we observed a significantly greater depression response for those individuals exposed during the 2nd trimester of gestation. These findings suggest that maternal influenza infection and severe maternal stress may operate (in different ways) as teratogens, disrupting the development of the fetal brain and increasing risk for developing schizophrenia or depression in adulthood.

AB  - We examine demographic patterns from a long-term study (1987-1996) of the population of ring-tailed lemurs in the Beza-Mahafaly Special Reserve, in southwestern Madagascar. In particular, we focus on the effects that a severe drought in 1991 and 1992 had on the population. The population of adult animals peaked in 1991 but decreased rapidly during the subsequent drought and immediate postdrought years. In the 1992 birth season (and second year of the drought) infant mortality reached 80%, and 20.8% of all adult females in the reserve died. The following year, adult female mortality reached a high of 29.9%. Juvenile mortality in 3 intensively studied groups was 57% during the second year of the drought. We compare these data with infant, juvenile, and adult female mortality in non-drought years. We are not able to calculate adult male mortality, as they often emigrate from the reserve to the adjacent forest; however, in the same 3 intensively studied groups, 89% of the males disappeared during the 2 immediate postdrought years. By 1996, the population had begun to recover after the decline that correlated with the drought conditions. Annual reproduction, high birth rates (.80-.86 annually), early sexual maturity and dietary adaptability may be contributing factors to the recovery. Effects of and recovery from this type of natural disaster in the Beza Mahafaly ring-tailed lemur population parallel responses of some species of macaques and baboons with respect to the adaptability of edge species.

AB  - Objectives. This report examines the impact of an economic embargo from 1991 to 1994 on health, well-being, and human rights in Haiti. Methods. Data from surveillance systems for nutrition, reportable diseases, and hospital diagnoses were combined with survey data and interviews with affected women, governmental representatives, diplomats, and staff of nongovernmental organizations. Results. Changes included declining income, rising unemployment, poorer nutrition, declining infant mortality, rising mortality among 1- to 4-year-olds, decreased attention to children's well-being and education, and family breakdown. Survival strategies among poor Haitians included changed dietary habits, informal-sector economic activity, moving in with relatives, selling domestic goods, increased informal unions among couples, decreased school attendance, and indentured servitude among children. Conclusions. The implementation of economic sanctions in Haiti resulted in extensive violations of rights; the impact was greatest on the most disadvantaged Haitians. Many Haitian and international supporters of democracy were unaware of the extensive negative impact that sanctions could have. The impact continues now, 5 years after sanctions ended. Modified policies reduced some of the burden of sanctions, and international assistance prevented what otherwise might have become a humanitarian disaster during sanctions.

AB  - Dairy cows in mid lactation were treated with a controlled release preparation of bovine somatotropin (bST; Somidobove) at each of two dose rates (320 or 640 mg). Thirty-six cows per dose rate were treated on four occasions and were compared with 36 control cows (vehicle only). The effect of Somidobove on milk yield was sustained only for the first 14 d of each 28-d treatment cycle. The increase in milk solids output ranged from 188 to 352 g d"1 over the first 14 d of each treatment cycle, the increase being relatively higher in the 640-mg-dose group. In absolute terms the yield response declined as yield declined with advancing lactation, although the percentage yield response was similar at all stages (mean 18% and 23%, respectively, for 320- and 640-mg-dose groups). Milk fat content was increased and milk protein content was decreased by both Somidobove dose rates. During a period of drought, yield was adversely affected in the 640-mg-dose group relative to control cows. This effect occurred as a carry-over response to treatment. There were no adverse effects of Somidobove treatment on any aspect of animal health, including calf birth weight and calving liveweight. Further work is required to optimise bST dosage levels and patterns and to establish effects of bST on feed intake for grazing dairy cows in New Zealand. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background. Numerous investigations have been carried out concerning the possible impact of the Chernobyl accident, in April 1986, on the prevalence of anomalies at birth and on perinatal mortality. The accident has contaminated Eastern Europe more heavily than Western Europe. If there was an effect of the radioactive contamination on perinatal mortality or stillbirth proportions one would expect to find it more pronounced in Eastern Europe as compared to Western Europe. We therefore studied long-term time trends in European stillbirth proportions. Methods. Linear logistic regression was applied to model the time trends in stillbirth proportions. Dummy variables were used to account for effects that can be associated with certain years or locations. A synoptic logistic regression model is suggested for the western, central, and eastern parts of Europe. Results. There is a marked differential effect in the long-term stillbirth time trends between Western Europe (Belgium, France, Great Britain, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal. Spain), Central Europe (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Norway Switzerland), and Eastern Europe represented by four countries (Greece, Hungary, Poland, Sweden). In contrast to the western and central European trends, the eastern European trend exhibits an absolute increase of the stillbirth proportion in 1986 as compared with 1985 and an apparent upward shift of the whole trend line from 1986 on. Conclusion. Our results are in contrast to those of many analyses of the health consequences of the Chernobyl accident and contradict the present radiobiological knowledge. As we are dealing with highly aggregated data, other causes or artefacts may explain the observed effects. Hence, the findings should be interpreted with caution and further independent evidence should be sought.

AB  - Infant and youth mortality fell steeply between the unification of Italy and the 1930's, particularly due to the decline in infectious and parasitic diseases. A number of mortality crises, however, at times halted this decline: the 1908 Calabria-Sicily earthquake, the 1915 Marsica earthquake, World War I and 1918 Spanish influenza outbreak. This paper focuses as the repercussions of these events on the general survival status of young people from birth to puberty, as well as the main pathologies responsible for the rise in mortality. An analysis of differences in mortality according to sex during the various crises was also performed to ascertain whether the more difficult survival conditions during these periods affected males and females equally.; This study aims to provide a closer look at mortality peaks following the earthquake in Calabria/Sicily in 1908 and in Marsica in 1915, as well as World War I and the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic. Infant and youth mortality in Italy began to slow down and in some cases grounded to a halt during the first two decades of the century. The Messina and Marsica earthquakes as well as World War I and the Spanish flu epidemic caused unexpected peaks in the mortality rate in the early part of the century. The impact of these events on the mortality rate are analyzed by sex, age, and cause of death. Neither of the earthquakes made any distinction by age and deaths were proportionately divided among the population affected. Mortality in the 5-9 and 10-14 year age ranges had been low, and the deaths provoked by earthquake brought about a steep rise, while in the 0-4 year age range mortality had been high previously. Neither earthquake made any distinction by sex; therefore, the difference in degree of mortality between males and females weakened at every age group. On the other hand, World War I triggered a rise in mortality that was differentiated among age groups. Childhood mortality rose during this time because children suffered from various deprivations, including food shortages, poor hygiene and living conditions, and lack of care. The war definitely altered the difference in degree of mortality between the sexes in that there was a disproportionate rise in mortality among males in the first year. The fourth crisis considered is the Spanish flu epidemic, which caused a rise in mortality that was undifferentiated by age but highly differentiated by sex in that females were more strongly affected by it.

AB  - A forty-three-day-old infant was intubated by the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) staff. A nasogastric tube was in place for the duration. The patient's vital signs remained stable during 12 h of positive pressure ventilation. A Broviac catheter placement was scheduled in the NICU. The position of the tracheal tube (TT) was not verified prior to induction of anaesthesia. After the induction, the patient's condition deteriorated. The TT was found to be positioned within the oesophagus. A near catastrophe was successfully averted by discovering the malpositioned TT and replacing it with a properly positioned TT. We believe that had we clamped the existing nasogastric tube preoperatively, a noticeable abdominal distention would have occurred alerting us to a malpositioned TT. We suggest that clamping a preexisting nasogastric tube may have merit to alert one to a malpositioned TT.

AB  - Objective - To determine financial impact of an outbreak of vesicular stomatitis in the San Luis Valley of southern Colorado. Design - Survey and financial analysis. Sample Population - 16 ranchers whose beef herds were affected by the 1995 outbreak. Procedure - Information concerning financial effects during the outbreak year was collected by personal interview of each rancher and examination of financial records. Results - Affected herds ranged from 79 to 956 cows (mean, 345). Cow case-fatality rates ranged from 0 to 80%, with calf case-fatality rates ranging from 0 to 28% and overall case-fatality rates of 0 to 15%. Median financial loss was $7,818/ranch and mean financial loss was $15,565/ranch, excluding total financial losses associated with sale of calves. Primary financial losses for these beef herds were attributed to increased culling rates, death of pregnant cows, loss of income from calves, and costs for additional labor during the outbreak. Some costs were attributable to a decrease in market price for beef and a drought during the year after the outbreak. Clinical Implications - Financial losses for an outbreak of vesicular stomatitis can be attributed to effects of the disease and costs associated with imposed quarantines.

AB  - Vasa previa, though rare (1 in 3000 births), has a significantly high mortality rate. Diagnosis is usually difficult, especially during the antenatal period. However, the use of transvaginal color Doppler ultrasound has increased the recognition of this condition during the antenatal period. Transvaginal color Doppler ultrasound is a more accurate way to view the vulnerable vessels in the area of question. This diagnostic tool will assist in the management of the patient to prevent possible disaster. In this report, transvaginal color Doppler ultrasound helped to recognize and follow up a patient with vasa previa to ensure a successful outcome for both the mother and the fetus. As the antenatal diagnosis of the condition increases with the use of transvaginal color Doppler ultrasound, the high mortality rate should decrease. The importance of meticulous evaluation of the placenta during routine obstetric ultrasound scanning is emphasized.

AB  - Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is well recognised as a consequence of natural and man-made disasters, accidents and assaults. An increasing number of plaintiffs making claims for compensation alleging medical negligence complain of the symptoms of PTSD. Medical accidents such as anaesthetic awareness and stillbirths may be claimed as stressors and relatives may allege PTSD as a psychological injury following witnessing the death or suffering of a loved one. A series of cases will be presented. Many cases are entirely genuine but increasing media publicity has alerted potential plaintiffs and their legal advisers to the symptoms of PTSD which make evaluation of symptoms difficult for psychiatric experts. Psychometric tests exist to screen PTSD but research has shown that they can be falsified and it would be unwise to rely on such tests.

Little is known about the influence of flood disaster on reproductive outcomes. DESIGN: This study reviews perinatal medical problems in pregnant women during the flood disaster from Kłodzko Region in July 1997. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 47 pregnant women were investigated which injured from the flood disaster. We observed a psychosocial stress in this women. A control random group consists of 100 pregnant women in 1996. RESULTS: Reproductive outcomes include pregnancy loss in 55.3% and other severe disorders: premature delivery, missed abortion, birth asphyxia, premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine growth retardation. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial stress observed during the flood disaster cause many perinatal complications and pregnancy loss. Intensive perinatal medical care must usually be provided from outside the disaster area.

AB  - In this paper I describe maternal and child health needs in Zimbabwe, as well as existing health care delivery services designed to meet these needs. The information presented is based on a project sponsored by Earthwatch (a worldwide volunteer organization) that addressed the needs of women and infants, as well as the author’s contribution to this effort. Because of a long-standing drought, many women and children in Zimbabwe are malnourished. Poor nutrition affects the woman herself, pregnancy outcomes, and the developing child, and has far-reaching repercussions. The major problems that contribute to maternal child morbidity and mortality include nutritional deficiencies, lack of safe water, and family planning needs. Earlier surveys conducted on maternal nutrition consistently showed iron deficiency, goiters, underweight, and inadequate nutrient intake to be quite prevalent. On the basis of previous assessments, this project focused on educating community health workers on ways to assist families with nutritional deficiencies, family planning, and hygiene needs. © 1998 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Every year between one and two million African children under five die of malaria. If one adds to this the contribution of malaria to all-cause infant mortality then clearly the burden of the disease is catastrophic - a disaster quietly happening each and every year. New tools are needed urgently to support those currently available for control of the disease. An effective vaccine remains elusive. This article outlines the potential contribution to malaria control services of satellite information, which is being used by resource managers in other sectors. In particular, it highlights the lessons which can be learned from early warning systems in other areas, especially those designed to respond to famine. An appendix provides a brief introduction to satellite data and their interpretation.

AB  - The genetics and the epidemiology of Down syndrome (DS) was studied in the area which is covered by our registry of congenital malformations. For each of the 398 new DS cases which were ascertained during the period 1979 to 1996 more than 50 factors were studied and compared to those from control infants. The prevalence of DS was 1.66 per 1000; 2.2% of the DS cases were stillbirths and 29.4% were induced abortions. Karyotypes were obtained in 391 cases of which all but 23 were 47,+21;9 were mosaics (2.3%), and 14 had translocations (3.6%). Interchromosomal effect was a question in 7 cases. The most common types of associated malformations were cardiac anomalies (46.2%) and intestinal atresias (6.0%). Seasonality or time/space clusters were not observed in spite of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. No paternal age effect was demonstrated; 5.3% of the mothers of DS had 2 previous spontaneous abortions (controls 3.7% p < 0.05). At birth, the DS infants measured and weighted less and their head circumference was lower than in control infants. Weight of placenta was also lower than in control infants. In this material there were 4.5% of consanguineous marriages (P < 0.01). The pregnancies of the DS children were more often complicated by threatened abortions than in the controls, 3.2% of the mothers of the DS children were diabetic controls (1.7%), although the difference was not statistically significant. For all other factors studied no statistically significant difference with respect to controls could be demonstrated.

AB  - Decreased renal and hepatic flood flow with preeclampsia-like histologic changes was developed by stimulation of the celiac ganglion with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in pregnant rabbits. The renal and hepatic blood flow were measured after stimulation of the celiac ganglion with 10 μL (group I), 100 μL (group II) and 300 μL (group III) of LPS (10 mg/mL conc.) and with 100 μL of normal saline (group IV). The bifurcation of the abdominal aorta was also stimulated with 300 μL of LPS (group V). A control experiment was also done in this study group (group VI). Histopathological studies of kidney and liver tissue were also performed in this protocol. A significant reduction in renal and hepatic blood flow was observed in pregnant rabbits with the times and dosage dependent on stimulation of the celiac ganglion by LPS. Stimulation of the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta with LPS could not produce any changes in renal and hepatic blood flow. Preeclampsia-like histologic changes of kidney and liver tissue were also observed. These results suggest that exogenous stimulation of the celiac ganglion causes decreased renal and hepatic blood flow, resulting in preeclampsia-like histologic changes of kidney and liver in pregnant rabbits.

AB  - We investigated the possible association between the Kobe earthquake (January 1995) and the sex ratio among live-born infants after the catastrophe. A significant decline in the sex ratio (0.501) of Hyogo Prefecture in October 1995 was observed 9 months after the Kobe earthquake as compared with an expected value of 0.516 in the period from January 1993 to January 1996 (P = 0.04; one-tailed). Simultaneously, a reduction in fertility of ~6% was also observed, compared with the month of October 2 years previously. Thus, the acute stress resulting from a great natural catastrophe can be a cause of a low sex ratio at birth 9 months later.; This study examined the association between the Kobe earthquake in January 1995 and the sex ratio among infants born after the natural disaster in Japan. It is postulated that chronic exposure to environmental toxic agents of the male reproductive system could lead to low male/female ratios. Data were obtained from Hyogo Prefecture and published welfare statistics on the monthly number of males and females at birth during July 1995 and January 1996 compared to the same months in 1993. A conception during the earthquake would be a birth on October 9, 1995. Findings indicate a decline in the sex ratio in Hyogo Prefecture in October 1995. The proportion of males to females was 0.501 in October 1995 and 0.516 during January 1993 to January 1996. Differences were significant based on Fisher's 1-tailed test. Fertility declined about 6% between October 1995 and October 1993. The number of spontaneous abortions and preterm births remained the same between 1993 and 1995. The changes in sex ratio after the Kobe earthquake followed the same pattern of decline as the changes after the London smog and the Brisbane flood, but the decline appeared earlier. The sex ratio decline appeared in only about 280 days after the earthquake compared to 320 days in the other disasters. The authors speculate that the sex ratio changes may be due to acute stress and a reduced sperm motility. Evidence indicates sperm motility declined less than 1 month after the earthquake. Sperm motility was restored over a period of 2-9 months.

AB  - This brief article highlights the progress made in Bangladesh in reducing fertility and improving women's status. The mid-1997 population was an estimated 122.2 million persons. The land area is 50,260 square miles. Population density was 2432 people per square mile. Births were 31 per 1000 persons. Deaths were 11 per 1000 persons. Infant deaths were 77 per 1000 live births. Natural increase was 2% per year. The total fertility rate was 3.3 births per woman. Life expectancy was 58 years for males and females. Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world and has about 50% of US population situated on land the size of Wisconsin. Average annual income is about $240. Livelihoods from agriculture are affected by monsoons and natural disasters. Bangladesh has reduced its fertility by half since the mid-1970s. Almost 50% of married women relied on contraception during 1996-97, compared to only 8% of married women in 1975. Increases in contraceptive prevalence are attributed to the family planning program and parents' desire for smaller families. The government has made slowing population growth a priority since the 1970s. The 35,000 field workers provide door-to-door contraception and counseling. Mass media has promoted messages about the economic and health advantages of limiting or spacing births. Women continue to play a subordinate role to men, despite their improved control over fertility. Under 30% of women are literate compared to 50% of men. Islamic practices still confine women to the home. Programs are directed to improving women's financial status through credit programs. Women now hold many jobs in the new garment industry, which is the largest nonagricultural employer.

AB  - Objective - To determine the association between a leak of sour natural gas (more than 30% hydrogen sulfide) from a pipeline in a river valley and the health of beef cattle in the intensively ranched surrounding area. Design - Prospective cohort study. Sample Population - 13 herds of cattle within 4 km (2.5 miles) of the leak and 10 herds outside the 4-km zone. Procedure - Distance of herds from the leak site was determined, using geographic information systern technology. Information about speed and direction of winds was obtained from a local meteorologic station and an ambient air-quality monitoring trailer. Health and productivity data for surrounding beef herds, as well as exposure information, were collected and analyzed. Results - An association was not found between total herd calf mortality and herd distance from the leak wind-aided exposure, location in the river valley, signs of irritation consistent with exposure to the gas, or reports of odors of gas at the time of the leak. Management changes reported in response to the gas leak were identified as risk factors for total herd calf mortality. Other herd-level risk factors associated with increased calf mortality ratio included a median calving date in February and percentage of twin births for a herd. Clinical Implications - In this example, we did not detect an association between productivity of cattle and exposure to sour natural gas. Several methods can be used for ranking potential exposure after discovery of a leak.

The dose rates of γ-radiation on the soil surface ranged from 0.0002 to 2 mGy/h. The frequency of reciprocal translocations in mouse spermatocytes was relatively low, but increased with the dose rate. Embryo mortality was increased only in the progeny of male mice in males caught in 1987 in the area with maximal contamination. The frequency of mice heterozygous for recessive lethal mutations decreased with time after the accident.

AB  - As has been shown by the authors of a paper recently published in this journal, a deviation from a long-term trend in perinatal mortality within the former Federal Republic of Germany occurred in 1987, i.e. 1 year following the Chernobyl disaster. It is the aim of this study to make a comparison between the areas of the state Bavaria, Germany, with different fallout levels as well as between the observed and expected numbers of perinatal deaths relating to these areas. The expected numbers of perinatal deaths, defined as external standard, were derived from the remainder of the former FRG. Testing an a priori formulated hypothesis revealed no differences in the temporal development of perinatal mortality between the areas with different fallout levels and subsequent exposures. Including May 1986 into the analysis revealed a significant increase during the first 3 months after the accident, which is due to an excess in May alone. Since no elevated radiation risks for the last days in utero are known, the additional Chernobyl radiation exposure is not plausible as a causative agent. Further analyses on stillbirths showed an increase in Southern Bavaria during the first 2 years following the accident. Later on, the rates were comparable to the expected values again.

AB  - A massive increase in the global prevalence of non-insulin dependent diabetes is likely to occur as 'Westernisation' of dietary habits and patterns of physical activity becomes more widespread. Advances in molecular and cellular science may provide some useful insights and therapeutic tools to assist in the fight against the severe consequences of this epidemic. These will include the better identification of specific aetiological subtypes of the disease; the identification of new drugs through the better understanding of the biology of insulin secretion and action; and the targeting of therapies to specific subtypes of the disease. In addition, knowledge of the precise mode of action and antidiabetes drugs may facilitate the design of more effective non-pharmacological manipulations; the genetic identification of 'high risk' asymptomatic people may allow us to target screening and preventive strategies more effectively; and investigations into the mechanisms that underlie the link between low birth weight and later diabetes should provide new routes towards treatment and prevention. Barriers to the implementation of the global measures required to stem the predicted flood of non-insulin dependent diabetes may prove insuperable, but if we are to have any success, then close collaboration between clinicians, epidemiologists, public health physicians, and laboratory scientists will be essential.

AB  - Perinatal mortality in Germany was investigated with respect to a possible relationship to the nuclear accident in Chernobyl on April 26, 1986. Using annual data of perinatal mortality, a trend analysis based on an appropriately chosen statistical model was performed which showed a significant increase in 1987. In addition, we calculated the cesium concentration in women's bodies using data of the cesium concentration in milk. We found two peaks of cesium concentration that were associated with the observed two peaks of monthly perinatal mortality data with a delay of 7 months.

AB  - According to Dr. Kebede Tadesse, Minister of Social and Administrative Affairs, as stated in a speech before the Consultative Group Meeting in Addis Ababa in December 1996, the health status of Ethiopia is one of the worst in the world because of "backward socio-economic development, poor environmental quality, high fertility rate, repeated natural and man-made disasters, and inadequate health services." An article in the April 11, 1997, Addis Tribune supports this claim by describing the horrific conditions found in a public hospital in Addis Ababa. Patients returned home to die because of the shortage of beds. Dr. Kebede gave the following statistics: the average daily per capita food intake is 1750 calories, 80% of that recommended; 5% of children show signs of wasting; 64% of children have stunted growth; 17% of pregnant and lactating women are anemic; the average national fertility rate is 6.1%; the percentage of AIDS cases per 100,000 people is 10.7; 18% of people have access to potable water; 14% of births are attended; 16% of people receive antenatal care; 40% of the population is immunized; 8% of the population receives family planning services; the infant mortality rate is 130/1000 live births; the maternal mortality rate is 500-700/100,000 live births; there is 1 physician per 33,333 Ethiopians; and the life expectancy at birth is 48 years. The article recommended the following "basic principles and guidelines" to improve the situation: 1) the population should be educated about good hygiene; 2) family planning should be popularized by the government; 3) the health budget should be increased to meet overall demand for health services and to target diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis; 4) private investment in health care is needed; 5) a safe drinking water supply must be made available; and 6) domestic conditions should be made favorable so that Ethiopian doctors educated abroad will return to practice in Ethiopia.

AB  - In many countries, women are poorly nourished and have a high rate of reproductive morbidity. However, during war and other disaster situations, women and children become even more vulnerable. Most of the world's refugees and internally displaced people are women and children. Many women refugees are malnourished and during the emergency and exodus phases, many are starving. Severe malnutrition in a pregnant woman causes fetal malnutrition. Infants born to a malnourished mother are of low birth weight and will grow up malnourished if they stay in the same deprived environment as their mothers. Households headed by women tend to obtain the least food and the children of such households tend to be poorly nourished. Many of the problems and obstacles women face during peacetime and non-emergency situations are simply exacerbated during disasters and war. It may not be possible to head off disasters which result in massive social upheaval, but preparations can nonetheless be made to mollify conditions once disaster hits. Responsible organizations and agencies should research the situation and plan for the worst. This paper discusses how women lose social and economic power during periods of armed conflict, the often lack of even basic reproductive health care during armed conflict and emergencies, coping in an emergency, and living in a refugee camp.

AU  - Bernstein, A.

AB  - Professor Bernstein considers a theme of Judge Weinstein's judicial and academic writings - that tort law works imperfectly to effect justice in mass disaster cases - through the vehicle of thalidomide, the paradigmatic toxic substance. Thirty-five years ago, thalidomide poisoned thousands of children, inflicting limb-reduction birth defects. Professor Bernstein argues that the drug has also had a malforming effect on mass tort law. Courts and scholars have used the precedent of thalidomide to build stringent legal standards of proof and causation, without enough attention to the functions and consistency of these standards. Thalidomide has also prompted commentators to celebrate American drug regulation and the American liability system; Professor Bernstein argues that these paeans are exaggerated. She concludes that the United States must confront its thalidomide history, as other nations in the world have done, and build social institutions - strong regulation and social insurance - to guard against toxic disasters of the future.

AB  - In the last decades of this century we are witnesses of frequent crises in different parts of the world produced by internal disturbance and wars. These crises, together with natural disasters, poverty and hunger, follow the history of mankind often forcing huge population groups to leave their homes. The harmful health consequences are among negative effects of migrations. While stable populations have well-tried routines for maintaining health, migrations mean abandoning such support systems. The increased exposure to harmful factors contributes more to the bad health condition of the migrant population. Setting of newcomers and local people together in the same homes, reduction in food and heating resources, drug shortage as well as importation of new infectious agents, may also endanger health of the native population. These observations have also been confirmed by Yugoslav experience. Depending on the fact whether a migration is elemental or organized i.e. dependent on its place in the large scale between these two extreme endpoints, the size of risk is also dependent on the consequences and degree of their difficulty. Mass health disturbances occur during migrations of the population from war regions, migrations from areas of natural disasters, mass pilgrimage, migrations of seasonal workers and migrations of armies during wars. However, even in these difficult times and conditions, a good organization can contribute to the mitigation of harmful consequences caused by these migrations. For instance, in 1942 there was an epidemic of typhus fever in Bosnia when many refugees crossed the Drina river on the way to Serbia escaping from Ustasha terrorism. At the Serbian side there were checkpoints where the refugees could taka a bath and where their laundry and clothing were depediculated with dry air, and after a two-week quarantine they could continue to Serbian provinces without making new foci of typhus fever. The most vulnerable and numerous group of refugees is usually composed of women, children and old persons. One of the largest migrations took place over the period from 1991 to 1995, when about 1,500,000 people left the war areas of the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. Of that number, about 700.000 refugees came to Yugoslavia. In August 1995 during an unprecedented exile from the Kninska krajina region (Croatia) over 200,000 people left their homes. During the arrival of refugees and expelled persons health teams offered first aid to these unlucky persons at reception points: drinking water, food, emergency care and indispensable clothing. The next step in their task was to move refugees into families i.e. into collective camps and centres. As in similar situations, this migration had also its negative effects on health of the refugees. At this time, however, the situation was aggravated by international economic sanctions imposed to Yugoslavia although Yugoslavia has accepted and received more refugees than all European countries together. In 1992 a special refugees Law was promulgated in Yugoslavia. In this Law, among other things, it was stated that "the organized reception, temporary lodging, nutrition, appropriate health care, material and other sort of help" will be secured to refugees. The increased infant mortality rate in Yugoslavia may be ascribed to migrations. After several years of decrease it was in constant rise over the period from 1991 to 1995 (Table 1). Disturbed mental balance, loosing of ethic norms, feeling of hopelessness and despair, and underestimation of the risk of infections among refugees, contributed to the rise of promiscuity and increase in sexually transmitted diseases. Thus, the number of registered cases of symphills in the period 1991-1995 was six times greater than in previous years. The number of gonorrhea cases was twice greater in this period than before that time. At the same time, it should be emphasized that the number of recorded cases was smaller than it w

AB  - Genetic effects were studied in house mice caught from 1986 to 1994 in regions polluted by radionuclides as a result of the Chernobyl disaster. The dose rates of gamma-radiation on the soil surface ranged from 0.02 to 200 mR/h. The frequency of reciprocal translocations in mouse spermatocytes was relatively low, but increased with the dose rate. Embryo mortality was increased only in the progeny of male mice caught in 1987 in the area with maximum contamination. The frequency of mice heterozygous for recessive lethal mutations decreased with the time after the accident.

AB  - We studied survival of radiocollared elk (Cervus elaphus) calves in Yellowstone National Park from 1987 to 1990, and survival of calves computed from population estimates from 1968 to 1992. We hypothesized that summer and winter survival of elk calves and mass of neonates were inversely related to population size, measures of environmental severity, and timing of births. Herd-wide survival estimates based on winter counts, reported harvests, and herd classifications, suggested that winter survival of elk calves was related inversely to estimated size of the elk population during winter (P = 0.0002), but we found no correlation with an index of winter severity (P = 0.51). Summer survival of elk calves also was correlated inversely with the estimated size of the elk population the previous winter (P = 0.03). Summer survival of radiocollared calves averaged 0.65 (n = 127 marked calves) from 1987 to 1990, the losses mostly due to predation (22%). Winter survival of calves averaged 0.72 (n = 88 marked calves entered the winter period), with losses due mostly to malnutrition (58%). Summer survival of radiocollared calves was positively correlated with estimated birth weight (P = 0001). Survival of radiocollared calves during winters 1987-90 was correlated positively with early calving and mildness of the winter (in contrast to herd-wide survival estimates), and was inversely correlated with estimated elk population size that winter (P = 0.006). Winter survival of radiocollared calves was lower during 1988-89 following the drought and large fires than the other 3 winters (P < 0.001). Predation on elk calves during summer doubled after the drought and fires of 1988 (13% calf tosses to predation before the fires vs. 29% after the fires). Potential compensation existed between components of calf mortality: predators killed more light (P = 0.041) and more late born calves (P = 0.146); calves were born later and lighter (P = 0.048) following severe weather conditions; and heavier born calves survived at a higher rate (P = 0.006). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that density-dependent mortality of calves during winter due to malnutrition, and summer mortality of calves due to predation were partially compensatory but severe environmental conditions produced largely additive components to both summer (increased predation) and winter (increased malnutrition) mortality.

AB  - Limited data from Turkey indicate that smoking presents a major threat to Turkish children. Parental, particularly maternal, smoking results in an increase in spontaneous abortion, low birth weight, congenital abnormalities, neonatal death and decreased physical and mental development in the infant, which can persist into adult life. Parental smoking results in increased rates of respiratory and middle ear illness in children, more so in infants and in older children more school absences. Naturally both of the effects are even greater if the children start to smoke themselves. Smoking parents are more likely to have smoking children, so that the cycle of illness repeats in future generations. Doctors have a major responsibility to save both present and future generations from this disaster. In this article appropriate action is outlined.

AB  - Food security is especially important for mothers with infants and young children. Poor mothers or mothers living in harsh conditions (refugee camp, war zone, economic embargo, or natural disaster) who were not encouraged to breast feed face each day the need to respond to their hungry children. Protection of optimal breast feeding practices is a top priority. There are about 50 million refugees and internally displaced people in the world. This number increases by 12% annually. Around 2 million of these people are new mothers. Urban centers in both the developed and developing countries have increasing populations of unemployed and working poor. These people cannot afford breast milk substitutes. North American food banks cannot respond to the many requests for infant formula. Lack of potable water and a dependency on unavailable infant formula and supplies partially contributed to the increase in infant mortality rates in the war zones of Iraq and Bosnia. The increased dependency of sourcing clean water, an inexpensive and inferior breast milk substitute, and fuel for preparation must not exacerbate the burden of food insecurity for new mothers. Lactating mothers need nutritional and social support so they can meet their own needs and those of their children. UN agencies, governments, and infant feeding organizations have developed guidelines to support breast feeding in emergency and relief conditions and to make sure that infant formula manufacturers do not target families in emergencies. The solution to food insecurity is to feed the mother so she can feed her child. Successful breast feeding helps the mother's self-esteem and confidence, which in turn helps her care for herself and her family. Challenges in infant feeding policies include effecting effective promotion, protection, and support of breast feeding in emergencies; reducing unnecessary risks to mothers and infants when there is a limited need for breast milk substitutes; and countering the apparent philanthropic act of breast milk substitute distribution of the infant feeding industry during emergencies.

AB  - Different refugee camps may have widely differing morbidity and mortality rates. Some of these differences are ascribed to environmental factors. This paper reviews the key issues relating to one environmental factor: the size of the refugee camp, and provides a tentative theoretical framework for examining the effect of camp size on refugees. This effect may not be considered because aid workers chronically underestimate the value of the refugees' contribution to their own survival. Large camps settle great numbers of refugees to the hinterland of the camp and limit their access to resources available there. This may increase refugee dependency and vulnerability. There is some slight evidence from the analysis of data provided by Mercer (1992) that child mortality rates (aged 0-4 years) are positively correlated with camp size (as inferred from child populations). If other factors allow, it might be wise for camp planners to try to limit camps to a size which allows refugees reasonable access to local resources.

AB  - Risk assessment is a process for identifying adverse consequences and their associated probability. As applied to impacts on human health from contaminant residuals in food, risk assessment involves four steps - (i) determination of exposure media (food) contaminant concentrations; (ii) exposure assessment; (iii) toxicity assessment; and (iv) risk characterization. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the risk assessment process and identify terminology and methods. In the area of public health protection, risk assessment has proven most useful when applied to endpoints with high negative value (or negative utility) -such as disasters and irreversible diseases such as cancer and birth defects. Less success has been attained when it is applied to reversible and/or threshold-type diseases such as muscle dysfunction and neurological effects. We will consider why this is and what this implies for the application of risk assessment to a broader range of human diseases and low likelihood impacts. An important issue in health risk assessment is how precisely we can characterize the distribution among individuals and/or species of potential effects and whether this level of precision favours one or another action.

AB  - To analyse the pre- and post-Gulf War changes in the outcome of pregnancy and to explore the possible causes that could have affected these changes, a retrospective analysis of medical records of patients delivering in Maternity Hospital Kuwait (MHK) was carried out for the period 1987-89 (pre-Gulf-War) and 1992 (post-Gulf War). The records of 1991 were used when adequate information was available. The normal z test was used to assess the significance between two proportions. There is a significant rise in abortion, low birth weight babies, triplet pregnancies, and major congenital anomalies in the post-war period. The still-birth rate, early neonatal mortality rate and perinatal mortality rate significantly increased in the immediate post-war period in 1991, but decreased to levels below the pre-war period in 1992. It should be investigated whether these changes are secondary to the changes in the population structure; the effects of war in terms of deterioration of health care services; environmental pollution caused by oil well fires, oil spills; or the psychological trauma, anxiety and stress caused by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

AB  - In two municipalities in Lower Saxony statistically valid clusters were observed, which attracted great public interest. Committees were set up to initiate a large variety of on-the-spot-investigations. Finally, it was decided to conduct a case control study throughout Lower Saxony to explore potential risk factors which might explain the observed clusters. A limited number of already established and currently discussed hypotheses was chosen for investigation. The study was based on patients registrated at the German Children's Cancer Registry (GCCR). For each child with leukemia diseased between 1988 and 1993 two population-based controls (local and state controls) and one tumour control were selected. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire self-administered by the parents and a telephone interview. In addition, measurements of electromagnetic fields and radon were performed and inspections of the child's birth record were made for the purpose of confirming a potential association between parenteral vitamin K prophylaxis and leukemia or tumours. This paper presents the concept and basic considerations of the study, its design and statistical evaluation. Response rates and a summary of results will be presented, too. The paper will serve as a reference for subsequent publications about more detailed analyses of specific potential risk factors. 425 parents of diseased children and 610 of non-diseased children were asked for participation. The rates of response were 82% for families with diseased and 71% for families with non-diseased children. In total, 781 parents participated in the study. The most important results are as follows: 1) The Greaves' hypothesis (9, 10) was supported by the following results: In children diseased with leukemia, vaccinations were less frequent, virus-related infections occurred more rarely, these children were more frequently first-born children and more frequently breastfed, and they possibly had fewer contacts with other children in infancy. 2) Our data do not show a significant association between parenteral vitamin K prophylaxis and leukemia or tumours (17). 3) Measurements of electromagnetic fields show a weak association between high-level exposure and an increased risk of developing leukemias. 4) Children who were X-rayed more than four times or were born prematurely and had received intensive care treatment show a positive association with occurrence of leukemia, but the number of these patients was very small and these factors are not independent. 5) The only potential job-related hazard was paternal exposure to plastic and resin fumes. 6) The incidence of miscarriages and abortions was increased in mothers of children with leukemia. 7) Our study did not confirm the hypotheses, that leukemia is associated with gestational age, with consumption of alcohol, nicotine, and medicaments during pregnancy. Nor was any association detected with exposure to wood preservatives and insecticides or with a high socio-economic status. 8) The number of patients living in municipalities with increased incidence of leukemia was too small to show statistically valid results. However, it is noteworthy that some of the above-mentioned risk factors were observed also in these children. One of the purposes of a nation-wide case control study which is currently performed at the GCCR is to validate and complete these results.

AB  - During the past 20 years, there has been a flood of papers in the medical literature examining the impact of perinatal loss and documenting dramatic changes in the medical management of this loss. Although Bourne and Lewis (1992) have provided an annotated bibliography of nearly 400 papers concerning stillbirth and neonatal death alone, barely a trickle has come from psychoanalytic quarters. Unspoken allegiance to some traditional psychoanalytic beliefs that are increasingly viewed as outdated may impede applying contemporary psychoanalytic frameworks to understand perinatal loss. Four tenets of psychoanalytic theory-the unborn child experienced as solely a fantasy, mother's symbolic equation of her child primarily with the penis, unconscious causation of perinatal loss, and the ubiquity of unconscious ambivalence underlying parental guilt-are all critically evaluated and revised to introduce a contemporary psychoanalytic understanding of perinatal loss. Because a multidimensional psychoanalytic model has been described in detail elsewhere (Leon, 1990, 1992b), it is not elaborated here.

AB  - Russia's public health problems, which are a result in part of uncontrolled development, are a lesson for developing countries. Trends in births and deaths in Russia indicate that as socioeconomic conditions declined in recent years, the death rate increased. During 1992-93 the death rate increased from 12.1 per 1000 population to 14.5, with 75% of the increase due to cardiovascular disease, accidents, murder, suicide, and alcohol poisoning. Quality of health care was given as one reason for the high cardiovascular disease rate that included deaths due to even mild heart attacks. 20-30% of deaths are attributed to pollution. 75% of rivers and lakes in the former Soviet Union are considered unfit for drinking, and 50% of tap water is unsanitary. An estimated 15% of Russia's land area is considered to be an ecological disaster zone. Births declined from a peak of 2.5 million in 1987 to 1.4 million in 1994. During this same period deaths increased from 1.5 million to 2.3 million. In 1994 deaths exceeded births by 880,000. Life expectancy declined from 65 to 57 years for men and from 75 years to 71 years for women. Infant mortality is rising. 11% of newborns had birth defects, and 60% showed evidence of allergies or vitamin D deficiencies. The death rate during pregnancy was 50 per 1000 births, and 75% of Russian women experienced complications during pregnancy. Women's health in the reproductive years was compromised by gynecological infections. A survey in 1992 revealed that 75% of Russian women gave insufficient income as a reason for reduced childbearing. The social conditions in Russia and the former Soviet republics reflect a lack of confidence in the future. Demographic trends are affected by a complex set of factors including economic collapse, economic change and uncertainty, inadequate health care, and poor environmental conditions. These changes occurred during the mid-1980s and before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

AB  - Non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, are increasingly instrumental to the implementation of international health programs. Following an overview of current conditions in global health and the problems that could be targeted by NGOs, this article describes the activities and philosophies of several representative approaches in this sector. The attributes of NGOs that increase their potential effectiveness are discussed, including ability to reach areas of severe need, promotion of local involvement, low cost of operations, adaptiveness and innovation, independence, and sustainability. A summary is provided of major future challenges in international health that may be addressed by NGOs, with particular emphasis on tobacco-related disease, communicable diseases and the AIDS epidemic, maternal mortality and women's health, injury prevention and control, and the need to secure durable financial support.; Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have provided humanitarian assistance (relief, disaster assistance, and food distribution) abroad for at least 100 years. Over the last two decades, they have also worked towards alleviating the causes of poverty and improving the quality of life. NGOs have attributes making them uniquely effective in providing international health services. They can reach areas of great need in both rural and urban areas, particularly helping the poor, the dispossessed, and the isolated. NGOs foster community participation. Since they tend to be committed for the long term, they form close bonds with community groups and institutions, resulting in strong support for their services. NGOs tend to operate at low cost due to mission-minded and committed staff working for a stipend or low wages, use of low cost technology, and streamlined services. They have the flexibility to be adaptive and innovative. NGOs usually are apolitical organizations that have a local nonpartisan status, engendering greater acceptance by government and the community. They strive for outcomes that are sustainable. They have been effective in setting up sustainable primary health care delivery systems. NGOs focus on a variety of areas. Some are dedicated to a single organ system (e.g., the eye, Orbis and Helen Keller International). Others focus on the prevention, treatment, or elimination of a single disease (e.g., guinea worm infection, President Carter's Global 2000 project). The primary mission of Project HOPE is health education, particularly training of health professionals in developing countries to become medical and health care faculty. The French NGO Medecins Sans Frontiere (MSF) focuses on human rights issues and determines interventions based on medical needs whether or not a local government accepts assistance or allows MSF teams to enter. Future challenges facing NGOs include the emerging pandemic of tobacco-related diseases, communicable diseases and the AIDS epidemic, maternal mortality and women's health, injury prevention and control, and sustained financing. NGOs do make a difference in global health.

AB  - As a result of the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, the district of Gomel in Belarus has become the most contaminated area within the former USSR. A comparative pilot study conducted by the authors to establish the mortality in that district during the 1984-1992 period has not yet revealed any elevated mortality among children aged 0 to < 15 years for the period after the accident. Diseases of the respiratory system and congenital anomalies were found to be the principal causes of death in this age group (ICD9: classes VIII and XIV). Owing to the low number of children born during the study period and the concomitant small number of deaths from neoplasms, a clear analysis of changes in the structure of mortality from neoplasms (ICD9: class II) has not yet been possible. The birth rate in the Gomel district where the highest radiation exposure was experienced has dropped: There was an obvious decrease during 1987, i.e. during the year which immediately followed that of the accident, to rise again in 1992 to levels comparable to those of other study areas.

AB  - Women and girls in the Sudan face considerable burdens. Maternal mortality is high (655/100,000 live births). Less than 50% of girls attend primary school. Only 20% attend secondary school. 88% of women cannot read or write. 8.8% of all women 15-19 years old have children. About 80% of the population live in rural areas. Droughts, floods, and plagues trouble the agriculture-based economy. Poverty burdens women at a rate two times that of men. Political unrest and civil war in the south have made widows of many women and orphans of many children. Girls work from a very early age. Women must work with their husbands in the fields or have an alternative source of income. Girls from a low-income family, who are the eldest daughters, or who have younger sisters and brothers must work to feed and clothe the family and to pay school fees. Many women go to Khartoum to find a better life, but few jobs exist, even if the women are well educated. Some women as young as 12 years old sell tea in the street, work as maids for the privileged, or work as sex workers. Some women form groups with an older woman serving as their leader. She promises to protect the women in her group from hunger. Yet, she cannot defend them against HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases. Any woman arrested for soliciting clients may serve 2-3 months in prison. The government has a program for women prisoners informing them about HIV/AIDS and providing them new skills. The IEC (information, education, and communication) coordinator for HIV/AIDS in the Ministry of Health has set up this special program which provides religious advice and handicrafts. The program also shows women prisoners videos on transmission and prevention of HIV/AIDS.

AB  - The complication of diabetes during pregnancy can be a disaster for both mother and child. However, proper management of diabetes prior to conception and during pregnancy has enabled diabetics to have normal infants nearly as often as non-diabetic women. This article reviews the historical aspects of gestational diabetes, the magnitude of the problem, carbohydrate metabolism during pregnancy, appropriate therapy, and offers some suggestions about how gestational diabetes and non-insulin dependent diabetes might be prevented.

AB  - More than 5500 people were killed in the Hanshin‐Awaji earthquake disaster. Most of the neonatal intensive care units (NICU) could not offer proper services as a result of the earthquake and the Hyogo Emergency System for Neonates could not function. No one imagined that such a great disaster would occur in their home town, Kobe; however, the devastation of the quake has raised the opportunity to examine the operation of neonatal medicine in an emergency. We sent out questionnaires to perinatologists in the damaged area 2–3 months after the quake. Some hospitals in the demolished area suffered such serious damage that they could not continue work as NICU, and some in the surrounding area had problems in a number of areas, including staff, room capacity and transport methods. Under these difficult circumstances the greatest problem encountered by staff was maintaining fundamental care in NICU, that is to say keeping temperature, formula (nutrition) and prevention of infection techniques operating. In this report we discuss the effects on neonatal medicine of the earthquake in Kobe. Medical staff struggled patiently and made great efforts to recover and maintain the functioning of NICU. We believe this information will be useful for neonatology staff in other areas which may experience an earthquake in the future. 1995 Japan Pediatric Society

AB  - The narrative 1 Kgs 18 of Elijah’s battle on M. Carmel with the Baalpriests can be viewed as yet another OT story of the appointment of the scapegoat. Using R. Girard’s methodology it appears that the Baalpriests are held responsible for the drought, and are slaughtered as a kind of sacrifice. Hereby the rain is caused to return, ending the collective crisis. At second sight, though, the Baalpriest appear to be scapegoats for the one person responsible, Queen Jezebel, who at first introduced the Tyrean Baal in Israel, and who is, for example, the one to inaugurate the miscarriage of justice in the case of Naboth’s Vineyard. At the same time there are tendencies in the Ahab cycle to portray the king as less guilty than he is judged usually; and there are traits that resemble the narratives of other, more positive kings in the Deuteronomistic History, Ahaz, Zedekiah, and Josiah. © 1995 Scandinavian University Press.

AB  - The Central Asian states of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, formerly members of the Soviet Union, are all near to, or form a coast of, the Aral Sea. Intensive over-usage of water plus intensive pesticide and defoliant usage has created an ecological disaster of immense proportions in the area. Twenty-five years ago this was the fourth largest inland sea in the world. Its volume has now decreased by 75%, and its salinity has tripled. But the effects on the sea itself pale in comparison with the ecological and human impact on the whole of Central Asia. The documented health consequences include high rates of cancer, stillbirth and genetic abnormalities, impaired immune function, chronic gastritis and cardiovascular disease. © 1995, Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - As part of our work on the influence of water source on reproductive outcome, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to tap water, bottled water, or deionized water treatment groups, utilizing 160 animals per treatment; animals received the water prior to and during pregnancy. Rats were shipped in four batches (A-D). Batch effects were seen for several reproductive parameters. Because the tap water supply was interrupted by an earthquake resulting in an unbalanced design, primary analyses utilized only batches C and D, which included most of the tap water-treated rats. A treatment effect with respect to resorption frequency was seen that was marginally significant using a fixed-effects analysis of variance (P = 0.053), but not when batch was entered as a random effect (P = 0.36). The data were modeled by logistic regression, controlling for batch, litter size, and batch-treatment interaction. The odds ratio comparing tap to bottled water was 1.8 (95% CI 1.0 to 3.3, P = 0.05), which was similar to the epidemiologic result that prompted this study. The magnitude of this association varied by batch, and the difference in resorption frequency was within the range of variation seen for control animals. Although these findings do not justify public health action at this time, further investigation is warranted. © 1995.

AB  - An ecological disaster besets the central Asian republic of Kazakhstan. The Aral Sea has shrunk so much, due to removal of its water for massive irrigation projects, that it may even disappear soon. The soils of the coastal zone have been degraded and denuded. Radiation activity from nuclear tests and chemical fertilizers pose a major health hazard. The poor economy and declining social services exacerbate Kazakhstan's problems. The new Republic of Kazakhstan has passed legislation that denotes the state and society as protectors of family, maternity, paternity, and childhood. Women comprise 62% of specialists with higher and secondary specialized education. Their critical contribution to the national economy merits policies to protect the social, economic, and health status of women. The quality of their reproductive health connects them with their social and economic status. Kazakhstan's relatively high maternal mortality rate has fallen over the last four years. Complications of pregnancy and labor as well as during the postpartum period account for most causes of maternal death. The percentage of maternal deaths from such complications has declined from 40% to 31.1% between 1991 and 1993. In fact, the percentage of maternal deaths from other causes has also decreased. The general state of women's health, reproductive function, and the quality of health services are interdependent factors influencing maternal mortality. The main determinants of maternal mortality are maternal age and parity, especially when the birth interval is less than two years. Unwanted pregnancies contribute greatly to maternal mortality. Health officials consider family planning to be a means to prevent and reduce abortions. They use the mass media to inform the public about family planning and the reproductive system. They promote breast feeding.

AB  - Introduction: Prehospital providers regularly encounter patients with obstetrical emergencies. This study determined the frequency and outcome of out-of-hospital deliveries in an urban, all advanced life support (ALS) emergency medical services (EMS) system. Methods: Retrospective review of all out-of-hospital records that involved women delivering babies in the care of prehospital providers from 1984–1988. The EMS system answered an average of 62, 000 calls during the study period. The records of these patients were identified through a computer database. Results: A total of 81 out-of-hospital deliveries (1.4/month) occurred during the study years. The average age of the mothers was 24 years, and the average gestation period was 30 weeks. The women had an average of three previous pregnancies and two previous deliveries, and 10 were primagravida. Seventy-two (89%) of the deliveries occurred in the home. The paramedics encountered a variety of obstetrical and neonatal complications in 34% of the patient encounters. Nine neonates were delivered prior to the arrival of the paramedic team. Twenty-four neonates had Apgar scores calculated, and the one- and five-minute scores averaged eight and nine respectively. Five of the mothers had no prenatal care. Maternal complications included four patients noted to be hypertensive with the delivery, nine patients had some degree of vaginal bleeding, and in 33 patients, the prehospital providers did not deliver the placenta in the field. An EMS physician was in attendance for only two of the out-of-hospital deliveries. Discussion: in this urban EMS system, out-of-hospital deliveries, especially pre-term deliveries, are a common event. There appears to be a significant number of neonatal complications that confront paramedics. Generally, the paramedics were deficient in their documentation of the neonatal assessment. Continuing educational programs for paramedics should include reviewing normal and complicated vaginal deliveries as well as ALS measures for neonates. Protocols for obstetrical emergencies need to be developed and subjected to quality improvement measures. Conclusions: Paramedics, especially those in urban settings, are likely to encounter obstetrical and neonatal emergencies and a significant number of associated complications. Emergency medical services systems and medical directors should have in place continuing educational programs, patient-care protocols, and continuous quality improvement measures to evaluate the care rendered to patients having out-of hospital deliveries.

AB  - Hypothesis: Pediatric mortality is predicted by age, presence of head trauma, head trauma with a low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, a low Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS), and transport directly to a pediatric trauma center. Population: Studied were 1, 429 patients younger than 16 years old admitted to or declared dead on arrival (DOA) in a pediatric trauma center from January through October, 1988. The trauma system, which served 3-miUion persons, included six pediatric trauma centers. Methods: Data were obtained by a retrospective review of summary statistics provided to the Chicago Department of Health by the pediatric trauma centers. Results: Overall mortality was 4.8% (68 of 1429); 32 of the patients who died (47.1%) were DOA. The in-hospital mortality rate was 2.6%. Head injury was the principal diagnosis in 46.2% of admissions and was a factor in 72.2% of hospital deaths. The mortality rate was 20.3% in children with a GCS <10 and 0.4% when the GCS was >10 (odds ratio [ORj = 67.0, 95% Cl = 15.0-417.4). Wien the PTS was <5, mortality was 25.6%; with a PTS >5, the mortality was 0.2% (OR = 420.1, 95% Cl = 99.3-2, 520). Although transfers to a pediatric trauma center accounted for 73.6% of admissions, direct field triage to a pediatric trauma center was associated with a 3.2 times greater mortality risk (95% Cl = 1.58-6.59). Mortality rates were equal for all age groups. Pediatric trauma center volume did not influence mortality rates. Conclusions: Head injury and death occur in all age groups, suggesting the need for broad prevention strategies. Specific GCS and PTS values that predict mortality can be used in emergency medical services (EMS) triage protocols. Although the high proportion of transfers mandates systemwide transfer protocols, the lower mortality in these patients suggests appropriate EMS field triage. These factors should be considered as states develop pediatric trauma systems. Prehospital and Disaster Medicine 1995;10(1):19-23. © 1995, World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine.

AB  - Background: Crush injury is the result of prolonged pressure to the limbs when individuals are trapped under the debris of earthquakes, bombings, and other disasters. Muscle integrity is compromised, and the local and systemic manifestations, including rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation may be fatal. Case: A 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, was trapped under fallen masonry at 6 weeks' gestation for approximately 6 hours. On initial examination, she showed early signs of hypovolemic shock and crush injury, including hyperkalemia. Prompt management with fluid therapy and careful monitoring led to a rapid recovery. Antenatal follow-up was routine and concluded in spontaneous delivery of a healthy infant. Conclusion: The unique physiology of the pregnant woman may affect the outcome of crush injury, and it presents a particular challenge to the trauma team. The obstetrician should be aware of its dangers and should be an active participant in the prompt management of pregnant victims of crush injury to ensure a satisfactory outcome for both mother and fetus. © 1995 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - The U.S. Department of the Interior has investigated 25 areas in the western USA to determine whether irrigation drainage has caused harmful effects on wildlife or has reduced subsequent beneficial uses of the water. A database of chemical analyses of water, sediment, and biota from the 25 areas was created and supplemented with geologic, climatologic, and hydrologic date. The data were evaluated to identify common features among study areas and principal factors that result in Se contamination of water in lakes, ponds, and streams downgradient of irrigated areas. From the analysis of data, a decision tree that use readily available geologic, climatologic, and hydrologic date was derived for use by resource managers as a screening tool to predict the likelihood that irrigation drainage will result in Se contamination in areas of the western USA. Irrigation in areas that are not associated with marine sedimentary rocks of late Cretaceous age is unlikely to cause Se contamination. Irrigation in very arid areas that are associated with these Cretaceous sediments is almost certain to cause Se contamination if the irrigation water drains to terminal lakes and ponds. The likelihood that an area will be contaminated with Se because of irrigation drainage can change, particularly with changes in precipitation. During normal or wet periods, Se contamination may not occur in an area, even though it has seleniferous soils, but reduced water deliveries during a drought in such an area may result in Se contamination.

AB  - The past several years have been difficult for the Cuban people. The economies of Cuba’s major trading partners have collapsed. The U.S. government has increased its attempts to isolate Cuba economically. The March 1993 “Storm of the Century,” which devastated communities from the Caribbean to Canada, caused an estimated $1 billion in damage to Cuba. A mysterious disease known as neuropathy, which can affect vision, appeared in late 1991 and has spread throughout the island. All this has created a situation of scarcity and uncertainty that has affected all aspects of Cuban society, including its health care system. © 1994 Journal of Public Health Policy, Inc.

AB  - Around 1750 society grows aware of the high mortality of abandoned infants: enlightened physicians and administrators attempt to remedy this disaster and put the blame on the country wet nurses who took in the foundlings. A large number of contemporary historians have incritically contented themselves with repeating these reproaches. This article constitutes an attempt to rehabilitate country wet nurses. According to the authors, the infants were victims of the circumstances of being abandoned. An analysis based on a list of names does show that the most obvious causes for the high mortality rate of the foundlings were the close incidents surrounding the fact of being abandoned whereas it can rarely be explained by the living conditions at a wet nurse's. In the background, an original rural society emerges in a poor country taking in infants constitutes a real business. This study represents but one stage at the core of a developing research.

AB  - Disability rates among low‐birthweight infants, particularly those related to congenital abnormality and cerebral palsy, are high. Both prenatal and perinatal factors are likely to be involved in the aetiology of most types of disability. IQ tends to be lower among low‐birthweight infants, but does not appear to be closely related to birthweight alone. The confounding effect of social class should be considered when assessing aetiology and outcome. The long‐term outcome for the increasing number of low‐birthweight infants who survive and receive intensive neonatal care requires to be continually assessed; however, studies should not be confined to the very‐ and extremely‐low‐birthweight infant requiring prolonged intensive care, but should include abortions, stillbirths and neonatal deaths. As disability in survivors can relate to preterm birth but not perinatal complications, all low‐birthweight infants require to be studied if selective bias is to be solved. Étude du devenir sur 10 ans des accidents de grossesse Les taux d'incapacités chez les nourrissons de faible poids de naissance, particulièrement pour celles qui sont liées à une malformation congénitale ou une IMC, sont élevés. Des facteurs à la fois prénataux et périnataux sont probablement impliqués dans l'étiologie de la plupart des incapacityés. Le QI tend àêtre plus bas chez les nourrissons de faible poids de naissance, mais cela ne semble pas lie uniquement au poids de naissance. Les effets surajoutes de classe sociale doivent être pris en compte lorsque l'étiologie et le devenir sont analysés. Le devenir à long terme d'un nombre croissant de nourrissons de faible poids de naissance qui survivent et bénéficient de soins intensifs péri‐nataux doivent être continuellement évalués; cependant les études ne devraient pas se restreindre aux nourrissons de très faible et extrêmement faible poids de naissance ayant exigé des soins intensifs prolongés mais devraient inclure les avortement, les morts‐nés et les décès péri‐nataux. Comme l'incapacité chez les survivants peut être reliée à la naissance prématurée et non aux complications périnatales, tous les nourrissons de faible poids de naissance doivent être pris en compte si on vent éviter un biais par sélection de cas. Eine 10‐Jahres Studie uber rezidivierende Schwangerschaftsprobleme Die Behinderungsraten bei Kindern mit niedrigen Geburtsgewicht, besonders solche, die auf congenitalen Anomalien und Cerebralparese beruhen, sind hoch. Sowohl pränatale, als auch perinatale Faktoren spielen wahrscheinlich für die Aetiologie der meisten Behinderungsarten eine Rolle. Der IQ ist bei hypotrophen Kindern eher niedriger, scheint aber nicht nur mit dem Geburtsgewicht zusammenzuhängen. Der Einfluß der sozialen Schicht sollte bei der Beurteilung von Aetiologie und Outcome berücksichtigt werden. Der Langzeit Outcome für die zunehmende Zahl der hypotrophen Kinder, die überleben und intensivmedizinisch versorgt werden, erfordert eine kontinuierliche Überwachung; jedoch sollten die Untersuchungen nicht auf die Kinder mit sehr bzw. extrem niedrigem Geburtsgewicht, die eine verlängerte intensivmedizinische Betreuung brauchen, beschränkt bleiben, sondern sollten auch Fehlgeburten, Totgeburten und Todesfälle im Neugeborenenalter miteinschließen. Da eine Behinderung bei Überlebenden auf einer Frühgeburt ohne perinatale Komplikationen beruhen kann, müssen alle Kinder mit niedrigem Geburtsgewicht untersucht werden, um nichts zu übersehen. Un estudio de 10 años del conlinuo de mortalidad reproductiva Los porcentajes de minusvalencia en lactantes con bajo peso al nacer y, en especial, los relacionados con anomalías congénitas y parálisis cerebral, son altos. Tanto los factores pre‐ como perinatalcs estan igualmente involucrados en la etiologia de la mayor parte de incapacidades. El CI tiende a ser más bajo en los lactantes con bajo peso al nacer, pcro no parece que ello esté en relación únicamente con el bajo peso al nacer. El efecto confundidor de la clase social debe ser tornado en consideración al evaluar la etiologia y el curso evolutivo. El curso a largo plazo del número creciente de lactantes con bajo peso al nacer, que sobreviven y reciben un cuidado neonatal intensivo, requiere ser evaluado de forma continua. Sin embargo los estudios no deben ser limitados a los niños con muy bajo y bajissimo peso al nacer, que requieren un cuidado intensivo prolongado, sino que deben incluirse también los casos de aborto, muertos al nacer y nacidos muertos. Dado que la incapacidad en los supervivientes puede estar en relación con un parto a pretérmino, pero sin complicaciones perinatales, es necesario que todos los nacidos con bajo peso al nacer sean estudiados si se quiere resolber el sesgo selectivo.

AB  - Ill-health has been reported by many soldiers and others deployed in the Persian Gulf during the Gulf War of 1991. Iraqi children have also been reported as suffering from an undiagnosed wasting disease. Little conclusive information has come to light; this paper reviews what is known at present, largely from anecdotal reports. Symptoms reported differ from post-traumatic stress syndrome as reported after previous conflicts; some are suggestive of a direct effect on the immune system. Various possible causes are examined, including post-traumatic stress disorder, infection, prophylactic medication, exposure to chemical and biological warfare agents, exposures resulting from oil spills and fires, and exposure to depleted uranium ammunition. The latter was used extensively for the first time in the Gulf War, and is manufactured and test-fired in Britain. The passive role of the British government in following up such reports is noted, in contrast with the more active official responses in the United States. It is suggested that Desert Storm Syndrome is one example of multiple assault upon the body's immune system. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although one of the smallest of the new independent states of the former Soviet Union, the Republic of Armenia has an ancient tradition and a strong ethnic identification, greatly enhanced by the diaspora. In addition to the problems following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Armenia has had to contend with a draining war in Nagorno-Karabakh and the after-effects of a devastating earthquake in 1988. Humanitarian efforts have ranged from emergency supply deliveries to longer-term sustainable health care partnerships. The United States government, through the Agency for International Development, has organized such partnerships, partially as a result of a multinational mission in 1992 and a subsequent hospital-to- hospital program developed by the American International Health Alliance. We describe the current state of health care in Armenia and some of the problems that need to be addressed to improve health care services to its citizens.

AB  - Increasing rates of infant mortality and child diseases in the Upper Silesian Industry Region are indices of the declared ecological disaster. The concentrations of 11 ecotoxins established in air and soil is related to the infant mortality rate, according to the degree of pollution. The percentage of infants with birthweight below 2500 g is the highest in the most polluted towns, such as Chorzów, Zabrze, Bytom. The dominating causes of infant mortality in Zabrze were infections and congenital anomalies among babies born with significantly lower birthweight. The parents of dead children have been resident for at least 15 years. In Katowice district (south-western area of Poland) there is an increasing frequency of chronic respiratory, cardiovascular, oncological and allergic diseases among children. © 1994.

EP  - 128
AB  - This paper reviews present knowledge on the etiology, pathophysiology, complications, prevention, and therapy of the disorders induced by iodine deficiency. The recommended dietary allowances of iodine are 100 μg/day for adults and adolescents, 60-100 μg/day for children aged 1 to 10 years, and 35-40 μg/day in infants aged less than 1 year. When the physiological requirements of iodine are not met in a given population, a series of functional and developmental abnormalities occur including thyroid function abnormalities and, when iodine deficiency is severe, endemic goiter and cretinism, endemic mental retardation, decreased fertility rate, increased perinatal death, and infant mortality. These complications, which constitute a hindrance to the development of the affected populations, are grouped under the general heading of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). At least one billion people are at risk of IDD. Iodine deficiency, therefore, constitutes one of the most common preventable causes of mental deficiency in the world today. Most of the affected populations live in montainous areas in preindustrialized countries, but 50 to 100 million people are still at risk in Europe. The most important target groups to the effects of iodine deficiency from a public health point of view are pregnant mothers, fetuses, neonates, and young infants because the main complication of IDD, i.e., brain damage resulting in irreversible mental retardation, is the consequence of thyroid failure occurring during pregnancy, fetal, and early postnatal life. The main cause of endemic goiter and cretinism is an insufficient dietary supply of iodine. The additional role of naturally occurring goitrogens has been documented in the case of certain foods (milk, cassava, millet, nuts) and bacterial and chemical water pollutants. The mechanism by which the thyroid gland adapts to an insufficient iodine supply is to increase the trapping of iodide as well as the subsequent steps of the intrathyroidal metabolism of iodine leading to preferential synthesis and secretion of triiodotyronine (T<inf>3</inf>). They are triggered and maintained by increased secretion of TSH, which is ultimately responsible for the development of goiter. The acceleration of the main steps of iodine kinetics and the degree of hyperstimulation by TSH are much more marked in the pediatric age groups, including neonates, than in adults, and the development of goiter appears as an unfavorable side effect in the process of adaptation to iodine deficiency during growth. The most serious complication of iodine deficiency is endemic cretinism, a syndrome characterized by irreversible mental retardation together with either a predominant neurological syndrome or predominant hypothyroidism, or a combination of both syndromes. The prophylactic action of iodine on the incidence of both types of cretinism demonstrates the fundamental etiological role of iodine deficiency. The possible additional roles of thyroid growth-blocking immunoglobulins and of selenium deficiency have been suggested. The pathogenic roles of maternal and fetal hypothyroidism or a combination of both as well as of hypothyroidism present during the postnatal period are clearly established, but the relative importance of the three mechanisms in the pathogenesis of the various clinical manifestations of endemic cretinism is not entirely clearly established. A particularly important issue established both in severe and moderate conditions of iodine deficiency is that obvious neurointellectual deficits due to the deficiency are also frequently observed in individuals who do not present any of the other signs of endemic cretinism. The status of iodine nutrition was recently reevaluated in all European countries, including those in the Eastern part of the continent. Iodine deficiency is presently under control in only 5 countries (Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland). All other countries are still affected to varying degrees, especially in the southern and central parts of the continent. The public health consequences of iodine deficiency in Europe are an elevated thyroidal uptake of radioiodine that aggravates the risk of thyroid cancer in case of a nuclear accident, the occasional presence of neurointellectual deficits in schoolchildren, elevated frequencies of transient primary hypothyroidism and of transient hyperthyrotropinemia in young infants. Neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism using serum TSH as primary screening test appears as a particularly sensitive index of the effects of iodine deficiency at a population level and as a monitoring tool in the evaluation of the effects of iodine prophylaxis. Although theoretically entirely preventable, IDD still prevail in the world because of various socioeconomical, cultural, and political limitations to adequate programs of iodine supplementation, especially in Europe.

AB  - The primary causes of mortality in the United States are noninfectious diseases and conditions. Epidemiologic and intervention activities related to most of these diseases and conditions have increased in most State health agencies over the past decade. Because little was known of the practice of noninfectious disease epidemiology in State health agencies, a mail survey was undertaken in 1991. Persons working in State health agencies who responded to the survey had a graduate degree in epidemiology, biostatistics, or related fields and actively participated in the epidemiology of noninfectious diseases or conditions. Respondents were from 48 States, predominantly male (56 percent) and white (92 percent). On an average, respondents spent roughly half of their time actually doing epidemiology. The focus of noninfectious disease epidemiology has been categorized by risk factors (environment, occupation, nutrition, tobacco, and substance abuse), diseases (diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease), and health conditions (injury, birth defects, and other reproductive conditions). The percentage of respondents who reported epidemiologic activity in any risk factor, disease, or condition varied from 55 percent for environmental epidemiology to 9 percent in nutritional epidemiology. Respondents from 41 States reported activity in environmental epidemiology, those from 18 States reported activity in substance-abuse epidemiology, and those from 13 States reported activity in nutritional epidemiology. Although the practice of noninfectious disease epidemiology appears to be considered important in the majority of States, the extent of practice varies markedly. Those risk factors, diseases, and conditions that are most frequently associated with morbidity and mortality are the least addressed epidemiologically in State health agencies. In addition, when events such as environmental disasters occur, appropriate surveillance systems frequently are not in place to monitor the most important health outcomes. As a result, public health planning and intervention programs may not be driven by solid epidemiologic data.

AB  - The great hope and promise of post-independence efforts to promote equitable health care in Zimbabwe started with three years of dramatic improvement. Commitment to correcting inequities which were as discriminatory as any country in the world produced rapid extension of health centre infrastructure and the improvement of district hospitals. The major constraint was the entrenched pattern of sophisticated, high-technology health care left by colonial administrators which continued to monopolize resources. In spite of the excellent beginning, development of services for the poor was thwarted by recession, prolonged drought and external military destabilization. The cutbacks in funding for health care have been particularly severe as a result of economic adjustment policies imposed by IMF. Political pressure moved the health system toward private entrepreneurship returning to earlier patterns of discrimination in favour of whites and urban residents. Efforts to promote high-risk monitoring have had little impact among the poor and those living in remote areas. Equity has become symbolic rather than real. The government of Zimbabwe maintains a continuing commitment to the original goals of equity through primary health care. International agencies also would like to find a way to help reallocate services. There seems to be recognition that little will be accomplished in improving health conditions unless services are provided to those in greatest need. Disparities in maternal care are especially severe and can be improved only by building infrastructure to provide antenatal and perinatal services. The timing seems right to try surveillance for equity as a means of using limited resources to reach the most needy mothers with targeted services. A system is proposed involving periodic surveys to identify groups among whom maternal care problems are concentrated and to tailor actions to the major causes of maternal mortality and morbidity. It would also establish a process of finding locally appropriate adaptations of cost-effective and sustainable solutions. The highest-priority interventions would be defined and implemented locally by strengthening the primary health care infrastructure and community participation. Health systems research in demonstration areas could lead to national extension.; Zimbabwe adopted the goal of equity in health care. A range of options for monitoring progress toward equity is available. Surveillance systems for monitoring equity characteristically are population-based. Population-based information can be used to identify priority subgroups, corrective action, and appropriate research questions. Equality of access and other social and health factors can be used to measure equity. Surveillance should stimulate community action. Self-financing health systems are appropriate only for those who can afford it. Public acceptance of equity requires social changes in attitudes. Cooperative relations between health services and local academic centers can contribute to local problem solving. Implementing a surveillance system for equity involves first conducting a Situation Analysis and setting priorities. Priority should be on carefully selected indicators. A list of biomedical, socioeconomic, and service indicators was provided. After independence in Zimbabwe some improvement was made in maternal mortality, infant mortality, and malnutrition. After independence, primary health care was promoted, but severe economic problems and the structural adjustment policies resulted in severe cuts to the social services. By 1987 there were 274 rural health centers, but funding was still lopsided in favor of curative care. Health center deliveries increased, but after a fee increase in 1988, there were declines. There was a shift to private medical care in urban areas. Inequities in health manpower were corrected by training health workers and reorienting the emphasis to prevention and health promotion. The number of deliveries with trained medical personnel and deliveries in health facilities increased by 1988. Immunization increased, albeit unevenly in poorer areas. Services for the poor were thwarted by recession, prolonged drought, and external military destabilization. Equity is only a symbol, unless a surveillance system can be established as a means of using limited resources to reach the most in need with targeted services.

AB  - Famine and civil war have resulted in high mortality rates and large population displacements in Somalia. To assess mortality rates and risk factors for mortality, we carried out surveys in the central Somali towns of Afgoi and Baidoa in November and December, 1992. In Baidoa we surveyed displaced persons living in camps; the average daily crude mortality rate was 16·8 (95% Cl 14·6-19·1) per 10 000 population during the 232 days before the survey. An estimated 74% of children under 5 years living in displaced persons camps died during this period. In Afgoi, where both displaced and resident populations were surveyed, the crude mortality rate was 4·7 (3·9-5·5) deaths per 10 000 per day. Although mortality rates for all displaced persons were high, people living in temporary camps were at highest risk of death. As in other famine-related disasters, preventable infectious diseases such as measles and diarrhoea were the primary causes of death in both towns. These mortality rates are among the highest documented for a civilian population over a long period. Community-based public health interventions to prevent and control common infectious diseses are needed to reduce these exceptionally high mortality rates in Somalia. © 1993.

AB  - This pamphlet lists some basic features of the 1993-98 Philippine Medium-Term Development Plan (goals, targets, strategies, and human resource development). The last page contains a table of human development indicators with the annual average for 1987-91 and annual targets during 1993-98. Statistical measures include specific indicators for health, nutrition, family planning, education, housing, and social welfare. The introduction urges all government units, nongovernmental organizations, and international donors to support the development plan in a united effort. The goals of the plan include enabling most of the population to meet basic minimum needs, providing a level of basic services to the more disadvantaged, and moving the productive capacity of human resources to a more competitive international arena. The expected accomplishments for 1998 include an increase in life expectancy to 67.0 years, a decrease in infant mortality to 49.4 per 1000 live births, a decline in the crude death rate to 6.3 per 1000 population, a decline in underweight children to 8.4%, an increase in per capita energy intake to 1977 kilocalories, an increase in the proportion of households with 100% adequate energy intake to 47.1%, an increase in literacy to 98%, higher school enrollments, an increase of housing units to satisfy 34% of the total housing need, and a large increase in the number of poor families receiving basic welfare services to 89%. Specific measures will be adopted to alleviate poverty and to promote equity. Social services will be targeted to the most vulnerable groups. Social safety nets for disaster or emergency relief will be developed and maintained. Public resources will be directed to the most disadvantaged regions, and support will be given for community housing efforts and use of traditional medicines and other indigenous resources. The homeless will receive social services for security of housing and welfare, and efforts will be made to reduce the number of displaced families.

AB  - Infant morbidity and mortality in the Upper Silesian Industrial Region (USIR) are indices of ecological disaster. In the most polluted region of such towns as Bytom, Chorzów and Zabrze, the infant mortality rate is very high and increasing. Indices of infant morbidity were higher in Katowice district than in the rest of Poland. Low birth weight (below 2,500 g) depends on the degree of pollution and influences the infant mortality rate. Most parents of children who died in the first year of life have been resident for at least 15 years. In Zabrze in recent years the percentage of congenital defects as the main cause of infant mortality is increasing.

AB  - In the UK 142 royal commissions have been appointed this century. The topics studied have a bias towards crime, medicine and the acquisition of money. The royal commissions on population, capital punishment, medical education, and mental illness are highlighted. The two most recent royal commissions have both considered the criminal justice system. The Philips Commission on criminal procedure spawned the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. This was followed by a long Tory royal commission drought, broken in response to a series of serious miscarriages of justice, brought to light after people wrongly convicted had served many years of imprisonment. The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice (RCCJ) has reported after 2 years' work with a list of 352 recommendations. Its proposals had an initial bad press, one proposal on rationalising the inefficient and misused system for choosing the mode of trial in 'either-way' cases being heralded as a negation of rights given to the English under Magna Carta! Less controversial proposals include setting up a new independent review authority to consider allegations of miscarriages of justice, improvements in the way scientific evidence is handled and presented to the court, and detailed pretrial procedures for serious and/or controversial cases. The RCCJ also commissioned 22 research reports which have had a considerable impact on the poorly funded discipline of criminology. It is concluded that, in spite of powerful iconoclastic views, royal commissions are cheap at the price.

AB  - The secretariat of the Economic Commission for Africa monitored and assessed the goals for attainment of the Health for All (HFA) by the year 2000. In the majority of African countries life expectancy ranges between 45 and 55 years. Infant and child mortality rates are over 80 per 1000 population. The countries with high mortality levels were expected by the year 2000 to attain life expectancy at birth of 60 or more years and reduce infant mortality to less than 50 per 1000 live births and child mortality to less than 70 per 1000 population. This initial study covered Lesotho, Swaziland, Botswana, Kenya, and Tanzania in order to monitor the implementation of attaining the preset targets of mortality reduction. In the analysis the interrelationships were defined by the HFA variables; by the intervening variables like government policies of health and population; and by the demographic factors such as the preset targets for mortality reduction. Some limitations of analysis had to do with the difficulties of data connection constraining the demographic research on health. The Ministries of Health in nearly all countries had problems of adequate financing. For example, less than 3% of GNP was available for health expenditure in 5 of the countries included in the study. The political instability of governments and their inability to sustain socioeconomic development also mattered. The drought and expanding populations in most countries have contributed to changes in disease prevalence and incidence. Diseases associated with poverty like malaria, diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, congenital anomalies, and complications of childbirth are changing the disease pattern in the region. The resistance of malaria to chloroquine and the spread of HIV/AIDS complications present enormous challenges to health promotion in the region. Botswana, Kenya, and Lesotho should be able to achieve the goals of HFA. The study further recommends full implementation of primary health care in order to attain the goals.

AB  - Reproductive ecology is defined as 'the study of causes and mechanisms of the effects of environmental risk factors on reproductive health and the methods of their prevention and management'. Major areas of concern, within the purview of this paper; relate to adverse pregnancy outcomes, effects on target tissues in the male and the female, and alterations in the control and regulatory mechanisms of reproductive processes. Teratogenic potential of chemicals, released as a result of accidents and catastrophes, is of critical significance. Congenital Minamata disease is due to transplacental fetal toxicity caused by accidental ingestion of methyl mercury. Generalized disorders of ectodermal tissue following prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls have been reported in Taiwan and Japan. The Bhopal gas disaster; a catastrophic industrial accident, was due to a leak of toxic gas, methyl isocyanate (MIC), in the pesticide manufacturing process. The outcome of pregnancy was studied in female survivors of MIC exposure. The spontaneous abortion rate was nearly four times more common in the affected areas as compared to the control area (24.2% versus 5.6%; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, while stillbirth rate was found to be similar in the affected and control areas, the perinatal and neonatal mortality rates were observed to be higher in the affected area. The rate of congenital malformations in the affected and control areas did not show any significant difference. Chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) frequencies were investigated in human survivors of exposure. The observed SCE frequencies in control and exposed groups indicated that mutagenesis has been induced. Strategies for the management, prediction, and preventability of such disasters are outlined.

AB  - Study objective - The aim was to study the relationship between birth prevalence of neural tube defect (including anencephaly) in Eastern Turkey before and after the Chernobyl disaster. Design - This was a prospective study of time trends in live births and stillbirths over the years 1985-1990. Medical and socio-demographic data were recorded for the mothers. Setting - Elazig, Eastern Turkey. Subjects - There were 5240 live births and stillbirths during the study period, 24 of whom had neural tube defect and of these 20 had anencephaly. Main results - Of the 5240 newborns, 24 had a neural tube defect, giving a birth prevalence of 4.5 per 1000 total births. Of these, 20 were anencephalic (3.8 per 1000). In all, of the 2355 conceptions estimated to have occurred prior to the Chernobyl disaster in May 1986, the birth prevalences of total neural tube defect and anencephaly were the same (1.7 per 1000). This contrasts with the years following after Chernobyl, when the birth prevalence of total neural tube defect was 6.9 per 1000 (5.5 per 1000 for anencephaly). The differences were statistically significant (p<0.001). These two increased rates reached a peak of 12.4 (for total neural tube defects) and 8.9 (for anencephaly) in 1988. In 1989 the rate of total neural tube defects decreased to 10.0 and that of anencephaly to 8.6 per 1000. In 1990 the rate of total neural tube defects fell to 5.6 and that of anencephaly fell to 4.2. Conclusions - The changes in birth prevalence of neural tube defects might be due to the Chernobyl disaster. However, the increases observed occurred mainly in infants conceived well over a year after the Chernobyl disaster, suggesting that other factors may be responsible.

AB  - A disaster has been defined as a disruption of human ecology that exceeds the capacity of the community to function normally. Little is known about the adverse effects of natural disasters on reproductive outcomes. Important lessons can be derived from several disasters caused by human factors, such as the Minamata Bay disaster. Adverse reproductive outcomes include infertility, early pregnancy loss, stillbirths, congenital malformations, and serious developmental disabilities such as cerebral palsy and mental retardation. Recent disasters like the Chernobyl and Bhopal explosions have provided important lessons on the need for accurate and sound information about the risk of prenatal exposures for adverse reproductive outcomes. To study questions of adverse reproductive outcomes and disasters requires a well-planned approach. It should include early development of surveillance for adverse reproductive outcomes, analytic studies on the risk of disasters from direct and indirect effects, sensitive methods to measure early pregnancy loss, and long-term follow-up programs to assess outcomes such as developmental disabilities.

AB  - This paper reports the results of a comprehensive survey of the effects of the accidental release of radiation caused by the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in April 1986. The accident and the resulting release of radiation and radioactive products into the atmosphere produced the most serious environmental contamination so far recorded. We have concentrated on evaluating the outcomes and health risks to women, their reproductive situation, and consequences for their progeny. We have concentrated on two well-defined areas: the Chechersky district of the Gomel region in Belorussia and the Polessky district of the Kiev region in the Ukraine. A number of investigations were carried out on 688 pregnant women and their babies, and data were obtained from 7000 labor histories of the development of newborns for a period of 8 years (3 years before the accident and 5 years after it). Parameters examined included birth rate, thyroid pathology, extragenital pathology such as anemias, renal disorders, hypertension, and abnormalities in the metabolism of fats, complications of gestation, spontaneous abortions, premature deliveries, perinatal morbidity and mortality, stillbirths and early neonatal mortality, infections and inflammatory diseases, neurological symptoms and hemic disturbances in both mothers and infants, trophic anomalies, and biochemical and structural changes in the placenta. Several exogenous, complicating influences were also considered such as psycho-emotional factors, stress, lifestyle changes, and others caused directly by the hazardous situation and by its consequences such as treatment, removal from affected areas, etc. The results allow us to conclude that health of mothers, fetuses, and children were significantly influenced by the radiation, with adaptational and pathological abnormalities of various organs and body systems of pregnant women and children. Although the female reproductive system itself remains relatively intact, the decrease in compensatory-adaptive mechanisms of mothers and fetoplacental disorders cause long-term or chronic diseases in the newborns. It is suggested that special attention is paid to possible prophylaxis and to treatment of groups at risk in order to reduce hazardous consequences of such accidents and to preserve the health of future generations.

AB  - Service medical teams were involved in the medical screening and initial reception of displaced Kurds into the first United Nations Relocation Camp in Zakho, Northern Iraq in April 1991. Massive logistic support and adequate security were required for the delivery of the essential elements of relief. The prompt deployment of such teams enabled rapid surveys of the medical extent of the disaster to be undertaken during the screening process whilst individuals were prioritized for rehydration, supplemental feeding and therapy. Over 12,000 displaced persons entered the camp in the first 10 days. Reported perinatal mortality during the two-month exodus crisis in an unselected group of 2,200 was 375 per 1,000 births. In the same group of families surviving to tell the tale, one in five of the infants who had been in the mountains had died and the fertility rate may have been as high as 380 per 1,000 women of childbearing age in the previous year. In a larger survey of 3,825 unselected persons entering the camp, 745 (19.5 per cent) were estimated to be under five years of age and a quarter of these had a significant medical problem. There were 290 (7.6 per cent) estimated to be under two, and a quarter of these were judged to be severely malnourished. A high degree of international cooperation between military and civilian medical and relief teams was demonstrated in dealing with this crisis. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The Chinese population accounts for one-fifth of the world's total, so any change in Chinese mortality will have a great influence on the change of the world population. Before 1949, Chinese population mortality was 25-33%, the high year was 40%, and infant mortality even reached over 250 per 1000 live births. After 1949, the mortality had a rapid decline: it was 20% in 1949, and 14-18% in 1950-1964. But in 1960, mortality went up to 25.43% because of the natural disasters. Since 1965 it has been under 10%. Chinese mortality was 6.58% in 1988. The lowest proportion was 4.95% in Heilongjiang Province. The highest was 7.13% in Yunnan Province. Urban mortality has always been lower than that of the countryside. The urban mortality was 7% in 1965, but it was not until 1978, that countryside mortality had just reached this level. It probably related to the economics, culture, environment, health care and etc. It is worth noting that urban mortality has increased in China since 1981. It was 6.44% in Shanghai in 1981, but it went up to 6.80% in 1988. This condition has been attributed to an aging population and environmental pollution. As family planning has been practised in China, it can be estimated that the Chinese population will be at its height in 2004, and will begin to decrease in 2005. © 1993.

AB  - I believe that the KSSP's claim that all technological issues should be evaluated and assessed only in the context of their impact on the people are borne out by the case studies. Apart from the Silent Valley and the Mothi Chemicals controversies, the KSSP had a positive role to play in other technological and environmental controversies, such as those over river pollution from untreated chemical effluent being dumped in several rivers of the State by chemical and paper companies, nuclear power plant siting, and drug policy. The KSSP's position paper on industries indicates that Kerala has a high concentration of chemical industries, and urges the government to issue no more new licenses for chemical companies. Instead they urge the government to bring in more engineering and electonics industries into the State. The State government has been generally responsive to such calls by actively promoting electronics industry in the State. K.K. Subramanian and K.J. Joseph demonstrate how a "capital-deficient" State like Kerala can stimulate economic growth and employment opportunities in the electronics sector by taking advantage of the considerably well-educated "human resources" of the State. K.K. Subramanian and K.J. Joseph, \ldElectronics in Kerala's Industrialisation,\rd Economic and Political Weekly 23 (1988), pp. 1233\2-1240. The KSSP is in the thick of a debate about the advisability of the establishment of a nuclear power plant in the State as a long range plan to alleviate the acute power shortage predicted for the year 2000. The consensus seems to be that since Kerala is a densely populated State, a continuum of villages and towns and cities from one end to the other situated on the coastal belt, there is no proper site on which a nuclear power plant can be built. However, given the fact that the power availability should be increased and diversified and also that the statistical probability of a nuclear accident is remote, a strong minority in the KSSP is picking up support for a nuclear power plant among the media and the people.Mani, \ldPopularising Science, Fighting Pollution.\rd It appears that KSSP's campaign to reach out to the people to make science and technology instruments of change is quite successful. It is not clear how much their efforts are influencing scientists and technologists at large, who are not associated with the KSSP, to help unleash the potential inherent in science and technology to improve the quality of life of the people. Even though there are no quantitative studies to measure KSSP's contributions to the high literacy rate, low infant mortality rate, and similar indicators of social progress in the State, it is safe to assume that the KSSP's campaign of "Science for Social Revolution" has made a positive contribution to these achievements. Though the KSSP claims to be a non-political voluntary organization, its objective is to raise the consciousness of the people in order to harness the benefits of technology to socio-economic development. The measure of success they have had in educating and raising the consciousness of the people, who might have otherwise remained ignorant or indifferent to technological issues and controversies, is evident. Given the fact that the KSSP is a totally non-governmental and voluntary organization surviving on its own resources, its success in achieving its set goals are remarkable. It is an encouraging sign that similar people's science and technology (S&T) movements are springing up in several States in India, following the foot-steps of the KSSP. After the killing of thousands of people by the Union Carbide chemical plant in Bhopal, the need for many more such people's S&T movements for democratic control of technology has become ever more urgent. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - In Norway, external doses of radiation resulting from fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear accident were estimated from detailed measurements, including soil deposition patterns. Internal doses were estimated from measurements of radioactive cesium in meat and milk supplies. The doses were calculated as average monthly doses for each of 454 municipalities durIng 36 consecutIve months after the accident In sprIng 1986. Prospectively collected data on all newborns listed in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway who were conceived in the period May 1983-April 1989 were used to assess possible dose-response relations between estimated external and food-based exposures and congenital malformations and some other conditions. A positive association was observed between total radiation dose (external plus food-based) and hydrocephaly, while a negative association was observed for Down's syndrome. However, an important conclusion of the study was that no associations were found for conditions previously reported to be associated with radiation, i.e., small head circumference, congenital cataracts, anencephaly, spina biflda, and low birth weight. Potential sources of bias, including exposure misclassification and incomplete ascertainment of cases, are discussed. © 1992 by The Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health.

AB  - Mauritania with an area of 1,085,760 sq. km (419,212 sq. miles) is slightly larger than Texas and New Mexico combined. Its estimated population in 1990 was 2 million with an annual growth rate of 2.9% and an adult rate of 17%. The infant mortality rate is 125/1000 live births; and life expectancy is 46 years. It gained independence on November 28, 1960. Most of its inhabitants are either nomadic herders or settled farmers who live within a subsistence economy. Livestock raising has traditionally generated about 1/4 of the gross domestic product and involved almost 1/3 of the total working population, but since 1983 livestock has been reduced by drought. Between 1981 and 1991 the US provided about 170,000 metric tons of food aid, in addition to bilateral and regional economic assistance. From 1983 through 1989, exports of fish products were Mauritania's leading source of foreign revenue. Participation in the Western Sahara war from 1975 to 1978 proved an expensive disaster, and in 1992 the International Monetary fund and the World Bank negotiated with the government to reform the economy. Between 1983 and 1991, the US provided $67.3 million in development assistance. Following the 1989 rupture between Mauritania and Senegal that resulted in the deportation of tens of thousands of Mauritanian citizens, relations between the US and Mauritania reached a low in the spring of 1991, and the USAID mission in Mauritania halted its activities. Since late 1991 Mauritania has sought to restore stable relations with the US however, all US assistance is suspended until a judicial resolution of the human rights situation is found.

AB  - The characteristics of the Sahel's population of some 44 million inhabitants are fairly well known due to the censuses and surveys that have been conducted in recent decades. All countries in the region except Chad have had at least 2 general population censuses. The Sahel accounts for around 6.5% of the total African population. Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Chad have the largest population in the Sahel, but the highest densities are in Cape Verde (98/sq km), Gambia (83/sq km), Senegal (38/sq km), and Burkina Faso (35/sq km). Over 65% of the Sahel population is rural. Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Chad have some nomads, but sedentarization has been increasing over the past decades because of recurring drought. 30-40% of the population in Chad, Cape Verde, Senegal, and Mauritania is urban. The total Sahel population is 51.3% female and 48.7% male. 47% are under age 15 and 4% are 65 or over. The crude birth rate of 48/1000 is somewhat over the African average of 44. The total fertility rate is 6.5 overall, 7.2 in Burkina Faso, and 5.2 in Chad. About 1% of women in the Sahel use contraception. The highest prevalence rates were 7% in Gambia and 3¿ in Senegal between 1977-87. The crude death rate is 18 in the Sahel, 14 in Africa, and 9 for the world. Public Health interventions have led to significant mortality declines in the region. Cape Verde has the lowest mortality in the Sahel region at 8/1000 in 1991. Average life expectancy at birth is 49 for the Sahel, 53 for Africa, and 65 for the world. Life expectancy ranges from 42 years in Gambia to 66 in Cape Verde. The infant mortality rate of 122/1000 live births has a major effect on life expectancy. Infant mortality rates range from 44 in Cape Verde to 147 in Burkina Faso. The magnitude of migration is not known, but emigration outpaces immigration throughout the region. Internal migration is as important as international migration and is the major factor in urban growth in the region. The natural increase rate of 3.1% is very high. Natural increase ranges from 1.9% in Guinea-Bissau to 3.7% in Mali. The population of the Sahel will double in 23 years if the rate of natural increase in maintained.

AB  - The mean age at marriage in Bangladesh with a population of 110 million has increased from 13 to 1931 to 18 in 1992. Yet 80% of women give birth during their teens. 80% live in the countryside, only 35% complete primary school, and only 22% of women are literate (44% of men). By 1990, girls primary school attendance increased to 45% from 31% in 1970. Between 1960 and 1990 per capita calorie consumption had declined from 2300 calories/day. Maternal mortality was 600/100,000 live births. The projection of a population of 220 million people by 2025 could result in even more dire health prospects for these women. Since independence in 1971, family planning (FP) using paramedics has expanded in rural areas. Nongovernmental organizations supported urban efforts by promoting pills and condoms under the largest social marketing project. The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) increased to 40% by 1991, and the average number of children dropped from 7 in 1971 to 4 in 1990. The main components of child survival are breast feeding, oral rehydration therapy (ORT), and immunization. 300,000 children die annually from diarrhea, but ORT use has surged in recent years curtailing expected deaths in the wake of the 1988 and 1991 natural disasters. In 1991, immunization coverage reached 85% from under 5% in 1985. The expanded program of immunization (EPI) also integrated FP in pilot upazilas (districts) with a simultaneous increase of both CPR and EPI coverage resulting in improved child survival. There are 100,000 EPI outreaches contracting 80% of mothers with FP counseling, iron supplementation, screening risk delivery, vitamin A supplementation, oral rehydration solution distribution, and nutritional counseling. 3 phases of the classical demographic transition have taken place in Bangladesh but the population will keep increasing until stability is reached with fertility and mortality in balance that EPI and FP can help ensure.

AB  - This Basin has a record of frequent outbreaks of floods and waterborne diseases, this has increased significantly with increase in population. A socio-economic survey carried out in the Basin revealed among other things that the most common diseases occurring in the Basin are water related. When compared with others, they are ranked at 50%. These water-related diseases in the area include: malaria, gastroenteritis, dysentary, typhoid fever, schistosomiasis. Also from the survey, a high infant mortality rate was recorded, which was mainly attributed to diarrhoea. The above certainly is an indication of water pollution in the Kano Basin. In this paper, sources and causes of water pollutants, their effects on the environment, especially on human beings, other living things and remedial strategies are discussed. (Author)

AB  - Reproductive rates of Hereford, highgrade Simmental and Belmont Red herds, grazing predominantly improved pastures growing on cleared brigalow country in the subtropics, were compared over 4 joining seasons. There were a total of 24 Hereford, 23 highgrade Simmental and 26 Belmont Red single sire joining groups. Three Hereford and 7 highgrade Simmental sire groups which had abnormally low pregnancy rates, were removed from the main analyses. The Belmont Red herd had the highest (P<0.05) pregnancy, calving and weaning rates (87, 85 and 81%, respectively). Hereford and highgrade Simmental herds had similar pregnancy (78 v. 75%) and calving (76 v. 73%) rates, but the Hereford herd had higher (P<0.05) weaning rates (68 v. 60%). Reproductive rates were affected by seasonal conditions, being lowest in the 1982-83 joining year which followed drought conditions. Depression in productivity, due to seasonal conditions, was greater in the Hereford and highgrade Simmental herds than in the Belmont Red herd. Pre-natal foetal losses from established pregnancy to the start of calving averaged 2.5% of pregnant cows, with no breed effect. Peri-natal calf losses, from the start of calving to 7 days post calving, were lowest in Belmont Red (2.9%) and higher in highgrade Simmental (1 0.2%) than Hereford (5.8%) (P<0.05). The incidence of assisted births amongst primiparous 3-year-old cows was Hereford 11.9, highgrade Simmental 21.7 and Belmont Red 2.5% (P<0.05) and averaged 0.4% amongst multiparous cows, with no breed effect. Birth weights of calves that died during the pen-natal period were 37.0, 42.5 and 35.0 kg for Hereford, highgrade Simmental and Belmont Red, respectively, and were 2.0 kg higher than those of calves that survived to weaning. Post-natal calf losses were lower (P<0.05) in the Belmont Red (1.7%) than in the Hereford and highgrade Simmental herds (5.1%). Birth weights of calves which died postnatally were 2.1 kg lower than those of calves that survived to weaning. Death rates of primiparous cows were Belmont Red 2.0, Hereford 5.8 and highgrade Simmental 11.8% (P<0.10). Amongst multiparous cows, death rates were Belmont Red 0.9, Hereford 2.2 and highgrade Simmental2.9% (P>0.05). © 1982 CSIRO.

AB  - Summary. Since the introduction of neonatal intensive care in the 1960s, mortality in very preterm and very low birthweight infants has been decreasing steadily. Consequently, interest in the outcome of surviving infants is growing. Restriction of health care resources has stressed the need for information concerning the effect of individual treatment components on mortality and morbidity. Concern about the quality in apparently normal survivors has been increasing as well. The current flood of papers on these subjects illustrates the interest in these issues. The first part of this paper reviews the methodology used in follow‐up studies in the past decades. It aims at methodological problems that hamper comparison between studies and preclude unequivocal conclusions. New treatment techniques seldom were but should be evaluated by randomised trials. To monitor the combined effects of changing obstetric and neonatal techniques on perinatal outcome, studies in geographically defined populations are recommended using data from early pregnancy until at least preschool age. Comparability of outcomes could be enhanced by international agreement on standardisation of assessment methods and outcome measures. In the second part the results concerning gestational age‐ and birth‐weight‐specific mortality, impairments and disabilities and the risk factors for such disorders are discussed. Increased survival of even the tiniest infants is clearly established. This increase in survival has not yet been accompanied by an apparent increase in major morbidity. However, many minor impairments are reported, occurring often in combination and predisposing these children to deviations of normal development. Important changes in the manifestation of brain damage appear to occur during development. These findings stress the importance of long‐term follow‐up studies. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - Among primitive tribal communities in India, girls are traditionally married immediately after attaining menarche. In the present study all adolescent girls in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy from 15 randomly selected villages of 4 tribal development blocks of Udaipur district (South Rajasthan State, India) were studied. The data were analyzed with reference to parity, anthropometry, anemia, and other dietary deficiencies. A total of 54 adolescent girls (13-19 years of age) were included in the present study. Of these, 59% (n = 32) were found to be primigravidas, 30% (n = 20) were pregnant for the second time, and 2 girls were pregnant for the third time. A majority were illiterate (n = 46), and almost all of them were found to be suffering from moderate-to-severe anaemia (n = 51). Similarly, a large majority (n = 46) had a body mass index (BMI) less than normal and body weight less than 42 kg. Two of the pregnant girls were also found to be suffering from pellagra, while approximately one-third of the girls had vitamin A deficiency. Only 2 had ever practiced family planning, consisting of some herbal preparations given to them by the folk doctor. Of the study participants, 19 girls (35.0%) were in the third trimester of pregnancy; of these, 7 had evidence of malpresentation or cephalopelvic disproportion. This study highlights the health profile and needs of pregnant adolescents among tribal populations in a drought-affected area in India. © 1992.

AB  - The methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas leak from the Union Carbide plant at Bhopal, India in 1984 was the worst industrial disaster in history. Exposure estimates of gas concentrations in the area range from 85 to 0.12 ppm. Of the approximately 200,000 persons exposed, 3598 deaths have resulted as of November 1989. Chronic inflammatory damage to the eyes and lungs appears to be the main cause of morbidity. Reproductive health problems in the form of increased spontaneous abortions and psychological problems have been reported. Questions about the nature of MIC toxicity have been raised by the persistence of multi-systemic symptoms in survivors. Animal studies using radio-labeled MIC given by the inhalation route have shown that the radio-label is capable of crossing the lung membranes and being distributed to many organs of the body. This paper reviews health effects of gas exposure from published studies and discusses some of the clinical and epidemiological issues being debated.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We analyzed the influence of the radioactive fallout after the Chernobyl disaster on the rate and regional distribution of birth defects and abortion rates in southern Austria. STUDY DESIGN: During 1985 to 1989 a total of 66,743 births was monitored. Twelve sources provided data on 1695 cases of birth defects, 1579 of which were suitable for analysis. All cases were analyzed in terms of their calculated conception date and divided into three main groups according to their vulnerable phase of embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and oogenesis. To study possible regional changes, the findings were plotted in 17 political subdistricts. The overall abortion rate and the counseling frequency at termination clinics was determined. RESULTS: No significant changes in the incidence of birth defects, abortion rate, or counseling rate at pregnancy termination clinics were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing the teratologic potential of low-dose radiation is difficult and requires adequate grouping of birth defects, sufficient baseline data, and highly reliable registries.

AB  - Since the thalidomide disaster in the early sixties many birth defect monitoring systems and registries have been set up to detect changes in the frequencies of specific birth defects. The primary methods of monitoring have been the statistical analysis of data on birth prevalences and teratologic analysis. The yield of this monitoring effect has nevertheless been low when one considers the lack of etiologic factors detected in this way. We therefore propose an additional strategy involving (periodic) classification of all cases in a birth defect registry according to possible risk factors and notified anomalies coupled with a search for specific associations between risk factors and (patterns of) anomalies. We here present data showing the sensitivity of the method. Sensitivity was studied by looking at some already well known associations between risk factors and congenital anomalies in our registry involving 1850 cases. The associations studied were neural tube defects and maternal use of valproic acid, numerical chromosomal anomalies and advanced maternal age, gastroschisis and low maternal age, and autosomal recessive disorders and parental consanguinity. Each of these associations was apparent in the registry, suggesting that risk factor/outcome monitoring as described here is a potentially strong method for finding new etiologic factors in birth defects. © 1992 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between some women's status factors and differentials in probability of child survival in the south-western part of Nigeria. The present analysis is based on the results of the study of children of some 4677 women in two towns contrasting geographical zones. The results of the studiy indicate the significant role of age of mother at first marriage and BCG vaccination while the influence of maternal education was inconsistent at both household and regional levels. Likewise, the possession of certain household items such as dustbin, dining table seem to enhance the survival of children in the urban centres. The results of the study therefore call for strong measures to discourage the marriage of teenage girls. Also, the campaign for use of family planning devices for at least child spacing should be intensified among both mothers and men. Mothers should also be discouraged from patronizing food vendors to ensure minimum balanced diet for their children. Finally, there is need to encourage integrated research efforts on mortality studies so that the fine points of each discipline can be utilized in the multiple research methodology required in order to make headway in the campaigns for child survival and safe motherhood in developing societies. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - An unfortunate concomitant of successful assisted reproduction is multiple gestation, especially of higher orders. There are several means available to avert disaster for one or two healthy fetuses, but there are some who question whether we should use them.; Fetal reduction techniques, experiences at Northwestern University of Evanston, Illinois, USA, and ethical issues are discussed. The use of fetal reduction pertains to higher order multiple pregnancies due to successful fertility treatments. The risk associated with multifetal pregnancy is preterm delivery i.e., 29-31 weeks for quadruplets. In addition, survivors often have a high risk of congenital abnormalities and complications related to prematurity. 1978 marked the 1st time selective termination was possible. Other terms include "selective" birth, reduction, feticide, abortion, and multiple pregnancy reduction. The procedure takes place in the 1st or 2nd trimester, and procedures are similar to an elective abortion but with different techniques. Although there are many techniques, the preferred one is transabdominal cardiac puncture and injection of potassium chloride. A highly skilled ultrasonographer is essential for a successful technique. The complexity of the technique is one where the physician from a 2-dimensional screen must envision a 3-dimensional picture of the uterus and contents. Accurate needle placement is important. The reports from 7 clinical trials using the intracardiac potassium chloride technique are presented. The Northwestern experience includes 25 reductions between 1987-91 using fentanyl and midazolidocaine analgesia and general anesthesia with 1% lidocaine. Gestational age ranged from 9 to 13 weeks. There was total loss in 2 cases and deliveries in 8 cases including neonatal death of a very preterm set of twins. At or = 37 weeks, there were 11 pregnancies. 11 patients were or = 35 years, and 4 of the 20 30 years. In 33% of cases, only 1 pregnancy was left, which is dissimilar to other studies. Many difficulties may be faced with a complete pregnancy loss where there is a lack of support for the decision for fetal reduction. 2 concerns are mentioned in the ethical debate: the adequacy of counseling and the criteria for determining how many reductions per pregnancy. Difficulties arise in physician counseling when patients are unable to assimilate complex and detailed information, and physicians may not accurately convey information. Institutions may bias patient counseling. When an abnormality exists, the decision is easy; but with multiple normal development, the recommendation is twins. The Northwestern recommendation involves patient and family decisions and joint discussion of risk. The likelihood of severely premature delivery and maternal morbidity should also be considered, as well as the medical cost incurred with delivery and care of preterm multiple infants i.e., 1.2 million dollars for delivery of quads at 27 weeks. Science should be directed to reducing multiple pregnancies by refining technique and using fetal reduction as an interim technique. Fetal reduction is not appropriate for all multiple pregnancies.

AB  - The WHO workshop on the impact of the environment on reproductive health is summarized. Topics include the nature of environmental factors affecting reproductive health, environmental factors blamed for declining sperm quantity and quality, the effects of natural and man-made disasters on reproductive health, chemical pollutants, how the environment damages reproductive health, and research needs for better research methodologies and surveillance data. Recommendations are made to: 1) promote international research collaboration with an emphasis on consistency of methodological approaches for assessing developmental and reproductive toxicity, on development of improved surveillance systems and data bases, an strengthening international disaster alert and evaluation systems; 2) promote research capabilities for multidisciplinary studies, for interactive studies of the environment and cellular processes, and for expansion of training and education; and 3) take action on priority problems of exposure to chemical, physical, and biological agents, of exposure to pesticides among specific populations, and of inadequate screening methods for identification of environmental chemicals. The costs of environmental injury to reproduction include subfertility, intrauterine growth retardation, spontaneous abortion, and various birth defects. Developed country's primary threats are from chemical pollution, radiation, and stress. There is a large gap in knowledge. Caution is urged in understanding the direct relationship between environmental causes and infertility. Sexual health is difficult to assess and research is suggested. Exposure to excessive vitamin A and toxic chemicals are cited as agents probably having serious effects on malformations. Sperm quality has declined over the decades; there is speculation about the potential causes. The effects of radiation such as at Chernobyl are described. Toxic chemical exposure such as in Bhopal, India killed thousands. Neurological damage is reported for fetuses and infants exposed to methyl mercury. There is the beginning of evidence that complications of pregnancy may be related to pollution levels surrounding industrial plants. Reproductive health is affected through chromosome damage and cell destruction, prenatal death, altered growth, fetal abnormalities, postnatal death, functional learning deficits, and premature aging.

AB  - Examining Egypt's health care crisis, this article discusses the political factors that have led to such a state. Although Egypt possesses considerable resources and receives vast amounts of US foreign aid, the health status of its people is poor. Infant mortality rate stands at 67/1000 live births; the poor nutritional status of children has not improved over the past 10 years; 1/3 of all children are moderately to severely stunted in growth. The author attributes these woeful conditions to the country's political and economic policies. At one time or another, Egypt has allied itself with USSR or the US, and has generally retained only the worst features of socialism and the free market. While operating as a police state, Egypt has moved towards a free market that has led to the concentration of wealth. The author points out how medical care and medical school reflect the political and economic system. The government guarantees free health care for all and a job to all medical school graduates. But doctors now have to wait 7 years to obtain a post. Many have begun practicing private medicine, and many have become corrupt. The author also singles out the country's diarrhea control program as an indication of the impending health care disaster. Though hailed as high successful, the cost has been exceptionally high, and USAID funding will soon cease. Furthermore, mothers have not been taught self-reliance, but have been made to depend on commercially produced oral rehydration packets. Despite the severity of the social problems, Egypt's security forces have so far succeeded in suppressing popular opposition. But the author does detect hopeful signs in the many active progressive groups, and in particular, in the great social accomplishments of the governor of the providence of Ismailia.

AB  - The authors respond to Tony Dajer's critique of their study concerning the trend in Nicaraguan infant mortality and its possible explanations. It is pointed out that the sharp decline in Nicaragua's infant mortality in the mid-1970s is an intriguing phenomenon, since it began to occur at a time of economic slump, civil disturbance, and under a government that gave low priority to the social sector. It is contended that a number of factors (among them the Managua earthquake) prompted the government to shift its allocation of resources from hospital-based health care in the capital city to ambulatory health care throughout the country. After the revolution, the Sandinista government continued this process. Dajer's characterization of USAID-funded clinics as "notoriously ineffective" is rejected; arguing that although operating under overt political guidelines, these projects are well-advised by experts. Dajer's question as to the importance of health care within the Sandinista government is considered. It is maintained that the revolution was not fought in order to reduce infant mortality, and that health was not the primary concern of the Government of National Reconstruction. It was the international solidarity movement, not the Sandinista government, which focused so intently on infant mortality, hoping to find good news to report. The issue of health care had the added advantage of being politically noncontroversial. It is also maintained that since the mid-70s, the country's health policy has remained stable, despite the radical changes in government because the international arena helps determine national health policy.

AB  - Fourteen years after its occurrence (10 July 1976) the Seveso accident is still considered the prototype for chemical disasters. Thousands of persons were potentially exposed to dioxin after an uncontrolled development during the manufacture of trichlorophenol in a chemical plant. The most evident adverse health effect ascertained was chloracne (193 cases). Other reversible early effects noted were peripheral neuropathy and liver enzyme induction. The ascertainment of other, possibly severe sequelae of dioxin exposure (e.g., birth defects) was hampered by inadequate information; however, generally, no increased risks were evident. Mortality studies shed some light on the long-term effects. An unusual cardiovascular mortality pattern was reported in the exposed population. Cancer mortality findings after 10 years do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn, but are suggestive of a departure from expectations for certain types of cancer; the ongoing cancer incidence study will further explore these hypotheses. A variety of lessons were learned after this accident, and some have been incorporated into international regulations regarding industrial activities and environmental safety. This paper focuses on lessons relevant to the design and conduct of health studies in the aftermath of chemical disasters, with special emphasis given to identification of the study population, ascertainment of individual exposure, and attainment of information. © 1991.

AB  - The genetic consequences of radioactive fall-out deposition from the Chernobyl (USSR) accident in Hungary was evaluated as a part of the ongoing programme on the population-based Hungarian Surveillance of Germinal Mutations. The surveillance is based on three groups of indicator conditions: 15 sentinel anomalies (indicators of germinal dominant gene mutations), Down's syndrome (an indicator of germinal numerical and structural chromosomal mutations) and unidentified multiple congenital abnormalities (indicators of germinal dominant gene and chromosomal mutations). Cases with these indicator conditions were selected from the material of the Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Registry. After the diagnostic accuracies were checked, familial and sporadic cases were separated. Only the latter group was evaluated for evidence of new mutations. The analysis did not reveal any measurable germinal mutagenic effects of the Chernobyl accident. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the rates of these three groups of indicator conditions between regions with higher and lower increased background radiation. © 1991 Oxford University Press.

AB  - The past year has probably been the most successful for the Council on Maternal and Child Health (MCH) to date. I will mention one major activity and two publications which have contributed to increasing visibility for the Council, NAPHP, and our Health Agenda for the ’90s, Universal Maternity Care (UMC). Universal Maternity Care, our name for publicly guaranteed access to comprehensive maternity and infant care, was first conceived by the Council at its inaugural meeting during the APHA’s annual meeting in Montreal in 198 2. At that time, Alan Rosenfield, now Dean of the School of Public Health at Columbia University, suggested that the best strategy for a new organization would be to pick one issue to concentrate on rather than dissipate our limited energy among the many important issues facing MCH. We chose the problem of infant mortality, which we had already recognized as a disaster several years before it became popular to support efforts to reduce infant mortality because of our embarrassing record compared to other developed countries. Improving access to comprehensive maternity care services was selected as the strategy, and three years and several meetings later we were prepared with our proposal, which appeared first in the Journal of Public Health Policy in our article, “Background Paper on Universal Maternity Care” (1). © 1991 Journal of Public Health Policy, Inc.

AB  - Since the thalidomide disaster, there has been increasing concern about the association of therapeutic agents with teratogenicity. Although teratogenicity of thalidomide is now well defined,1 use of the drug is considered safe in nonpregnant patients and has proven useful in the treatment of leprosy reactions and a variety of skin diseases.2,3 Nevertheless, association with birth defects resulted in removal of the drug from the market, which has made it virtually unavailable. Twenty years after the thalidomide disaster, association of the use of 13-cis-retinoic acid in pregnancy with a well-defined syndrome of birth defects has renewed concerns about the teratogenic risk of all drugs in pregnancy.4. © 1991.

AB  - The results of the investigations of radioactive contamination after the Chernobyl catastrophe and subsequent iodine prophylaxis on the thyroid gland function and morphology in Northeast Poland. The aim of the study was to determine whether kalium iodine in one dose during radioactive contamination in Poland limited the radioactive dose in the thyroid gland and if significant disadvantageous side-effects in the intrathyroid and extrathyroid occurred. Additionally during the studies we tried to determine if radioactive iodine contamination which occurred in the region of the Medical Academy in Białystok caused an increase in thyroid disease. It is interesting to note the different results obtained after radioactive contamination with the results from the investigations in this same territory in 1983-1985. In 1983-1985, before the Chernobyl catastrophe, 6,921 persons in Northeast Poland were investigated. In 1986-1988, immediately after the disaster 4,010 persons were investigated. The main study according to grant No MZ-XVII was carried out in three provinces: Białystok, Suwałki and Olsztyn. In this investigation 10,011 persons born before April 26, 1986 and after January 1, 1936 participated, 5,789 townspeople and 4,222 villagers, 3,987 children up to 16 years of age it the time of the disaster 1,973 boys and 2,009 girls; 6,024 adults 2,509 men and 3,516 women were drawn from a register. Committed doses to the thyroid in the investigated region were one of the highest in Poland and depended on age group and were depended on time of prophylaxis non proportional. Iodine prophylaxis was provided mainly with one dose of Lugol solution about 90%, 95% children and 30% adults took iodine. The majority of the population (53.3%-74%) were given iodine in April. From May 1st to 5th 23.0-43.4% received iodine, but after May 5th very few persons. Iodine was well tolerated, but Lugol Solution was better tolerated than other kinds of iodine. Only 241 (4.4%) cases had side effects, mainly vomiting (143), symptoms such as stomach ache, diarrhea, dyspnoe, skinrash etc. in lesser numbers. 12% (29 persons) were seen by a physician. In the investigated population were 200 pregnant women aged 19-40 years of which the majority (177) delivered full term healthy babies. Only 1 interrupted pregnancy and 7 had spontaneous abortion. Changes in the thyroid were noticed by 187 persons (2.3%-11.7%) most of which were enlargement of the thyroid, but only a few were confirmed by a physician. In the studied population from 1989 to 1990 over 30% of the population had struma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - The world's highest fertility rate, a tragic rise in AIDS-related mortality, a long term drought, political instability, widespread malnutrition, and periodic starvation - all ingredients in the current African landscape. Although recognizing that each problem has multiple causes, the author argues that rapid population growth is an underlying factor that exacerbates each of them. Solutions are made more difficult by the continuing increase in the numbers of people. During the first 20 yr after independence, most African countries ignored their population problems, but this began to change in the mid-1980s. Today seven African countries have indicated intentions to decrease population growth and 20 others are formulating policies and supporting family planning activities. Equally important, three countries - Kenya, Botswana and Zimbabwe - demonstrated that vigorous family planning programs, offering easy access to contraceptive supplies and information, could achieve significant increases in contraceptive use and declines in fertility. Improvements over the past 15 yr in infant mortality and in average life expectancy are being erased by a raging AIDS epidemic. There is every reason to think that the political will is emerging in Africa to achieve a substantial reduction in population growth. The successful development of African nations and the improvement in the well-being of their people depend on the success of these endeavors. -from Author

AB  - The rates of fetal loss and family planning acceptance among Bhopal gas victims from 1984 to 1989 were compared to those of a control group. In all, 136 eligible women in the affected area and 139 women in the control area were interviewed. Care was taken to ensure that these women had conceived at least once during the previous five years. The The fetal loss rate among the gas-affected women was abnormally high (26.3 per cent) compared to that of women in the control area (7.8 per cent). Family planning acceptance in both areas was similar, with most women using permanent methods. In the case of temporary methods, the percentage of use was higher in the gas-affected area.

AB  - Previous studies have concluded that radioactive fallout from Chernobyl may have caused an increase in perinatal mortality in West Germany and the U.S.A. The existence of marked geographical variations in contamination from Chernobyl in England and Wales provides an opportunity to investigate this question further by means of a geographical study. The highest doses from Chernobyl in England and Wales were in the counties of Cumbria, Clwyd and Gwynedd where there was heavy rainfall during the passage of the radioactive cloud. However, perinatal mortality in these areas did not rise relative to the national average in the year following Chernobyl. This negative finding was confirmed by a wider study of 14 counties grouped in accordance with levels of radioactive contamination of local milk. It is concluded that this study provides no evidence that radiation from Chernobyl caused a rise in perinatal mortality in England and Wales. © 1991.

AB  - The explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant caused radioactive fallout in Finland in April-May 1986. The fallout was unevenly distributed geographically, and, accordingly, the country was divided into 3 fallout zones. Wholebody radioactivity measurements of randomly chosen persons showed that the regional differences prevailed throughout the following 2 years. Data for legal abortions, registered congenital malformations as well as preterm births and stillbirths of malformed children were collected. The corresponding expected figures were obtained from statistics for 1984 and 1985. No differences in the expected/observed rates of the above parameters were detected. © 1991.

AB  - Pregnancy outcome has been studied in terms of legal abortions, early spontaneous abortions and total number of pregnancies (in an ad hoc study covering 6 counties) as well as various perinatal health problems (on the basis of routinely recorded data for epidemiological surveillance from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway). Apparently, no effects were observed in terms of an increased occurrence of legal abortions, while spontaneous abortions increased from 2.4% of all pregnancies during the last 12 months before the accident to 3% after the accident. At the same time, the total number of pregnancies somewhat decreased. Based on monthly measurements in each municipality of external and internal (food-based) doses, dose-response associations were assessed for a number of perinatal health problems. No associations were observed. © 1991.

AB  - Before Gregg's historic observation [1] rubella was not considered to have clinical or epidemiological importance in any country. In the western world epidemics occurred at varying intervals but with little morbidity and apparently only minor complications. Despite confirmation of Gregg's findings from many quarters, it was not until the worldwide outbreaks in the 1960s that the aftermath of rubella infection in pregnancy was fully realized. As a result of the 1964 outbreak in New York City, more than 1000 children were born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and over 300 pregnancies either aborted spontaneously or were terminated for rubella infection [2]. The number of children affected represented 1% of births in the city; if extrapolated to the whole country this gave an estimated total of 30000 cases of CRS. No such disasters have so far been reported from the developing world. © 1991, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The annual and monthly distributions of congenital abnormalities and pregnancy outcomes as confounding factors were evaluated in Hungary in reflection of the accident at the Chernobyl reactor. The different congenital abnormality entities and the components of fetal radiation syndrome did not show a higher rate after the Chernobyl accident in the data-set of the Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Registry. Among confounding factors, the rate of induced abortions did not increase after the Chernobyl accident in Hungary. In the 9th month after the peak of public concern (May and June, 1986) the rate of livebirths decreased. Three indicator conditions: 15 sentinel anomalies as indicators of germinal dominant gene mutations. Down syndrome as an indicator of germinal numerical and structural chromosomal mutations, and unidentified multiple congenital abnormalities as indicators of germinal dominant gene and chromosomal mutations were selected from the material of the Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Registry. Diagnoses were checked, familial and sporadic cases were separated and only the sporadic cases were evaluated. The analysis of indicator conditions did not reveal any measurable germinal mutagenic effect of the Chernobyl accident in Hungary. © 1991.

AB  - During the months following the accident in Chernobyl, Denmark experienced an increasing rate of induced abortion, especially in regions with the largest measured increase in radiation. As the increase in radiation in Denmark was so low that almost no increased risk of birth defects was expected, the public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands "caused" more fetal deaths in Denmark than the accident. This underlines the importance of public debate, the role of the mass media and of the way in which National Health authorities participate in this debate. © 1991.

AB  - Outreproducing other members of your population is the very basis of natural selection and is the driving force in the evolutionary process, however against taboo discussing over population must be discarded in order to avoid millions of people prematurely dying of hunger and disease and to maintain an environmental balance. The public mentality must be of awareness, humane action, and success in lowering population below the death rate in a very short time. The failure to do so provides fertile ground for warfare, environmental degradation, poverty, racism, religious prejudice, or sexism. America and other rich nations will experience more frequent droughts, damaged crops and famines, dying forests, smog, international conflicts, epidemics, gridlock, drugs, and crime. The authors describe the nature of the population problem and the problem of inaction in dealing with population growth. We swerve within seconds, when confronted with a car in our path, we are outraged at the Alaska oil spill for a few months, yet there is no perception of the danger of a world population growth of 7% in 4 years. Most of the world's population doubt that there are compelling reasons to halt population growth. There are dramatic ways to represent this growth and examples are given. A world population of 10 billion is just around the corner. The environmental problems looming ahead are far greater than anything confronted in the 1960s. Global warming, which leads to droughts and crop failures, and flooding, acid rain, depletion of the ozone layer, vulnerability to epidemics, and exhaustion of soils and groundwater are all related to population growth. Nature will solve the population problem if people do not choose birth control. Those people preventing population control are unaware that early death from widespread famines or epidemics will solve the problem. Scientists belonging to the Club of Earth in 1988 and participating in the international scientific forum, Global Change, in 1989, are aware of population growth's contribution to catastrophe. Media coverage is weak, but major attention is focused on Pope Paul's antibirth-control encyclicals which are an important barrier to solutions. Theoretical positions about the potential availability of food for 40 billion belies the current realities of maldistribution and the management issues in redistribution of foods.

AB  - A study was undertaken to compare the effects of exposure to the toxic gas in pregnant women in Bhopal with pregnant women in a similar, unexposed area. A high incidence of spontaneous abortions (24.2%) in the pregnant women exposed to the toxic gas was observed as compared to those in the control area (5.6%). Other indices of adverse reproductive outcome, such as the rate of still birth and congenital malformation were not found to be different. The perinatal and neonatal mortalities were significantly higher in the affected area (6.9 and 6.1% respectively), as compared to the control area (5.0 and 4.5% respectively).

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between birth intervals and childhood mortality, using longitudinal data from rural Bangladesh known to be of exceptional accuracy and completeness. Results demonstrate significant but very distinctive effects of the previous and subsequent birth intervals on mortality, with the former concentrated in the neonatal period and the latter during early childhood. The impact of short birth intervals on mortality, however, is substantially less than that found in many previous studies of this issue, particularly for the previous birth interval. The findings are discussed in terms of the potential for family planning programs to contribute to improved child survival in settings such as Bangladesh. © 1990 Population Association of America.

AB  - Renin activity and aldosterone concentrations have been determined in amniocentesis samples and fetal plasma obtained by intrauterine umbilical vein puncture in 23 women at 25 to 34 weeks' gestation, normal or complicated by hemolytic disease of the fetus. Prior to the intrauterine interventions, Doppler studies of umbilical arterial circulation were done and 1-hour fetal diuresis was measured. Fetal plasma pH and fetoplacental flood volume were determined. Hemolytic disease was shown to increase renin activity and aldosterone concentration in the amniotic fluid and fetal plasma in parallel with reduction in the fetoplacental blood flow and 1-hour fetal diuresis, increase in vascular resistance of fetal placenta and hypoxia. The increase in renin-aldosterone activity of the fetoplacental unit may be a compensatory fetal and chorionic response to hemodynamic and water-mineral balance in the presence of impaired uteroplacental circulation.

AB  - The epidemiology of Down syndrome (DS) was studied in the area which is covered by our registry of congenital malformations. For each of the 139 new DS cases which were ascertained during the period 1979 to 1987 more than 50 factors were studied and compared to those from control infants. The prevalence of DS was 1.17%; 3.6% of the DS cases were still-births and 14.4% were induced abortions. Karyotypes were obtained in 137 cases of which all but 7 were 47, +21, 4 were mosaics (2.8%), and 5 had translocations (3.6%). Interchromosomal effect was a question in 3 cases. The most common types of associated malformations were cardiac anomalies (44.6%) and intestinal atresia. We did not observe seasonality or time/space clusters in spite of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. No paternal age effect was demonstrated. In our material the first-born infants were at lower risk of DS than the later born. Five percent of the mothers of DS had 2 previous spontaneous abortions (controls 2.8%). At birth, the DS infants measured less and their head circumference was lower than in control infants. Weight of placenta was also lower than in control infants. In our material there were 7.9% of consanguineous marriages (P = .010). The pregnancies of the DS children were often complicated by threatened abortions; 6.4% of the mothers of the DS children were diabetic (P = .069). For all other factors studied no statistically significant difference with respect to controls could be demonstrated.

AB  - Draws on 1984/85 fieldwork by a number of researchers, focussing on the semi-arid northern Sertao (particularly Bahia) anti-drought strategy which has concentrated on construction of large public dams since 1900. Argues that land reform might well have been better, and examines questions of landlessness and access to land and the incidence and impact of drought. Attempts to assess the benefits of large public and smaller private dams, and notes use of water from the dams for irrigation is not effective, in particular, distribution of water for irrigation is often neglected. Advocates more emphasis on aid for livestock rather than large dams and irrigation, and argues that "bottom-up' policies developed from a better understanding of the Sertao agricultural economy would better alleviate effects of drought. Includes maps of: degree/incidence of drought; distribution of wells; and water resources, tables of: infant mortality; nutrition; crop/livestock production; farm size distribution; drought impact on crop yields; farm abandonment; public and private dam construction. There is comment on the major remedial rural development programmes for the Sertao and on the PROVARZEAS irrigation programme. -C.Barrow

AB  - Pregnancy outcome was studied in a county in Norway 3 years prior to and 3 years subsequent to the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident on 26th April 1986. More detailed analyses have been performed for the 12 months prior to and subsequent to the accident. A significant increase in the spontaneous abortion rate the first year after the accident was followed by a slight decrease during the second and third years, but figures were still higher than the period prior to the accident. the rate of legal abortions was unchanged. During the entire observation period the number of births increased continuously, with the exception of a decrease in the last 2 months of 1986 and the first month of 1987. A higher incidence of spontaneous abortions was found for pregnancies conceived during the first 3 months after the accident. This increase in the spontaneous abortion rate is noteworthy, and more especially its long‐term persistence, which cannot be the result of external radiation. the internal radiation from food polluted by radioactive fallout is a possible explanation. Changes in nutrition in order to avoid polluted food may also be of importance. 1990 Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand

AB  - Summary. The worldwide economic crisis enjoins all planners of social services to a principle of relevance and efficiency in the deployment of scarce available resources. On the continent of Africa this is more crucial for the compelling influence of natural disasters and the population explosion. In the field of medical education relevance implies commitment of training programmes to the health needs of the society and in Africa this means addressing crude birth rates of 46 per 1000, death rates of 22 per 1000, maternal mortality of 17 per 10000, infant mortality of 112 per 1000 and a life expectancy of just under 50, statistics which represent the most dismal health indicators for the five continents of the world. The training of the African doctor should therefore ensure intimate familiarity with the environmental and sociocultural influences on health, placing a premium on capability for management of human, material and financial resources and a plan for team‐work. It must also inculcate the appropriate learning strategy which emphasizes the searching and enquiring mind, applying this problem‐solving attitude to the life‐long practice of medicine. It is now accepted by most observers that these objectives are achievable most readily through a translation of the principles of primary health care into educational strategies. The planning of medical educational policy in Africa is thus a formidable task as it is to be done against a background of diminishing resources in real terms and the modern explosion of know‐ledge in science and technology. Selectivity which is sensitive to the service to which education is to be put is currently the most promising means to achieve relevance and efficiency. 1990 Blackwell Publishing

AB  - Provisional estimates from a Save the Children Fund enumeration study in four Ugandan districts indicate that the total number of orphans (one or both parents missing) ranges between 620,000 and 1,200,000. Needs assessments with guardians and local administrators show that although extended family networks are absorbing these children according to traditional rules, they may be vulnerable to increased mortality due to economic and health stresses on their caretakers, many of whom are elderly persons. The orphan burden will increase in Uganda and other Sub-Saharan African countries over the next few years. Allocation of additional national and international resources must be considered to avert breakdowns in community and familial support systems and consequent increases in under 5 mortality. The orphan burden is a window on the potential for massive social breakdown and dislocation in Sub-Saharan Africa resulting from high AIDS-related mortality. Methodologies for data collection and planning that use indigenous political systems must be built quickly to avert disaster. © 1990.

AB  - Summary. The incidence of neural tube defects (NTD) was 2.12 per 1000 births and that of anencephaly was 1.29 per 1000 births when we reviewed the 40 997 consecutive births between 1981 and 1986 in the major maternity hospital in the eastern Black Sea region of Turkey. There was a significant increase in the incidences of NTD and anencephaly after 1986 to 4.39 and 2.46 per 1000 births respectively (P<0.000l; P<0.005). Although this might be a coincidence, it may be due to the nuclear contamination of the region following the Chernobyl accident. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

This review fills a gap by synthesizing evidence for a clinician audience. DATA SOURCES: Systematic scoping review of articles published in PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov from January 2010 through December 2023. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Empirical studies published in English-language peer-reviewed journals, assessing associations between select climate drivers and adverse maternal and birth outcomes. The review included studies examining heat, storms, sea level rise, flooding, drought, wildfires, and other climate-related factors. Health outcomes included preterm birth, low birthweight, small for gestational age, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, miscarriage/stillbirth and maternal mortality. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: The scoping review protocol was registered with the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202410004, January 3, 2024) and conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Data were extracted by 2 authors; quality and risk of bias was assessed independently. RESULTS: Total of 966 references were screened; 16.35% (k=158) met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies (146/158; 92.4%) documented statistically significant and clinically meaningful associations between climate drivers and adverse perinatal health outcomes, including risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, and stillbirth as well as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, miscarriage, and maternal death. Among the most durable findings: extreme heat exposure in early and late pregnancy were associated with increased risk of preterm birth and stillbirth. Driven in part by large (often population-based) studies and objective outcomes from surveillance data or medical record reviews, studies in this scoping review were evaluated as high quality (scoring 7-9 on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale). Risk of bias was generally low. CONCLUSIONS: Climate drivers are consistently associated with adverse health outcomes for pregnant people. Continuing education for clinicians, and clinician-patient communications should be expanded to address risks of climate change and extreme weather exposure, especially risks of extreme heat in late-pregnancy. Results from this review should inform multilevel interventions to address adverse health effects of climate during pregnancy as well as practice advisories, protocols, checklists, and clinical guidelines in obstetrics.";"climate change; environmental health; pregnancy; maternal and child outcomes; scoping review; HIGH AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; BIRTH OUTCOMES; PRETERM BIRTH; HEAT WAVES; PLANETARY HEALTH; RISK; EXPOSURE; PREGNANCY; ASSOCIATION; IMPACT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

If oil spill-exposed women were equally prone to complications in pregnancies that occurred prior to the oil spill as after it, it was considered that any associations were likely due to selection or reporting issues. Women who reported oil spill exposure, particularly loss of use of the coast, were more likely to report gestational diabetes; however, the level of association was similar for pregnancies before and after the spill (p for interaction > 0.10 and odds ratios (ORs) for pregnancies prior to the spill > than those after the spill).

The question arises whether the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident entailed similar phenomena in Japan. For 47 prefectures representing 15.2 million births from 2001 to 2014, the Japanese government provides monthly statistics on 69,171 cases of perinatal death of the fetus or the newborn after 22 weeks of pregnancy to 7 days after birth. Employing change-point methodology for detecting alterations in longitudinal data, we analyzed time trends in perinatal mortality in the Japanese prefectures stratified by exposure to estimate and test potential increases in perinatal death proportions after Fukushima possibly associated with the earthquake, the tsunami, or the estimated radiation exposure. Areas with moderate to high levels of radiation were compared with less exposed and unaffected areas, as were highly contaminated areas hit versus untroubled by the earthquake and the tsunami. Ten months after the earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident, perinatal mortality in 6 severely contaminated prefectures jumped up from January 2012 onward: jump odds ratio 1.156; 95% confidence interval (1.061, 1.259), P-value 0.0009. There were slight increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. In severely contaminated areas, the increases of perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima were essentially independent of the numbers of dead and missing due to the earthquake and the tsunami. Perinatal mortality in areas contaminated with radioactive substances started to increase 10 months after the nuclear accident relative to the prevailing and stable secular downward trend. These results are consistent with findings in Europe after Chernobyl. Since observational studies as the one presented here may suggest but cannot prove causality because of unknown and uncontrolled factors or confounders, intensified research in various scientific disciplines is urgently needed to better qualify and quantify the association of natural and artificial environmental radiation with detrimental genetic health effects at the population level.";"change-point analysis; detrimental pregnancy outcome; ionizing radiation; nuclear accident; radiation induced genetic effect; stillbirth; CHERNOBYL REACTOR ACCIDENT; SEX-RATIO; IONIZING-RADIATION; CHILDHOOD-CANCER; X-RAYS; GERMANY; BIRTH; WOMEN; RISK; STILLBIRTH";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Exposure during pregnancy can influence birth outcomes through mechanisms related to healthcare, infrastructure disruption, stress, nutrition, and injury. However, accurate estimation of health effects may be limited by nonspecific exposure definitions that create potential misclassification. The two predominant hurricane exposure assignments are (1) the county of a FEMA presidential disaster declaration; and (2) the specified area within a storm track. The authors propose a third method: meteorological severity of wind speed. Based on the Saffir-Simpson categories, wind speed was examined through binary and quartile comparisons. All three methods of exposure classification were compared by examining the associations with county-level preterm birth and low-birth-weight rates among Florida women who were pregnant during the 2004 hurricane season. The county-level environmental quality index developed by the EPA was used to control for county-level environmental factors. Although the models yielded unexpected negative results and insignificant rate differences, a descriptive and mapping analysis of the exposure methods showed clear heterogeneity of county exposure.

In the risk analysis of low-birth-weight rate and preterm birth rate, the risk in the coastal region could not be considered any higher than in the inland region (adjusted odds ratio 0.91 [0.73-1.14] and 0.85 [0.46-1.59], respectively). Conclusions: The incidence of preterm birth and low birth weight were not adversely affected by the disaster. Early transfer and intensive medical intervention may have led to those findings. Further survey will be necessary to determine the long-term effects in both mothers and children.";"Great East Japan Earthquake; low birth weight; perinatal outcome; preterm labor; IMPACT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Methods: A multicentre cohort of 9743 singleton births during the wildfire seasons from 1 September 2009 to 31 December 2015 across six cities in New South Wales, Australia were linked with daily wildfire-specific PM2.5 and carbonaceous components (organic carbon and black carbon). Adjusted distributed lag Cox regression models with spatial clustering were performed to estimate daily and cumulative adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) during the last four gestational weeks for preterm birth, stillbirth, nonvertex presentation, low 5-min Apgar score, special care nursery/neonatal intensive care unit (SCN/NICU) admission, and caesarean section. Results: Daily aHRs per 10 mu g/m(3) PM2.5 showed nearly inverted 'U'-shaped positive associations and daily cumulative aHRs that increased with increasing duration of the exposures. The aHRs for lag 0-6 days were 1.17 (95 % CI: 1.04, 1.32) for preterm birth, 1.40 (95 % CI: 1.11, 1.78) for stillbirth, 1.20 (95 % CI: 1.08, 1.33) for nonvertex presentation, 1.12 (95 % CI: 0.93, 1.35) for low 5-min Apgar score, 0.99 (95 % CI: 0.83, 1.19) for SNC/NICU admission, and 1.01 (95 % CI: 0.94, 1.08) for caesarean section.

However, to date, evidence is limited for the association between wildfire-specific PM2.5, a primary emission of wildfire smoke, and adverse birth outcomes.Objective: We aimed to estimate the risk and burden of preterm birth/term low birth weight, associated with maternal exposure to wildfire-specific PM2.5.Methods: A total of 330,884 birth records with maternal information were collected from the New South Wales Australia from 2015 to 2019, covering 523 residential communities. Daily wildfire-specific PM2.5 at a 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees (approximate to 25 km x 25 km) resolution was estimated by a machine learning method combining 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and reanalysis meteorological data. Cox proportional hazards models were implemented to evaluate the association between wildfire-specific PM2.5 and preterm birth/term low birth weight. Number and fraction of preterm birth/term low birth weight attributable to wildfire-specific PM2.5 during pregnancy were calculated.Results: Per one interquartile-range rise in wildfire-specific PM2.5 was found to be associated with 6.9% (HR: 1.069, 95% CI: 1.058-1.081) increased risk of preterm birth and 3.6% (HR: 1.036, 95% CI: 1.014-1.058) higher risk of term low birth weight. The most susceptible gestational window was the 2nd trimester for preterm birth whereas the 1st for term low birth weight. We estimated that 14.30% preterm births and 8.04% term low birth weight cases were attributable to maternal exposure to wildfire-specific PM2.5 during the whole pregnancy. Male infants and mothers aged >= 40, experiencing temperature extremes or living in the inner region, and concepted during spring had higher risks of preterm birth/term low birth weight associated with wildfire-specific PM2.5. Comparatively, mothers with advanced age have a higher risk of preterm birth while younger mothers were more likely to deliver term newborns with low birth weight, when being exposed to wildfire-specific PM2.5. Pregnancy - induced hypertension enhanced the risk of preterm birth associated with wildfire-specific PM2.5.Conclusions: This study strengthened robust evidence on the enhanced risk of preterm birth/term low birth weight associated with maternal exposure to wildfire-specific PM2.5.

A broad literature relates negative birth outcomes to poor educational performance, and a number of recent studies have examined the effect of prenatal exposure to natural disasters on birth outcomes. This study takes the next step by considering how prenatal exposure affects later outcomes. Combining North Carolina administrative data on births and school performance with disaster declarations from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) allows for the identification of children who were exposed to disasters during prenatal development. These children are compared with other children born in the same county who were not exposed to disasters while in utero. Regression results suggest that children exposed to hurricanes prenatally have lower scores on third grade standardized tests in math and reading. Those exposed to flooding or tornadoes also have somewhat lower math scores. Additionally, results suggest that these negative effects are more concentrated among children in disadvantaged subgroups, especially children born to black mothers. However, no evidence exists that these effects are mediated by common measures of birth outcomes, including birth weight and gestational age.";"Natural disaster; Birth weight; Prenatal development; Academic achievement; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; FETAL ORIGINS HYPOTHESIS; PROJECT ICE STORM; MATERNAL STRESS; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; HEALTH OUTCOMES; UNITED-STATES; CHILDREN; ACHIEVEMENT; ENVIRONMENT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Study Design: A comprehensive search of English-language peer-reviewed articles was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection. Various combinations of keywords related to earthquakes and pregnancy outcomes were used. Studies comparing quantitative data on pregnancy outcomes between earthquake-affected and unaffected pregnant women were included.

Floods can increase stress which may negatively impact perinatal outcomes and mental health, but previous research is inconsistent. The objectives of this study are to examine the impact of the flood on pregnancy health, birth outcomes and postpartum mental health. Methods Linked administrative data from the province of Alberta were used. Outcomes included preterm birth, small for gestational age, a new diagnoses of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, and a diagnosis of, or drug prescription for, depression or anxiety. Data were analyzed using a quasi-experimental difference in difference design, comparing flooded and non-flooded areas and in affected and unaffected time periods. Multivariable log binomial regression models were used to estimate risk ratios, adjusted for maternal age. Marginal probabilities for the difference in difference term were used to show the potential effect of the flood. Results Participants included 18,266 nulliparous women for the pregnancy outcomes, and 26,956 women with infants for the mental health analysis.

Notably, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) constitute a significant determinant associated with maternal mortality and adverse birth outcomes. Despite the accumulating body of evidence, scant research has delved into the correlation between chemical components of wildfire PM2.5 and the risk of HDP. Derived from data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics, singleton births from >2.68 million pregnant women were selected across 8 states (Arizona, AZ; California, CA, Idaho, ID, Montana, MT; Nevada, NV; Oregon, OR; Utah, UT, and Wyoming, WY) in the southwestern US from 2001 to 2004. A spatiotemporal model and a Goddard Earth Observing System chemical transport model were employed to forecast daily concentrations of total and wildfire PM2.5-derived exposure. Various modeling techniques including unadjusted analyses, covariate-adjusted models, propensity-score matching, and double robust typical logit models were applied to assess the relationship between wildfire PM2.5 exposure and gestational hypertension and eclampsia. Exposure to fire PM2.5, fire-sourced black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) were associated with an augmented risk of gestational hypertension (ORPM2.5 = 1.125, 95 % CI: 1.109,1.141; ORBC = 1.247, 95 % CI: 1.214,1.281; OROC = 1.153, 95 % CI: 1.132, 1.174) and eclampsia (ORPM2.5 = 1.217, 95 % CI: 1.145,1.293; ORBC = 1.458, 95 % CI: 1.291,1.646; OROC = 1.309, 95 % CI: 1.208,1.418) during the pregnancy exposure window with the strongest effect.

The impacts of climate change on kidney development during gestation and thereby on kidney function later in life have been poorly described. Clinical evidence is summarized to highlight possible associations between climate change and nephron mass. Recent findings Pregnant women are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, being less able to thermoregulate, more sensitive to the effects of dehydration, and more susceptible to infections. Exposure to heat, wildfire smoke, drought, floods and climate-related infections are associated with low birth weight, preterm birth and preeclampsia. These factors are associated with reduced nephron numbers, kidney dysfunction and higher blood pressures in offspring in later life. Exposure to air pollution is associated with higher blood pressures in children and has variable effects on estimated glomerular filtration rate. Summary Climate change has important impacts on pregnant women and their unborn children. Being born too small or too soon is associated with life-time risk of kidney disease. Climate change may therefore have a dual effect of impacting fetal kidney development and contributing to cumulative postnatal kidney injury. The impact on population kidney health of future generations may be significant.";"chronic kidney disease; climate change; developmental programming; low birth weight; preterm birth; GROWTH RESTRICTION; BLOOD-PRESSURE; BIRTH-WEIGHT; HEALTH; RISK; PREGNANCY; MITIGATION; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES; DISEASE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Cross-sectional logistic regression analyses are performed testing the association between pre-HKR accumulation of Pb in soils in thirty-two neighborhoods and eclampsia risk. Then we examine whether measured declines in soil Pb following the flooding of the city resulted in corresponding reductions of eclampsia risk. Results: Cross-sectional analyses show that a one standard deviation increase in soil Pb increases the odds of eclampsia by a factor of 1.48 (95% CI: 131, 1.66).

Women exposed to Alabama tornadoes were less likely to have a preterm birth compared to unexposed mothers (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.91, 0.96). Preterm births among Joplin-tornado exposed mothers were slightly higher (13%) compared with unexposed mothers (11.2%). Exposed mothers from Joplin were also more likely to have a cesarean section compared to their counterparts (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.26).ConclusionsWe found no association between tornado exposure and adverse birth weight and infant mortality rates. Our findings suggest that prenatal exposure can amplify the odds for a cesarean section.

MethodsDepartment of Defense Birth and Infant Health Research programme data identified a cohort of singleton infants born 2010-2011 to USCG personnel in the DWH Oil Spill Coast Guard Cohort study. Infants were included if their military parent ('sponsor') responded to the oil spill during a selected reproductive exposure window (ie, 3 months preconception for male sponsors and periconception through pregnancy for female sponsors), or if their sponsor was a non-responder. chi(2) tests and multivariable log-binomial regression were used to compare the demographic and health characteristics of infants born to spill responders and non-responders. ResultsOverall, 1974 infants with a male sponsor (n=182 responder, n=1792 non-responder) and 628 infants with a female sponsor (n=35 responder, n=593 non-responder) in the DWH Oil Spill Coast Guard Cohort were identified. Health outcomes were similar among the offspring of male responders and non-responders. The frequency of any poor live birth outcome (ie, low birth weight, preterm birth or birth defect) was higher among infants born to female responders (17.1%, n=6) than non-responders (8.9%, n=53); the maternal age-adjusted association was suggestively elevated (risk ratio 1.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 4.16).

The study aims to assess the associations between wildfire air pollution and pregnancy outcomes in the Southwestern United States. Study design: This was a retrospective cohort study. Methods: Birth records of 627,404 singleton deliveries in 2018 were obtained in eight states of the Southwestern United States and were linked to wildfire-sourced fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and their constituents (black carbon [BC] and organic carbon [OC]) during the entire gestational period. A doublerobust logistic regression model was used to assess the associations of wildfire-sourced PM2.5 exposures and preterm birth and term low birth weight, adjusting for non-fire-sourced PM2.5 exposure and individual- and area-level confounder variables. Results: Wildfire-sourced PM2.5 contributed on average 15% of the ambient total PM2.5 concentrations. For preterm birth, the strongest association was observed in the second trimester (odds ratio [OR]: 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.07 for PM2.5; 1.06, 95% CI: 1.05-1.07 for BC; 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03-1.05 for OC, per interquartile range increment of exposure), with higher risks identified among non-smokers or those with low socio-economic status. For term low birth weight, the associations with wildfiresourced PM2.5 exposures were consistently elevated for all trimesters except for the exposure averaged over the entire gestational period. Overall, the associations between wildfire-sourced PM2.5 and pregnancy outcomes were stronger than those with total PM2.5. Conclusions: Wildfire-sourced PM2.5 and its constituents are linked to higher risks of preterm birth and term low birth weight among a significant US population than the effects of ambient total PM2.5.

The empirical literature on the effects of disaster on pregnancy and the postpartum period is limited. The objective of this review was to examine the existing evidence on the effect of disasters on perinatal health. Methods. A systematic review was conducted by searching electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cinahl, PsycInfo), including literature on disasters and pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital anomalies), mental health, and child development. A total of 110 articles were identified, but many published reports were anecdotes or recommendations rather than systematic studies. The final review included 49 peer-reviewed studies that met inclusion criteria. Results. Studies addressing the World Trade Center disaster of September 11 and other terrorist attacks, environmental/chemical disasters, and natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes were identified. Disasters of various types may reduce fetal growth in some women, although there does not appear to be an effect on gestational age at birth. Severity of exposure is the major predictor of mental health issues among pregnant and postpartum women. After a disaster, mental health of the mother may more strongly influence on child development than any direct effect of disaster-related prenatal stress. Conclusions. There is evidence that disaster impacts maternal mental health and some perinatal health outcomes, particular among highly exposed women. Future research should focus on understudied outcomes such as spontaneous abortion. Relief workers and clinicians should concentrate on the most exposed women, particularly with respect to mental health. Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists Learning Objectives: After completion of this educational activity, the obstetrician/gynecologist should be better able to compare and contrast the effects of different types of disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, chemical spills) on pregnant and postpartum women in order to prepare for patient care in the aftermath of such disasters; differentiate the birth outcomes likely to be affected by disaster, in order to identify patients likely to be at high risk; and assess the extent to which pregnant and postpartum women are a uniquely vulnerable population after disaster, to assist in organizing care under such circumstances.";"WORLD-TRADE-CENTER; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; PRENATAL MATERNAL STRESS; PROJECT ICE STORM; PREGNANT-WOMEN; HURRICANE-KATRINA; MENTAL-HEALTH; CONGENITAL-MALFORMATIONS; CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Although research has focused on the impacts on neonatal health from extreme tropical events, little is known about the neonatal health impacts of moderate-intensity hurricanes or hurricanes that reduce intensity before landfall.

The geospatial analysis included multiple buffers of 30, 60, and 100 km to define exposure and local spatial autocorrelation statistics. The results were predominantly insignificant, with some key exceptions. The difference-in-difference analysis found a statistically negative association between hurricane exposure and preterm birth, suggesting an unexpected reduction in preterm births post-storm. We found that exposure to Hurricane Isabel (2003) and LWB were statistically significant at the 30 and 100-km spatial buffers; exposure was also associated with a decrease in PTB at the 30 km buffer. We also examined differences in potential impacts by trimester and found a significant negative association during the second and third trimesters. Significant differences in the clustering of LBW and PTB before and after Isabel made landfall were also found, with new clusters of higher PTB and LBW forming along the storm track.

Associations between exposure cohorts and gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, hypertension, stillbirth, mode of birth, birthweight, preterm birth and small for gestational age were assessed using generalised estimating equations, adjusting for covariates. Results: A decrease in low birth weight was observed for cohort 1 (aOR 0.81, 95%CI 0.69, 0.95). Conversely, cohort 2 showed an increase in low birth weight, and increases in prelabour rupture of membranes, and caesarean sections (aOR 1.18, 95%CI 1.03, 1.37; aOR 1.21, 95%CI 1.07, 1.37; aOR 1.10 (1.02, 1.18) respectively). Cohort 3 showed an increase in unplanned caesarean sections and high birth weight babies (aOR 1.15, 95%CI 1.04, 1.27 and aOR 1.16, 95%CI 1.02, 1.31 respectively), and a decrease in gestational diabetes mellitus was observed for both cohorts 3 and 4. Conclusion: Pregnancies exposed to both severe climate events and pandemic disruptions appear to have increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes beyond only experiencing one event, but further research is needed.";"Bushfire; Wildfire; Pandemic; Perinatal; Pregnancy; COVID-19; Birth; PRENATAL MATERNAL STRESS; AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; PRETERM BIRTH; PREMATURE RUPTURE; OUTCOMES; WEIGHT; NEURODEVELOPMENT; HEALTH; ASTHMA";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Elevated counts of surgeries for cryptorchidism and congenital heart malformations were observed throughout Japan from 2012 onward. The thyroid cancer detection rate (2011 to 2016) was associated with the dose-rate at the municipality level in the Fukushima prefecture. Since the birth weight is a simple and objective indicator for gestational development and pregnancy outcome, the question arises whether the annual birth weight distribution was distorted in a dose-rate-dependent manner across Japan after Fukushima. Methods The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare provides prefecture-specific annual counts for 26.158 million live births from 1995 to 2018, of which 2.366 million births (9.04%) with weights < 2500 g. Prefecture-specific spatiotemporal trends of the low birth weight proportions were analyzed. Logistic regression allowing for level-shifts from 2012 onward was employed to test whether those level-shifts were proportional to the prefecture-specific dose-rates derived from Cs-137 deposition in the 47 Japanese prefectures. Results The overall trend of the low birth weight prevalence (LBWp) in Japan discloses a jump in 2012 with a jump odds ratio (OR) 1.020, 95%-confidence interval (1.003,1.037),p-value 0.0246. A logistic regression of LBWp on the additional dose-rate after the FDNPP accidents adjusted for prefecture-specific spatiotemporal base-line trends yields an OR per mu Sv/h of 1.098 (1.058, 1.139),p-value < 0.0001. Further adjusting the logistic regression for the annual population size and physician density of the prefectures, as well as for the counts of the dead, the missing, and the evacuees due to earthquake and tsunami (as surrogate measures for medical infrastructure and stress) yields an OR per mu Sv/h of 1.109 (1.032, 1.191),p-value 0.0046. Conclusions This study shows increased low birth weight prevalence related to the Cs-137 deposition and the corresponding additional dose-rate in Japan from 2012 onward.

It has also been proposed that stress exposure reduces the ratio of male-to-female births. To date, no study has jointly examined both outcomes, although they may be strongly related. Using population-level data with no selectivity, we jointly study the sex-specific effect of stress on the duration of pregnancy and the observed sex ratio among pregnant women exposed to a major earthquake in Chile. METHODS: In a quasi-experimental design, women exposed to the earthquake in different months of gestation were compared with women pregnant 1 year earlier. Estimates from a comparison group of pregnant women living in areas not affected by the earthquake were also examined to rule out confounding trends. Regression models were used to measure the impact of earthquake exposure on gestational age and preterm birth by sex across month of gestation. A counterfactual simulation was implemented to assess the effect of the earthquake on the secondary sex ratio accounting for the differential impact of stress on gestational age by sex. RESULTS: Earthquake exposure in Months 2 and 3 of gestation resulted in a significant decline in gestational age and increase in preterm delivery. Effects varied by sex, and were much larger for female than male pregnancies. Among females, the probability of preterm birth increased by 0.038 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.005, 0.072] in Month 2 and by 0.039 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.075) in Month 3. Comparable increases for males were insignificant at the conventional P < 0.05 level. After accounting for the sex-specific impact on gestational age, a decline in the male-to-female ratio in Month 3 of exposure was detected [-0.058 (95% CI: -0.113, -0.003)]. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal exposure to an exogenous stressor early but not late in the pregnancy affects gestational age and the probability of preterm birth. This effect is much stronger in females than males. Stress exposure in early pregnancy may also contribute to a decline in the ratio of male-to-female live births in exposed cohorts.";"maternal stress; natural disaster; gestational age; preterm birth; secondary sex ratio; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; DUTCH-HUNGER-WINTER; SELECTION IN-UTERO; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; TERRORIST ATTACKS; PRETERM BIRTH; SEPTEMBER 11; MATERNAL STRESS; FETAL SEX; CRH";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Little is known about the effects of natural disasters on pregnancy outcomes. We studied mental health and birth outcomes among women exposed to Hurricane Katrina. Methods: We collected data prospectively from a cohort of 301 women from New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Pregnant women were interviewed during pregnancy about their experiences during the hurricane, and whether they had experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or depression. High hurricane exposure was defined as having 3 or more of the 8 severe hurricane experiences, such as feeling that one's life was in danger, walking through floodwaters, or having a loved one die. Results: The frequency of low birth weight was higher in women with high hurricane exposure (14.0%) than women without high hurricane exposure (4.7%), with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.3; 95% confidence interval (0): 1.13-9.89; P < 0.01. The frequency of preterm birth was higher in women with high hurricane exposure (14.0%) than women without high hurricane exposure (6.3%), with aOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 0.82-6.38; P > 0.05. There were no significant differences in the frequency of low birth weight or preterm birth between women with PTSD or depression and women without PTSD or depression (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Women who had high hurricane exposure were at an increased risk of having low birth weight infants. Rather than a general exposure to disaster, exposure to specific severe disaster events and the intensity of the disaster experience may be better predictors of poor pregnancy outcomes. To prevent poor pregnancy outcomes during and after disasters, future disaster preparedness may need to include the planning of earlier evacuation of pregnant women to minimize their exposure to severe disaster events.";"depression; disaster; low birth weight; post-traumatic stress disorder; pregnancy; DISASTER; SUPPORT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Design: A descriptive, longitudinal study. Setting: A university-affiliated hospital in Pathum Thani, Thailand. Participants: Pregnant women (N = 175) in the third trimester that had uncomplicated pregnancies and no history of mental illness. Methods: During pregnancy, the participants completed standardized measurements of depression symptoms, perceived social support, and questionnaires concerning the effect of the flood. After giving birth, infant birth weight and gestational age at birth were retrieved from delivery records. Results: Seventy percent (n = 123) of the participants experienced displacement during the flood. The displaced women had a mean infant birth weight of 175 grams less than that of the nondisplaced women, t(173) = -2.38, p = .02, whereas infant gestational age was not different. Displacement and other variables explained approximately 8% of the variance in infant birth weight. The interaction term between displacement and perceived social support was statistically significant and additionally explained the variance in infant birth weight, F(6, 168) = 3.24, p = .005. Conclusion: Being displaced during pregnancy due to a natural disaster affected fetal growth rather than length of gestation. Health care providers should closely monitor maternal weight gain and fetal growth of pregnant women who experience displacement. Among the displaced women, social support was associated with higher infant birth weight; therefore, high levels of perceived social support may be protective for pregnant women who experience stressful events such as displacement from flooding.";"birth outcomes; displacement; natural disaster; social support; HURRICANE-KATRINA; PREGNANT-WOMEN; STRESS; WEIGHT; CARE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Method: The Red River Pregnancy Project was a prospective study carried out for 3 months immediately after the historic 2009 crest of the Red River in Fargo, North Dakota. Pregnant community residents who were at least 18 years old with a singleton, intrauterine pregnancy participated in the study (N = 169). Analyses examined if birth weight and length of gestation were associated with residential distance from flooding and gestational age at time of the flood crest. Results: For pregnancies earlier in gestation during the crest (-1 SD = 12 weeks), birth weight decreased as distance from flooding decreased (-42.29 g/mi, p < .01). For pregnancies later in gestation at crest (+1 SD = 26 weeks), distance was not associated with birth weight (p > .10). Biparietal growth trajectories showed a decrease in growth after the crest of the flood but only for women early in pregnancy. However, various measures of flood related and general stress or strain did not explain these effects. Length of gestation was not associated with distance from or the timing of the flood. Conclusions: Pregnant women in the first trimester who experience a major flood near their homes are at risk of having lower birth weight neonates due to a reduction in fetal growth. The mechanisms of this effect deserve further attention in rapidly mounted investigations after disaster.";"pregnancy; stress; natural disaster; fetal growth; BIRTH OUTCOMES; PRETERM BIRTH; PERCEIVED STRESS; NATURAL DISASTER; BLOOD-PRESSURE; FETAL-GROWTH; ATTACKS; WEIGHT; MODELS; STORM";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Despite the recent hike in the intensity and frequency of wildfires in some regions of the world, a critical appraisal of the evidence on the association between maternal wildfire exposure and adverse birth outcomes has not yet been undertaken. We conducted a systematic review that evaluated the scientific evidence on the association between wildfire exposure during pregnancy and the risk of adverse birth outcomes. Methods: Comprehensive searches in nine bibliographic databases were conducted from database inception up to June 2020. Observational epidemiological studies that evaluated associations between exposure to wildfire during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes were eligible for inclusion. Studies were assessed using the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP OHAT) risk of bias tool and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Screening of retrieved articles, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Study results were synthesized descriptively. Results: Eight epidemiological studies conducted in four countries and involving 1,702,252 births were included in the review. The exposure to wildfire during pregnancy was assessed in individual studies by measurement of PM2.5 (n = 2), PM10 (n = 1), Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aerosol index (n = 1), heat spots (n = 1), and by proximity of maternal residence to wildfire-affected areas (n = 3). There is some evidence indicating that maternal wildfire exposure associates with birth weight reduction (n = 7) and preterm birth (n = 4), particularly when exposure to wildfire smoke occurred in late pregnancy. The association between wildfire exposure and small for gestational age (n = 2) and infant mortality (n = 1) was inconclusive. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that maternal exposure to wildfire during late pregnancy is linked to reduced birth weight and preterm birth. Well-designed comprehensive studies are needed to better understand the perinatal effects of wildfires.";"Wildfire; Pregnancy; Adverse birth outcomes; FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; PRETERM BIRTH; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; AIR-POLLUTION; FETAL HEALTH; WEIGHT; SMOKE; QUALITY; STRESS; PM2.5";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The possible causes and consequences of dehydration in the heat are poorly understood and have been little discussed in the literature. Living in a hot climate poses various challenges, including dehydration, where biological mechanisms and insufficient access to water can lead to dehydration in women and children, with consequences for the health of both mothers and children, particularly in relation to breastfeeding habits.

However, publications on evacuation from NICUs are sparse. The 2016 Kumamoto Earthquakes caused serious damage to Kumamoto City Hospital and its level III regional core NICU. Local/neighbour NICU teams and the disaster-communication team of a neonatal academic society cooperated to evacuate 38 newborn infants from the ward. Objective: The aim of this paper was to highlight potential key factors to improve emergency NICU evacuation and coordination of hospital transportation following natural disasters. Methods: Background variables including clinical risk scores and timing/destination of transportation were compared between infants, who subsequently were transferred to destinations outside of Kumamoto Prefecture, and their peers. Results: All but 1 of the infants were successfully evacuated from their NICU within 8 h. One very-low-birth-weight infant developed moderate hypothermia following transportation. Fourteen infants were transferred to NICUs outside of Kumamoto Prefecture, which was associated with the diagnosis of congenital heart disease, dependence on respiratory support, higher risk scores, and longer elapsed time from the decision to departure. There was difficulty in arranging helicopter transportation because the coordination office of the Disaster Medical Assistance Team had requisitioned most air/ground ambulances and only helped arrange ground transportations for 13 low-risk infants. Transportation for all 10 high-risk infants (risk scores greater than or equal to the upper quartile) was arranged by local/neighbour NICUs. Conclusions: Although the overall evacuation process was satisfactory, potential risks of relying on the adult-based emergency transportation system were highlighted. A better system needs to be developed urgently to put appropriate priority on vulnerable infants. (C) 2017 S.

Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and volcanic eruptions, have been known to disrupt ecosystems and human populations, leading to both short-term and long-term consequences. Studies have suggested a potential influence of these disasters on the SSR, with varying degrees of impact observed across different regions and disaster types. Similarly, nuclear accidents, such as the infamous Chernobyl disaster, have sparked interest in their potential effects on human health and development. The release of radioactive materials into the environment can have far-reaching consequences, including impacts on reproductive outcomes. Through a rigorous examination of the existing literature, the present review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the impacts of natural disasters and nuclear accidents on the SSR and unravel the mechanisms that explain SSR fluctuations. By shedding light on the diverse influences shaping the SSR, this narrative review contributes to a deeper appreciation of the intricate interplay between environmental, biological, and societal factors that determines the SSR, calling for targeted strategies to mitigate potential adverse effects on sex ratios in the aftermath of such events.";"secondary sex ratio; natural disaster; nuclear energy; earthquakes; reproductive health; population dynamics; public health; PARENTAL HORMONE-LEVELS; EAST JAPAN EARTHQUAKE; SELECTION IN-UTERO; RECURRENT MISCARRIAGE; HURRICANE KATRINA; KOBE EARTHQUAKE; HUMAN HEALTH; BIRTH; IMPACT; CHERNOBYL";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Understanding the infiltration of outdoor wildfire smoke into a residential space is critical for the accurate assessment of wildfire smoke exposure and associated health effects in pregnant people. Relying on ambient measurements of wildfire smoke alone can result in exposure misclassification. In this study, we examine the role of physical housing characteristics in the relationship between smoke exposure and preterm birth. In particular, we examine the effect of home size, year of construction, cooling type, and renovation status, as effect modifiers in the relationship between smoke exposure during pregnancy and preterm birth from 2007 to 2015 in California. To do this, we combined data on home characteristics from the California Tax Assessor, birth outcomes from the California birth records database, and the number of smoke days for each pregnancy from theNOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Hazard Mapping System (HMS). We estimated the association between smoke day exposures and odds of preterm birth using logistic regression models and stratified by air basin and housing characteristics. Our findings reveal that cooling type and renovation status are key factors modifying the smoke exposure-preterm birth relationship. Notably, we found elevated associations for people living in unrenovated homes, those using evaporative cooling systems, and those using central air conditioning units. While we observed elevated odds of preterm birth associated with increasing smoke day exposure for residents of large and new homes, this effect does not significantly differ across home size and age quartiles. This study highlights the need to further examine the relative roles of housing characteristics as well as factors not measured here including behavioral factors, time spent outdoors, window use, and occupational exposures in driving adverse birth outcomes related to wildfire smoke exposure";"Air pollution; Wildfire smoke; Housing; Pregnancy; Preterm birth; Housing quality; AIR-POLLUTION; PM2.5; PREGNANCY; WEIGHT; RISK; FIRE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

This review summarizes recent literature regarding the impacts of climate change and related environmental disasters on pregnancy health and provides recommendations to inform future adaptation and mitigation efforts. Recent Findings Accumulating evidence suggests that the changing climate affects pregnancy health directly via discrete environmental disasters (i.e., wildfire, extreme heat, hurricane, flood, and drought), and indirectly through changes in the natural and social environment. Although studies vary greatly in design, analytic methods, and assessment strategies, they generally converge to suggest that climate-related disasters are associated with increased risk of gestational complication, pregnancy loss, restricted fetal growth, low birthweight, preterm birth, and selected delivery/newborn complications. Window(s) of exposure with the highest sensitivity are not clear, but both acute and chronic exposures appear important. Furthermore, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations may be more vulnerable. Policy, clinical, and research strategies for adaptation and mitigation should be continued, strengthened, and expanded with cross-disciplinary efforts. Top priorities should include (a) reinforcing and expanding policies to further reduce emission, (b) increasing awareness and education resources for healthcare providers and the public, (c) facilitating access to quality population-based data in low-resource areas, and (d) research efforts to better understand mechanisms of effects, identify susceptible populations and windows of exposure, explore interactive impacts of multiple exposures, and develop novel methods to better quantify pregnancy health impacts.";"Climate change; Environmental disaster; Extreme weather; Pregnancy health; Perinatal health; ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES; AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; RESIDENTIAL PROXIMITY; MATERNAL EXPOSURE; FOOD INSECURITY; OCCUPATIONAL-EXPOSURE; TEMPERATURE EXPOSURE; DRINKING-WATER; NORTH-CAROLINA; INCREASED RISK";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Using population-representative multilevel longitudinal data, we identify a behavioral fertility response to mortality exposure, both at the level of a couple and in the broader community. We observe a sustained fertility increase at the aggregate level following the tsunami, which was driven by two behavioral responses to mortality exposure. First, mothers who lost one or more children in the disaster were significantly more likely to bear additional children after the tsunami. This response explains about 13 % of the aggregate increase in fertility. Second, women without children before the tsunami initiated family-building earlier in communities where tsunami-related mortality rates were higher, indicating that the fertility of these women is an important route to rebuilding the population in the aftermath of a mortality shock.

Methods We used data on 342,942 singleton births from Florida Vital Statistics Records 2004-2005 to capture pregnancies at risk of delivery during the 2004 hurricane season. Maternal exposure to Hurricane Charley was assigned based on maximum wind speed in maternal county of residence. We estimated hazards of overall preterm delivery (<37 gestational weeks) and extremely preterm delivery (<32 gestational weeks) in Cox regression models, adjusting for maternal/pregnancy characteristics. To evaluate heterogeneity among racial/ethnic subgroups, we performed analyses stratified by race/ethnicity. Additional models investigated whether exposure to multiples hurricanes increased hazard relative to exposure to one hurricane. Results Exposure to wind speeds >= 39 mph from Hurricane Charley was associated with a 9 % (95 % CI 3, 16 %) increase in hazard of extremely preterm delivery, while exposure to wind speed >= 74 mph was associated with a 21 % (95 % CI 6, 38 %) increase. Associations appeared greater for Hispanic mothers compared to non-Hispanic white mothers. Hurricane exposure did not appear to be associated with hazard of overall preterm delivery.

People who reside in a particular area may be more vulnerable to particular EWE types, which may result in different preferences for fertility and gender. This study employed individual-level data from three places (flood-prone, drought-prone, and cyclone-prone), each exposed to a distinct hazard, to address this issue, and collected pertinent information from 177 respondents in the susceptible areas using a survey questionnaire. The quantitative results show that the gender of the first child, the perceived risk of infant death due to EWE, the opinion on having more children to recover from the damage and losses caused by EWE, government and non-governmental organization (NGO) support during EWE, and the intended timing of child bearing (after or before EWE) are all significant factors influencing fertility preferences and gender preferences. The findings also indicate that the three regions under investigation have statistically distinct preferences for fertility and gender.

Among the subsample of mothers most susceptible to stress first-time, single mothers low birth weight was 0.5 percentage points more likely to occur. We find little evidence that the earthquake affected preterm delivery. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although some research has been conducted into the adverse health impacts of POs, significant gaps remain regarding whether POs would affect the health of pregnant women. We investigated the association between ED visits due to pregnancy complications and the occurence, intensity, and duration of large-scale POs in eight Sandy-affected counties in New York State (NYS). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, daily ED visits for pregnancy complications and large-scale POdata in eight counties in NYS from October to December in 2005-2014 were collected. Using time-series analysis, we estimated the relative increase in ED visits for pregnancy complications during POs compared with non-PO periods at lag 0-7 days. Short-term health impacts of PO intensity and PO duration were investigated. Estimations were also stratified by sociodemographic characteristics and disease subtypes including threatened or spontaneous abortion, threatened or early labor, hypertension complications, infections of genitourinary tract, renal diseases, gestational diabetes mellitus, mental illnesses, and cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy. Results: From October to December in 2005-2014, there were 307,739 ED visits for pregnancy complications in the eight counties. We found significant increases in ED visits for overall pregnancy complications (16.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.3%, 23.2%) during the Hurricane-PO period at lag 0-7 days. The ED visits increased by 8.8% per level increase in PO intensity and 1.4% per day increase in PO duration. Specifically, threatened/ early delivery and gestational diabetes mellitus during the PO period increased by 26.7% (95% CI: 8.2%, 48.4%) and 111.8% (95% CI: 16.7%, 284.4%), respectively. Young adult, Black, Hispanic, and uninsured individuals were at higher risk of complications.

However, no studies in Japan have classified infant mortality trends into neonatal and postneonatal or considered regional issues. This study aimed to explore trends in neonatal and postneonatal deaths, both overall for Japan and in a region affected by a natural disaster. Methods: Drawing on national infant death data, we used a multi-attribute compositional study design to examine all infant deaths occurring in a region affected by a disaster (Tohoku, which consists of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima) between 2002 and 2012. We used conjoint analysis to clarify the associations between infant and maternal characteristics and age of infant death. Results: We obtained data of a total of 31,012 infant deaths between 2002 and 2012, which included 1450 from Tohoku. Infant mortality rates in Japan overall declined over the period but increased in 2011. There were more postneonatal (29-364 days post-birth) than neonatal (0-28 days post-birth) deaths. Infant deaths in Tohoku declined slightly overall, with a fluctuation in 2011. In Tohoku, the trends in postneonatal death rates were similar; the overall rates for males increased, but those for females decreased in 2011. We found that the cause and place of infant death differed by gender for neonatal and postneonatal deaths in both Japan in general and Tohoku. The conjoint analysis showed that most variables affected the age of postneonatal death. The factor with the largest influence on the variation in infant death age was gestational week (55.5%). A maternal gestational week <= 36 was linked to an average age at death of 43.4 days, and > 37 was linked to an average of 83.7 days. Conclusions: In Japan, infant death rates have declined steadily over the past 10 years. The recent trends indicated that postneonatal death rates were higher than neonatal rates, especially in Tohoku. However, not much attention has been focused on postneonatal deaths in Japan. Our findings may help health planners to prioritise work on the factors that are linked to infant deaths in the neonatal and postneonatal periods.";"Trends in infant mortality; Neonatal/postneonatal; Causes of death; Conjoint analysis; Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami; Japan; IMPACT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

To address these issues, the Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) Center was formed in 2010 to investigate prenatal environmental exposures, particularly phthalates, and adverse birth outcomes. Recent work from the PROTECT study confirms that in utero exposure to certain phthalates is associated with shorter gestation and increased risk of preterm birth. However, previous research also suggests that pregnant women who experience a natural disaster such as Hurricane Maria are at higher risk of adverse birth outcomes, but it is unknown whether this is due to stress, hazardous exposures, or a combination of factors. Thus, the aim of this analysis was to characterize hurricane-related changes in phthalate exposures and experiences within the PROTECT cohort. Among 176 participants who were pregnant during or within 5 months after Maria, 122 completed a questionnaire on hurricane-related experiences. Questionnaire results and biomarkers of exposure suggest that participants did not have regular access to fresh foods and water during hurricane recovery, and almost half reported structural damage to their home. In addition, biomarker concentrations of phthalates commonly used in food packaging were higher among participants post-hurricane, while phthalates commonly used in personal care products were lower compared to pre-hurricane levels. Hurricane-related increases in phthalate exposure, as well as widespread structural damage, food and water shortages, and long-term absence of electricity and cell phone service, likely increased the risk of adverse birth outcomes among this already vulnerable population.";"Puerto Rico; Hurricane Maria; Pregnancy; Birth cohort; Environmental exposures; PHTHALATE EXPOSURE; REPRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES; PREGNANCY; STRESS; HEALTH; WOMEN; FETAL; DISASTERS; CONSEQUENCES; EPIDEMIOLOGY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Low birth weight (LBW) is a critical global health concern, contributing to neonatal mortality. However, the association between floods and LBW remains underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the association between flood hazards and LBW in India using a geospatial approach. By analyzing data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) and flood zonation maps, the study aims to uncover the spatial dynamics of this association, offering insights into the implications of floods on birth weight across diverse geographical regions.Methods: The study used the fifth round of NFHS data, 2019-21, which involved 202,194 children selected through a multi-stage stratified sampling technique. The Vulnerability Atlas of India 2019 maps were also uti-lized to classify areas as flood or non-flood zones. Birth weight data from the NFHS-5 were categorized into three groups: very low, low, and normal birth weight (VLBW, LBW and NBW). Control variables including flood exposure, socio-demographic attributes, and geographic region were considered. Bivariate analysis and multi-nomial logistic regression were employed for statistical analysis. The spatial analysis involved Moran's I statistics and Geographically Weighted Regression to explore spatial dynamics of the association between floods and birth weight in India.Results: Floods predominantly affect India's lower Himalayan belts and western coastal regions. Flood-affected areas show higher proportions of VLBW and LBW infants. Groundwater usage and unimproved sanitation are associated with higher risk of VLBW and LBW. Sex, wealth, maternal education, residence type, and geographic region significantly influence birth weights. Multinomial logistic regression reveals 8 % and 27 % higher risks for LBW and VLBW in flood-affected regions. LISA cluster maps identify high-risk areas for both LBW and floods. Geographically Weighted Regression highlights 52 % of the variability in LBW occurrences can be attributed to the influence of flood hazards. Families hailing from the poorest wealth background and exposed to flood hazards bear a 5 % heightened likelihood of delivering LBW infants, in stark contrast to their counterparts from the same economic background yet unaffected by floods.Conclusions: The significant association between floods and LBW underscores the importance of robust disaster preparedness and public health strategies. By unraveling the spatial intricacies of flood-induced LBW disparities, this research provides valuable insights for promoting healthier birth outcomes and reducing child mortality rates, particularly in flood-prone regions. These findings emphasize the importance of holistic policies that address both environmental challenges and socioeconomic inequalities to safeguard maternal and infant health across the nation.";"Flood; Low birth weight; Geospatial analysis; Environmental health; NFHS-5; STRESS; DISASTER; OUTCOMES; HEALTH; IMPACT; AREA";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

In the current literature, mixed associations have been suggested between hurricane exposure and reproductive health outcomes. This may be due, in part, to residual confounding. We assessed the association between hurricane exposure and reproductive health outcomes by using a difference-in-difference analysis technique to control for confounding in a cohort of Florida pregnancies. Methods: We implemented a difference-in-difference analysis to evaluate hurricane weather and reproductive health outcomes including low birth weight, fetal death, and birth rate. The study population for analysis included all Florida pregnancies conceived before or during the 2003 and 2004 hurricane season. Reproductive health data were extracted from vital statistics records from the Florida Department of Health. In 2004, 4 hurricanes (Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne) made landfall in rapid succession; whereas in 2003, no hurricanes made landfall in Florida. Results: Overall models using the difference-in-difference analysis showed no association between exposure to hurricane weather and reproductive health.

Studies on epidemiology have identified correlations between PM2.5 exposure to wildfire smoke and mortality, respiratory and cardiovascular morbidities, and may result in a reduction in birth weight. However, evidence from Indonesia is limited. For this study, a retrospective cohort epidemiological study was undertaken to quantify the Indonesian population's exposure to wildfire-PM2.5. We present 9652 (88%) records of newborns to identify an association between fire-sourced PM2.5 and birth weight in Palangka Raya, Indonesia from 2015 to 2019. On an annual basis, geospatial, and season variations in wildfire-PM2.5 concentrations were observed using a satellite-based dataset from CAMS and used for gestational exposure to wildfire smoke. Applying a general linear model with birth weight (yi) as a continuous outcome, the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and low birth weight was examined. In addition, the binary outcome of low birth weight was analysed. A statistically significant difference in the birth weight reduction between infants delivered to mothers exposed to high levels of wildfire smoke and those exposed to low levels of wildfire smoke was observed over the entire time frame (2015-2019) (rho-value < 0.001). In comparison to infants born to mothers exposed to lower concentrations, the birth weight of infants delivered to mothers exposed to high concentrations of PM2.5 in the third trimester decreased by 19.96%. A 1.9% reduction in birth weight could be caused by exposure during the fire-prevalent in the first trimester of pregnancy (rho-value < 0.001). Since an estimation model predicted a 10 g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 exposure between the first and last trimesters of pregnancy, variations in the second trimester did not significantly affect the association (rho-value = 0.761). This emphasizes the significance of foetal development during these two trimesters.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of singleton births using administrative birth records in the nine-county greater Houston area from 2015 to 2019.

RESULTS: Database searches identified 480 records. Following title, abstract, and full text screening, sixteen studies published between 2012 and 2022 were identified for this review. Eleven studies considered an association between in utero exposure to wildfire and impacts on birth weight and length of gestation. One study reported increased rates of maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and gestational hypertension following exposure; whereas one study reported differences in the secondary sex ratio. Two studies reported higher incidence of birth defects following in utero exposure to wildfire smoke. Three studies reported increased mental health morbidity, and one study associated a reduction in breastfeeding among women who evacuated from a wildfire disaster. DISCUSSION: Evidence indicates that wildfire exposure may be associated with changes to birth outcomes and increased morbidity for childbearing women and their babies. These effects may be profound and have long-term and wide-ranging public health implications. This research can inform the development of effective clinical and public health strategies to address the needs of childbearing women exposed to wildfire disaster.";"PRENATAL MATERNAL STRESS; FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; SECONDARY SEX-RATIO; PRETERM BIRTH; IN-UTERO; EXPOSURE; WEIGHT; PREGNANCY; QUEENSLAND; DISORDERS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Objectives: To examine the relationship between oil spill exposure and birth outcomes in a cohort of women living near the Gulf of Mexico at the time of the 2010 oil spill. Methods: Between 2012 and 2016, 1375 women reported their exposure to the oil spill, and at least one livebirth. Five hundred and three had births both before and after the oil spill. Indicators of oil spill exposure included selfreported financial consequences, direct contact with oil, traumatic experiences, loss of use of the coast, and involvement in litigation. Birth outcomes were low birthweight (LBW; birthweight <2500 g) and preterm birth (PTB; >3 weeks early). Women who were not pregnant at the time of the interview (n = 1001) self-reported outcomes, while women who were pregnant (n = 374) primarily had them abstracted from medical records (n = 374). All pregnancies prior to the oil spill were considered unexposed; those after the oil spill were considered exposed or unexposed depending on interview responses. Generalized estimating equations were used to control for clustering within women, with control for confounders. Results: The most common type of exposure was economic (49%), but 302 women (22.0%) reported some degree of direct contact with the oil. Associations between most indicators of oil spill exposure and pregnancy outcomes were null, although when all pregnancies were examined, associations were seen with high levels of contact with oil for LBW (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 2.19, 95% CI, 1.29-3.71) and PTB (aOR 2.27, 1.34-3.87). Discussion: In this community-based cohort, we did not find associations between report of exposure to the oil spill, with the possible exception of high oil contact in some analyses, and birth outcomes.

Associations were also found between climate-related events and increased gender-based violence and HIV prevalence, as well as fertility decisions and harmful practices such as female genital mutilations and early and forced marriages. About two-thirds (48/75) of the articles were from the African or Western Pacific regions.

We weighted the multivariable logistic models based on the combination of coarsened exact matching (CEM) weight and survey weight, and performed sex-stratified analysis to test whether associations of maternal earthquake exposure with adverse birth outcomes (Stillbirth, preterm birth [PTB], low birthweight [LBW], and small for gestational age [SGA]) varied by sex. Results The bivariate models showed that the weighted incidence of each adverse birth outcome was higher in exposed group than unexposed group: stillbirth (2.00% vs. 1.33%), PTB (14.14% vs. 7.32%), LBW (10.82% vs. 5.76%), and SGA (11.32% vs. 9.52%). The multivariable models showed maternal earthquake exposure was only associated significantly with a higher risk of PTB in offspring among all births (adjusted risk ratio [aRR](95%CI):1.25(1.06-1.48),P = 0.010). The sex-stratified analysis showed the association was significant among male births (aRR (95%CI): 1.40(1.12-1.75),P = 0.002),but unsignificant among female births. The sensitivity analysis reported similar findings. Conclusions The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake exposure has a long-term effect on PTB.

Specifically, I exploit the geographic intensity of extreme floods in Ecuador during the 1997-1998 El Nino phenomenon, which provides exogenous variation in exposure at different periods of early development. I show that children exposed to severe floods in utero, especially during the third trimester, are shorter in stature five and seven years later. Also, children affected by the floods in the first trimester of pregnancy score lower on cognitive tests. Additionally, I explore potential mechanisms by studying health at birth and family inputs (income, consumption, and breastfeeding). I find that children exposed to El Nino floods, especially during the third trimester in utero, were more likely to be born with low birth weight. Furthermore, households affected by El Nino suffered a decline in income, total consumption, and food consumption in the aftermath of the shock.

The short-notice evacuation had destabilizing consequences for residents, including changes in routines, loss of control, and increased uncertainty. These consequences were especially detrimental to women who were pregnant or pre-conception during the evacuation. Pregnant and pre-conception women are particularly susceptible to a vast range of negative consequences during and post natural disasters, including elevated stress and higher incidence of pregnancy complications including gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy induced hypertension and C-section. The aim of this study was to understand the experiences, perceived stress and resilience of women who were pregnant during the wildfire. As well as to explore potential interventions to promote the health and enhance resilience of pregnant women and to assist in recovery after exposure to a natural disaster or other traumatic events. MethodsA qualitative thematic analysis of 16 narratives penned by pregnant women and recounted in Ashley Tobin's compilations 93/88,000 and 159 More/ 88,000: Stories of Evacuation, Re-Entry and the In-Between was conducted. ResultsAnalysis revealed five key themes: (1) experience of stress responses due to personal and external factors, (2) social connectedness and support as a facilitator of resilience, (3) performance of resilience-enhancing activities, (4) the roles of pregnancy and motherhood in the experiences of loss and resilience, and (5) the importance of home. ConclusionPregnant women have unique barriers that may negatively impact them during a natural disaster or other form of stressful event. They may benefit from assistance with navigating role transition during pregnancy, training in stress management strategies, and writing interventions to build resiliency and begin the process of recovery from trauma.";"stress; resilience; pregnancy; natural disasters; factors of resilience; PRENATAL MATERNAL STRESS; NATURAL DISASTER; BIRTH OUTCOMES; IDENTITY; MOTHER";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Earthquakes can intensively impact the birth outcomes upon psychological and morphological development of the unborn children, albeit detailed characteristics remain obscure. Methods and Findings: We utilized the birth records at Du Jiang Yan and Peng Zhou counties to investigate the birth outcomes as a consequence of a major earthquake occurred in Wenchuan, China on May 12, 2008. Totally 13,003 of neonates were recorded, with 6638 and 6365 for pre- and post-earthquake, respectively. Significant low birthweight, high ratio of low birthweight, and low Apgar scores of post-earthquake group were observed. In contrast, the sex ratio at birth, birth length and length of gestation did not show statistical differences. The overall ratio of birth-defect in the post-earthquake (1.18%) is statistically high than that of pre- earthquake (0.99%), especially for those in the first trimester on earthquake day (1.47%). The birth-defect spectrum was dramatically altered after earthquake, with the markedly increased occurrences of ear malformations. The ratio of preterm birth post-earthquake (7.41%) is significant increased than that of pre- earthquake (5.63%). For the birth outcomes of twins, significant differences of the ratio of twins, birth weight, ratio of low birthweight and birth-defect rate were observed after earthquake.

Puerto Rico-a U.S. territory with a colonial history-offers a unique case for examining how multiple disasters, including Hurricane Maria, ongoing earthquakes, and the COVID-19 pandemic, interact with structural vulnerabilities to affect maternal and child health. Despite increasing attention to climate-related health outcomes, little is known about the reproductive health impacts of cumulative disaster exposure in colonial contexts.MethodsWe used U.S. National Vital Statistics System data (2017-2021) to assess associations between disaster exposure and six maternal and newborn outcomes: preterm birth, low birthweight, term low birthweight, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, and excessive weight gain. Disaster exposure was defined based on the timing of hurricanes and the pandemic, using a three-month lag period. We analyzed data from Puerto Rico and used Florida and Texas as comparison sites. Multivariable log-binomial regression models estimated adjusted prevalence ratios. Effect modification was tested for (1) region within Puerto Rico and (2) colonial status, comparing Puerto Rico (territory) to Florida and Texas (states). Simulations were conducted to account for potential live-birth bias.ResultsAcross 104,560 births in Puerto Rico, disaster periods were consistently associated with worse maternal health outcomes. For example, during the late post-hurricane period, gestational diabetes increased (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31), while term low birthweight surprisingly appeared to decline (RR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.98). Associations with newborn health were mixed and may have been underestimated due to sharp declines in live births after disasters. Simulations suggested stronger disaster-related risks than observed in primary analyses. Effect modification by region and colonial status showed inconsistent but notable differences, particularly elevated maternal health risks in certain regions of Puerto Rico and compared to U.S. states.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that multiple disasters negatively affect reproductive health in Puerto Rico and that structural factors, including colonialism, may exacerbate these impacts. Public health responses must account for cumulative disaster exposure and systemic inequities to better support maternal and child health in marginalized settings, especially as climate change continues to intensify.";"Maternal health; Child health; Disasters; Colonialism; Climate change; Puerto Rico; Health inequities; Reproductive health; COVID-19 pandemic; Environmental Justice; ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES; HURRICANE-KATRINA; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; PREGNANCY; IMPACT; DISPARITIES; RESILIENCE; DEPRESSION; DISASTERS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

However, a comprehensive synthesis of the current evidence on the health impacts of ambient wildfire smoke on children and adolescents, an exceptionally vulnerable population, is lacking. We conduct a systematic review of peer-reviewed epidemiological studies on the association between wildfire smoke and health of children and adolescents.Recent FindingsWe searched for studies available in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus from database inception up to October 11, 2022. Of 4926 studies initially identified, 59 studies from 14 countries were ultimately eligible. Over 33.3% of the studies were conducted in the USA, and two focused on multi-countries. The exposure assessment of wildfire smoke was heterogenous, with wildfire-specific particulate matters with diameters <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5, 22.0%) and all-source (22.0%) PM2.5 during wildfire period most frequently used. Over half of studies (50.6%) focused on respiratory-related morbidities/mortalities. Wildfire smoke exposure was consistently associated with enhanced risks of adverse health outcomes in children/adolescents. Meta-analysis results presented a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.12) for all-cause respiratory morbidity, 1.11 (95% Ci: 0.93-1.32) for asthma, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85-1.03) for bronchitis, and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.05-1.23) for upper respiratory infection, whilst - 21.71 g for birth weight (95% CI, - 32.92 to - 10.50) per 10 mu g/m3 increment in wildfire-specific PM2.5/all-source PM2.5 during wildfire event.SummaryThe majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with multiple adverse health outcomes among children and adolescents, with respiratory morbidities of significant concern. In-utero exposure to wildfire smoke may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes and have long-term impacts on height. Higher maternal baseline exposure to wildfire smoke and poor family-level baseline birthweight respectively elevated risks in preterm birth and low birth weight associated with wildfire smoke. More studies in low- and middle-income countries and focusing on extremely young children are needed. Despite technological progress, wildfire smoke exposure measurements remain uncertain, demanding improved methodologies to have more precise assessment of wildfire smoke levels and thus quantify the corresponding health impacts and guide public mitigation actions.";"Wildfire smoke; Air pollution; Children/adolescent health; Meta-analysis; Systematic reviews; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES; AIR-POLLUTION; FIRE SMOKE; HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; FOREST-FIRES; EXPOSURE; MORTALITY; ASSOCIATIONS; SYMPTOMS; OUTCOMES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Negative effects may also occur in the unborn, exposed to disaster stressors when critical organ systems are developing and when the consequences of exposure are large. Methods We exploit spatial and temporal variation in hurricane behaviour as a quasi-experimental design to assess whether fetal death is dose-responsive in the extent of hurricane damage. Data on births and fetal deaths are merged with Parish-level housing wreckage data. Fetal outcomes are regressed on housing wreckage adjusting for the maternal, fetal, placental and other risk factors. The average causal effect of maternal exposure to hurricane destruction is captured by difference-indifferences analyses. Results The adjusted odds of fetal death are 1.40 (1.07-1.83) and 2.37 (1.684-3.327) times higher in parishes suffering 10-50% and >50% wreckage to housing stock, respectively. For every 1% increase in the destruction of housing stock, we observe a 1.7% (1.1-2.4%) increase in fetal death. Of the 410 officially recorded fetal deaths in these parishes, between 117 and 205 may be attributable to hurricane destruction and postdisaster disorder. The estimated fetal death toll is 17.4-30.6% of the human death toll. Conclusions The destruction caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita imposed significant measurable losses in terms of fetal death.

This viewpoint is based on the experiences gained in Eritrea, a country that gained independence less than twenty years ago following a protracted war that left a trail of destruction of infrastructure in general and health facilities in particular. War that broke out with Ethiopia less than 10 years into its independence and border conflicts followed by a no peace no war stalemate situation aggravated by frequent droughts have continued to throttle economic recovery, reconstruction and rehabilitative efforts.

Southeast was the region with the highest increase in the odds of PTB (OR:1.41 (95%CI: 1.31-1.51) when the exposure occurred in the first trimester. In the North, exposure to PM2.5 & nbsp;during wildfire periods in the second trimester of pregnancy was associated with increased odds of PTB (OR:1.05 (95%CI: 1.01-1.09) in preterm birth when the exposure occurred in the second trimester. This study suggests that wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy may increase the risk for preterm birth in Brazil. This should be of great concern to the public health authorities, obstetricians, and policymakers.";"Wildfire; Smoke; Air pollution; Preterm birth; Pregnancy; AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; PREGNANCY OUTCOMES; HEALTH; MORTALITY; DEFECTS; GROWTH; RISK";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

This study aimed to examine effects of the Great East Japan Earthquake on perinatal outcomes using vital statistics of Japan. Methods: Birth registration data from vital statistics of Japan between March 2010 and March 2012 were used. Pregnant women who experienced the earthquake were categorized according to their gestational period as of March 11, 2011, as follows: gestational weeks 4-11, 12-19, 20-27, and 28-36 (2011 group). Similarly, pregnant women who did not experience the earthquake were categorized according to their gestational period as of March 11, 2010 and used as controls (2010 group). We also categorized prefectures as ""extremely affected"", ""moderately affected"", and ""slightly or unaffected"" regions. SSR, birth weight, and gestational period were compared between both groups. Results: The number of singleton births was 688 479 in the 2010 group and 679 131 in the 2011 group. In the extremely affected region, the SSR among women at 4-11 weeks of gestation was significantly lower in the 2011 group compared with the 2010 group (49.8% vs 52.1%, P = 0.009). In the extremely affected region, children born to women who experienced the earthquake at 28-36 weeks of gestation had significantly lower birth weights. Conclusions: The SSR declined among women who experienced the earthquake during early pregnancy, particularly in the extremely affected region.

Approximately 56.5% and 16% originated in the United States and Brazil, respectively, and fewer in other countries. Among the studies, wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy was assessed using distance of residence from wildfire-affected areas (n = 15), measurement of air pollutant concentration during wildfires (n = 11), number of wildfire records (n = 3), aerosol index (n = 1), and geographic hot spots (n = 1).

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a national policy mandating second-trimester cervical length screening by ultrasound, followed by vaginal progesterone treatment for short cervical length in comparison with no screening strategy. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a decision model comparing 2 strategies, namely (1) universal cervical length screening, and (2) no screening strategy. This study used the national delivery registry of Israel's Ministry of Health. All women diagnosed with a second-trimester cervical length <25 mm were treated with vaginal progesterone and were monitored with a bimonthly ultrasound scan for cervical dynamics and threat of early delivery. Preterm birth prevalence associated with short cervical length, the efficacy of progesterone in preterm birth prevention, and the accuracy of cervical length measurements were derived from previous studies. The cost of progesterone and bimonthly sonographic surveillance, low birthweight delivery, newborn admission to intensive care units, the first-year costs of managing preterm birth and low birthweight, and instances of handicaps and the cost of their follow-up were extracted from the publicly posted registry of Israel's Ministry of Health and Israel Social Securities data. Monte Carlo simulations decision tree mode, Tornado diagrams, and 1 and 2-way sensitivity analyses were implemented and the base case and sensitivity to parameters that were predicted to influence cost-effectiveness were calculated. RESULTS: Without cervical length screening, the discounted quality-adjusted life years were 30.179, and with universal cervical length screening, it increased to 30.198 (difference of 0.018 quality-adjusted life years). The average cost of no screening for cervical length strategy was $1047, and for universal cervical length screening, it was reduced to $998. The calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was -$2676 per quality-adjusted life year (dividing the difference in costs by the difference in quality-adjusted life years). Monte Carlo simulation of cervical length screening of 170,000 singleton newborns (rounded large number close to the number of singleton newborns in Israel) showed that 95.17% of all babies were delivered at gestational week >= 37 in comparison with 94.46% of babies with the no screening strategy. Given 170,000 singleton births, the national savings of screening for short cervical length when compared with no cervical length screening amounted to $8.31M annually, equating to $48.84 for a base case, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each case of low birthweight or very low birthweight avoided was -$14,718. A cervical length <25 mm was measured for 30,090 women, and of those, 24,650 were false positives. The major parameters that affected the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were the incidence of preterm birth, the specificity of cervical length measurements, and the efficacy of progesterone treatment. At a preterm birth incidence of <3%, universal screening does not lead to a cost saving. CONCLUSION: National universal cervical length screening should be incorporated into the routine anomaly scan in the second trimester, because it leads to a drop in the incidence of preterm birth and low birth weight babies in singleton pregnancies, thereby saving costs related to the newborn and gaining quality-adjusted life years.";"incremental cost-effectiveness ratios; low birth weight; pre-term birth; progesterone; quality-adjusted life year; short cervical length; Tornedo analysis; transabdominal ultrasound; transvaginal ultrasound; universal screening; very low birth weight; gestational age; Israel ministry of Health; health Management Organization; first year cost; PRETERM BIRTH; VAGINAL PROGESTERONE; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; RISK; RECOMMENDATIONS; OUTCOMES; HEALTH";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

METHODS: Using an institutional perinatal database from two hospitals in Houston, Texas, women with nonanomalous singletons delivering after 24 weeks of gestation between August 2011 and June 2018 were included. To evaluate the possible association of hurricane landfall with pregnancy outcomes, gravid women delivering within 280 days (40 weeks of gestation) on or after August 25, 2017 (the day of hurricane landfall) were categorized as exposed, and women who delivered before August 25, 2017, were the reference group. Composite maternal morbidity included any of the following: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, chorioamnionitis, endometritis, blood transfusion, peripartum hysterectomy, maternal critical care admission, pulmonary edema, or maternal death. Composite neonatal morbidity included any of the following: 5-minute Apgar score 3 or less, respiratory distress syndrome, use of ventilator or continuous positive airway pressure, suspected newborn sepsis, seizure, stillbirth, or neonatal death. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated after correcting for possible confounders identified on univariate analysis. Disruption in outcome trends were measured in time series analyses. RESULTS: Of 40,502 deliveries in our database, 29,179 (72%) met the inclusion criteria, with 3,842 (13.2%) delivering within 280 days of Hurricane Harvey landfall. Women delivering after Hurricane Harvey were on average less likely to be obese and more likely to be older, Caucasian, married, have a household income higher than $75,000, a high school education, and private insurance. However, compared with the cohort of gravid patients who delivered before Hurricane Harvey, composite maternal morbidity increased by 27% (11.5% vs 14.7%, aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.14-1.42) after the storm. Composite neonatal morbidity increased by 50% (7.8% vs 11.9%, aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.34-1.71). In time series analyses, we observed a significant shift in composite maternal morbidity specific to women of low socioeconomic status (estimate 2.87, P=.028).

Objective To evaluate the effect of earthquake occurred on February 27, 2010 and perinatal outcomes of Chilean pregnant women, and to examine these effects by timing of exposure during pregnancy and newborn gender. Methods A register-based study was performed using data collected from women who had a vaginal delivery in a large private health center in Santiago, Chile, during 2009 and 2010. The study population was categorized according to exposure to earthquake and timing during gestation. Primary perinatal outcomes were gestational age at birth, birth weight, length and head circumference. Analyses adjusted for gender, gestational age at exposure, parity, maternal age and income. Results A total of 1,966 eligible vaginal deliveries occurred during 2009 and 2,110 in 2010. Birth weight was not affected by the trimester of exposure; however, length, head circumference and gestational age at birth were significantly different according to trimester of exposure and gender of newborn. In multivariable analysis, newborns were shorter by 2 mm, 5 mm and 4.5 mm, if they were exposed during their first, second and third trimester, respectively. Furthermore, newborns had a smaller head circumference by 1.2 mm and 1.5 mm if they were exposed during first and second trimester of gestation. Conclusion In this cohort, exposure to the February 2010 earthquake resulted in earlier delivery and reduced length and head circumference in the offspring.

This study aimed to quantify the association between exposure to ambient biomass-attributable PM2.5 and the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth across pregnancy windows in Sydney, Australia, from 2010 to 2020. We conducted case-control studies nested within a cohort of 578,391 singleton pregnancies, including 29,954 preterm births and 2,928 stillbirths. Controls were randomly selected using risk-set sampling. Daily all-source PM2.5 estimates at a 5 km resolution were obtained from a previous study. Days exceeding the 95th percentile of all-source PM2.5 at statistical area level 4 without significant dust storm pollution were classified as biomass-affected days. For these days, biomass-attributable PM2.5 was estimated using the remainder component from a seasonal trend decomposition, with the seasonal and trend components representing nonbiomass-attributable PM2.5. Conditional logistic regressions were used to analyze associations between biomass-attributable PM2.5 exposure and outcomes, adjusting for area-level socioeconomic factors, temperature, humidity, and temporal and seasonal trends. The odds ratio for preterm birth per interquartile range increase in biomass-attributable PM2.5 was 1.002 (95% CI = 0.997, 1.007) for the entire pregnancy average exposure, with similar null results across trimesters. For stillbirth, the odds ratio was 1.002 (95% CI = 0.985, 1.019) for the entire pregnancy average exposure, with comparable null findings across trimesters.

We use millions of individual birth records to examine the effects of exposure to hurricanes during pregnancy, and the sensitivity of the estimates to these econometric problems. We find that exposure to a hurricane during pregnancy increases the probability of abnormal conditions of the newborn such as being on a ventilator more than 30 min and meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS).

METHODS: Birth weight data were obtained for 1999-2001 from the birth registration database of the Korean National Statis-tical Office and matched with the zip code and exposed/unexposed pregnancy week for days of the wildfires. Generalized linear models were then used to assess the associations between birth weight and exposure to wildfires after adjusting for fetal sex, gestational age, parity, maternal age, maternal education, paternal education, and average exposed atmospheric temperature. RESULTS: Compared with unexposed pregnancies before and after the wildfires, mean birth weight decreased by 41.4 g (95% confidence interval [CI],-72.4 to-10.4) after wildfire exposure during the first trimester, 23.2 g (95% CI,-59.3 to 13.0) for expo-sure during the second trimester, and 27.0 g (95% CI,-63.8 to 9.8) during the third trimester. In the adjusted model for infants exposed in utero during any trimester, the mean birth weight decreased by 32.5 g (95% CI,-53.2 to-11.7). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a 1% reduction in birth weight after wildfire exposure. Thus, exposure to by-products gener-ated during a wildfire disaster during pregnancy may slow fetal growth and cause developmental delays.";"Birth weight; Prenatal exposure; Trimester; Wildfire; Disaster; Korea; CARBON-MONOXIDE; FIRE; TOXICITY; SMOKE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Earthquakes can cause acute distress, but can also contribute to chronic stress through long-term disruptions to social, economic and domestic circumstances. The aims of this study were to examine the direct effect of earthquake experiences on the birthweight of infants of women who experienced the 2015 Nepal Earthquakes during pregnancy and whether mental health mediated this relationship. Methods This is a prospective, population-based cohort study. Pregnant women in Bhaktapur District, Nepal who had experienced the 2015 earthquakes after conception were recruited. Baseline data were collected in structured individual interviews. Follow up was a short telephone interview two weeks after the baby's birth. Infant birthweight recorded on the hospital-issued birth certificate. The direct effect of earthquake experiences on birthweight and the indirect effect via antenatal common mental disorders (CMDs) were tested using Sobel tests simultaneously. Results In total 497/498 women contributed baseline data and 469 (94.4%) women also provided the birth weight of their infants. In total 6% of infants had low birth weight (< 2.5 kg). The earthquake experiences did not have a significant direct effect on birthweight (p = 0.116). However, the effect of earthquake experiences had a significant indirect effect on infant birthweight via CMDs. When 15 covariates were controlled, women who had moderate to severe earthquake experiences had an increase of 1.58 scores of antenatal CMD symptoms that resulted in their babies being 20.50 g lighter than those who had low earthquake experiences (p = 0.026). Conclusions The findings from this study indicate that the relationship is mediated by the mental health of women during pregnancy. Data demonstrate that the mental health of women who are pregnant should be prioritised in post-disaster management not only because of the burden experienced by women but also because of the risk for the growth and development of their babies.";"Birthweight; Earthquake experiences; Antenatal; Common mental disorders; INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; PRETERM BIRTH; MATERNAL STRESS; DISORDERS; OUTCOMES; WOMEN; RISK; DEPRESSION; PREVALENCE; COUNTRIES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

This association has been attributed to excess death of males in gestation and to reduced conception of males. We attempt to empirically discriminate between these two attributions by testing the hypotheses that the attacks of September 11, 2001 were followed in California first by higher fetal death sex ratios and later by lower sex ratios among very low weight births and total live births. METHODS: We apply interrupted time-series methods to the fetal death, very low birth weight, and secondary sex ratios. The methods control for trends, seasonal cycles, and other forms of autocorrelation that could induce spurious associations. RESULTS: Findings support the excess death explanation in that the fetal death sex ratio reached its highest level in the 6 year test period in October and November of 2001, while the very low weight birth sex ratio dropped to its lowest level in 14 years in December of 2001. The secondary sex ratio exhibited its second lowest value in 14 years in December of 2001. No support was found for the reduced conception explanation in that the sex ratio did not differ from expected values 9, 10 or 11 months after the attacks. CONCLUSIONS: We infer support for the excess death explanation at the expense of the reduced conception explanation. We also describe the implications of our findings for public health planning.";"fetal death; population distress; September 11; sex ratio; very low birthweight; PRETERM BIRTH; EARTHQUAKE; HYPOTHESIS; DECLINE; EVENTS; STRESS; LENGTH; TIME";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

We investigated this association in the prospective nationwide US Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Cohort, focusing on prenatal wildfire PM2.5 exposure intensity, duration, and timing. Methods In this cohort analysis, we included live singleton births recorded in the ECHO Cohort with available data on gestational age at birth and birthweight and dates of conception between Jan 1, 2006, and March 20, 2020. Census tract-level estimates of daily mean wildfire-derived PM2.5 for the years 2006-20 from a previous machine learning model were linked to residential address history. We calculated the mean concentration of daily wildfire PM2.5, days with wildfire PM2.5 (>0, >= 2.5, >= 5.0, and >= 10.0 mu g/m(3); termed smoke days) and consecutive smoke days (2, 3, or >= 4 days; termed smoke waves) above the prespecified concentration thresholds across pregnancy. Associations of cumlative pregnancy wildfire PM2.5 exposure with preterm birth (delivery before 37 weeks of gestation) were analysed by adjusted pooled logistic regression in the nationwide ECHO sample and in the US West census region. Associations between smoke days in gestational weeks 0-35 and preterm birth were evaluated by logistic regression in the national sample. Findings We included 20 034 births from 30 ECHO Cohort study sites, with residences during pregnancy in all 48 contiguous US states and the District of Columbia. 1687 (8.4%) of the 20 034 infants were preterm. The mean daily wildfire PM2.5 concentration during pregnancy was 0.36 mu g/m(3) (SD 0.46), with exposure to a mean of 22.2 smoke days (SD 16.6) of any wildfire PM2.5 concentration (>0 mu g/m(3)). Estimates of association between wildfire PM2.5 exposure metrics and preterm birth included the null in nationwide analyses; whereas, in the US West sample (N=5807), we estimated increased odds of preterm birth associated with mean daily wildfire PM2.5 (odds ratio [OR] 1.139 per 1-mu g/m3 increase [95% CI 1.001-1.296]), exposure to smoke days with a wildfire PM2.5 concentration of 5.0 mu g/m(3) or greater (OR 1.018 per additional smoke day [1.003-1.032]) and 10.0 mu g/m(3) or greater (OR 1.030 [1.006-1.054]), and exposure to >= 4-day smoke waves of 5.0 mu g/m(3) or greater (OR 1.185 per additional smoke wave [1.044-1.347]) and 10.0 mu g/m(3) or greater (OR 1.232 [1.029-1.475]). At the national level, by week of gestation, associations with preterm birth were observed in mid-pregnancy for smoke days with wildfire PM2.5 concentrations above 0 mu g/m3, of 2.5 mu g/m(3) or greater, and of 5.0 mu g/m(3) or greater, and in late pregnancy for smoke days of 10.0 mu g/m(3) or greater. Interpretation In a prospective cohort, we observed increased odds of preterm birth associated with wildfire PM2.5 exposure in the western USA, with findings suggesting an exposure-response relationship for increasing exposure intensity and duration. Preterm birth was also associated with exposure to smoke days in mid-to-late pregnancy at the national level. For practice and policy, these findings support the need for public health interventions aimed at reducing exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy.

A comprehensive review is urgently needed to summarize and update the evidence on the health effects of cyclones. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to provide a systematic review with meta-analysis of current evidence on the risks of all reported health outcomes related to cyclones and to identify research gaps and make recommendations for further research. METHODS: We systematically searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies in English published before 21 December 2022. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guide-lines, we developed inclusion criteria, screened the literature, and included epidemiological studies with a quantitative risk assessment of any mortality or morbidity-related outcomes associated with cyclone exposures. We extracted key data and assessed study quality for these studies and applied meta-analyses to quantify the overall effect estimate and the heterogeneity of comparable studies. RESULTS: In total, 71 studies from eight countries (the United States, China, India, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Australia, Brazil), mostly the United States, were included in the review. These studies investigated the all-cause and cause-specific mortality, as well as morbidity related to injury, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, mental disorders, adverse birth outcomes, cancer, diabetes, and other outcomes (e.g., suicide rates, gender-based violence). Studies mostly included only one high-amplitude cyclone (cyclones with a Saffir-Simpson category of 4 or 5, i.e., Hurricanes Katrina or Sandy) and focused on mental disorders morbidity and all-cause mortality and hospitalizations. Consistently elevated risks of overall mental health morbidity, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as all-cause mortality or hospitalizations, were found to be associated with cyclones. However, the results for other outcomes were generally mixed or limited. A statistically significant overall relative risk of 1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.13], 1.18 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.25), 1.15 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.18), 1.26 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.50) was observed for all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalizations, respiratory disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospitalizations, respectively, after cyclone exposures, whereas no statistically significant risks were identified for diabetes mortality, heart disease mortality, and preterm birth. High between-study heterogeneity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: There is generally consistent evidence supporting the notion that high-amplitude cyclones could significantly increase risks of mental disorders, especially for PTSD, as well as mortality and hospitalizations, but the evidence for other health outcomes, such as chronic diseases (e.g., CVDs, cancer, diabetes), and adverse birth outcomes remains limited or inconsistent. More studies with rigorous exposure assessment, of larger spatial and temporal scales, and using advanced modeling strategy are warranted in the future, especially for those small cyclone-prone countries or regions with low and middle incomes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12158";"POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; HURRICANE-KATRINA; TROPICAL CYCLONES; MENTAL-HEALTH; INFECTIOUS DIARRHEA; PUBLICATION BIAS; TIME-SERIES; PUERTO-RICO; SHORT-TERM; MORTALITY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Data were obtained on pregnancy- and infant-related variables, housing, socioeconomic status, and access to health services, including food supplies, before and after the earthquake. Results Family income and mothers' education were lower in highly damaged areas. Among these women, underweight at first trimester of pregnancy was higher, and weight gain during the last trimester was lower, compared with low-damage regions. Preterm delivery was higher in low-damage areas. Birth indices of the infants were not significantly different between the 2 areas; however, in highly damaged areas, moderate malnutrition was more prevalent among children under 1 year (weight-for-age) and under 2 years (height-for-age). Conclusions Socioeconomic status of mothers was lower in highly damaged areas and might have played a role in their own and newborns' health status.

During pregnancy, disruptions in homeostasis may increase the likelihood of preterm birth and preeclampsia. Expectant mothers traditionally have high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders, and many are susceptible to a variety of stressors during pregnancy. These common life stressors include financial concerns and relationship challenges and may be exacerbated by the biological, social, and psychological changes occurring during pregnancy. In addition, external stressors such as major weather events (eg, hurricanes, tornados, floods) and other global phenomena (eg, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) may contribute to stress during pregnancy. This review investigates recent literature published about the use of nonpharmacologic modalities for stress relief in pregnancy and examines the interplay between psychiatric diagnoses and stressors, with the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of implementing nonpharmacologic interventions as sole therapies or in conjunction with psychotherapy or psychiatric medication therapy. Further, the effectiveness of each nonpharmacologic therapy in reducing symptoms of maternal stress is reviewed. Mindfulness meditation and biofeedback have shown effectiveness in improving one's mental health, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety.

Methods: Participants were interviewed regarding their hurricane experiences and perceived stress, and coping styles were assessed using the Brief COPE. Medical charts were also reviewed to obtain information about pregnancy outcomes. Logistic regression was performed to determine possible associations. Results: Hurricane exposure was significantly associated with induction of labor (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.03, 1.86], P =.03) and current perceived stress (aOR = 1.50, CI [1.34, 1.99], P <.01).

In order to investigate this relationship, data on every singleton birth in California 2006-2012 were combined with satellite-based estimates of wildfire smoke plume boundaries and high-resolution gridded estimates of surface PM2.5 concentrations and a regression model was used to estimate associations with preterm birth risk. Results suggest that each additional day of exposure to any wildfire smoke during pregnancy was associated with an 0.49 % (95 % CI: 0.41-0.59 %) increase in risk of preterm birth ( 37 weeks). At sample median smoke exposure (7 days) this translated to a 3.4 % increase in risk, relative to an unexposed mother. Estimates by trimester suggest stronger associations with exposure later in pregnancy and estimates by smoke intensity indicate that observed associations were driven by higher intensity smoke-days. Exposure to low intensity smoke-days had no association with preterm birth while an additional medium (smoke PM2.5 5-10 mu g/m(3)) or high (smoke PM2.5 10 mu g/m(3)) intensity smoke-day was associated with an 0.95 % (95 % CI: 0.47-1.42 %) and 0.82 % (95 % CI: 0.41-1.24 %) increase in preterm risk, respectively. In contrast to previous findings for other pollution types, neither exposure to smoke nor the relative impact of smoke on preterm birth differed by race/ethnicity or income in our sample. However, impacts differed greatly by baseline smoke exposure, with mothers in regions with infrequent smoke exposure experiencing substantially larger impacts from an additional smoke-day than mothers in regions where smoke is more common. We estimate 6,974 (95 % CI: 5,513-8,437) excess preterm births attributable to wildfire smoke exposure 2007-2012, accounting for 3.7 % of observed preterm births during this period.

We extend the previous literature by comparing the impact of the initial unexpected earthquake to the impacts of thousands of aftershocks that occurred in the same region over the 18 months following the initial earthquake. We find that exposure to these earthquakes reduced gestational age, increased the likelihood of having a late birth, and negatively affected newborn health-with the largest effects for earthquakes that occurred in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy. Our estimates are similar when we focus on just the impact of the initial earthquake or, in contrast, on all earthquakes controlling for endogenous location decisions using an instrumental variables approach.

This systematic review aims to synthesise the existing literature exploring the relationship between maternal exposure to short-to medium-term changes in outdoor air quality and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed articles using PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, ProQuest, GreenFILE and Scopus was conducted in January 2018 using selected search terms. Quality of included studies were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Results: Eleven studies were included; eight assessed the impact of maternal exposure to air pollution exacerbation events, such as wildfires, oil well fires and volcanic eruptions, and three assessed the impact of improvement events, such as the 2018 Beijing Olympics and closure of industrial activities, on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Studies were highly heterogenous in methodology. Six studies found a significant association between acute changes in air quality and markers of fetal growth restriction, while two did not. Three studies found an adverse association between acute changes in air quality and markers of gestational maturity, and one did not. Conclusion: Overall, there is some evidence that maternal exposure to acute changes in air quality of short-to medium-term duration increases the risk of fetal growth restriction and preterm birth.

Few studies simultaneously evaluated exposures to these increasingly common exposures. Objectives: We investigated the relationship between exposure to heat and wildfire smoke and preterm birth (PTB). Methods: In this time-stratified case-crossover study, participants consisted of 85,806 California singleton PTBs (20-36 gestational weeks) from May through October of 2015-2019. Birthing parent ZIP codes were linked to high-resolution daily weather, PM2.5 from wildfire smoke, and ambient air pollution data. Heat day was defined as a day with apparent temperature >98th percentile within each ZIP code and heat wave was defined as >= 2 consecutive heat days. Wildfire-smoke day was defined as a day with any exposure to wildfire-smoke PM2.5. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing exposures during a hazard period (lags 0-6) compared to control periods. Analyses were adjusted for relative humidity, fine particles, and ozone. Results: Wildfire-smoke days were associated with 3.0% increased odds of PTB (ORlag0: 1.03, CI: 1.00-1.05). Compared with white participants, associations appeared stronger among Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indians/Alaskan Native participants. Heatwave days (ORlag2: 1.07, CI: 1.02-1.13) were positively associated with PTB, with stronger associations among those simultaneously exposed to wildfire smoke days (ORlag2: 1.19, CI: 1.11-1.27). Similar findings were observed for heat days and when other temperature metrics (e.g., maximum, minimum) were used. Discussion: Heat and wildfire increased PTB risk with evidence of synergism.

Previous research suggests that short-term hospital admissions for respiratory outcomes increased specifically as a result of these fires. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the impact of a wildfire event during pregnancy on birth weight among term infants. METHODS: Using records for singleton term births delivered to mothers residing in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) during 2001-2005 (n = 886,034), we compared birth weights from pregnancies that took place entirely before or after the wildfire event (n = 747,590) with those where wildfires occurred during the first (n = 60,270), second (n = 39,435), or third (n = 38,739) trimester. The trimester-specific effects of wildfire exposure were estimated using a fixed-effects regression model with several maternal characteristics included as covariates. RESULTS: Compared with pregnancies before and after the wildfires, mean birth weight was estimated to be 7.0 g lower [95% confidence interval (CI): -11.8, -2.2] when the wildfire occurred during the third trimester, 9.7 g lower when it occurred during the second trimester (95% Cl: -14.5, -4.8), and 3.3 g lower when it occurred during the first trimester (95% Cl: -7.2, 0.6).

The city of New Orleans was under 8 to 12 feet of water. Memorial Medical Center, located in one of the lowest sections of the city, quickly became isolated from everyone and everything. The challenges that nurses faced during the 6 days after the disaster were arduous and multifaceted. Nurses had no choice but to be creative and flexible and improvise by using what limited resources were available. Nurses were not able to provide care in the typical patient care environment because patients were relocated to multiple areas of the hospital, the ER ramp, and the parking garage to await evacuation. The temperature soared to 110 degrees F, and evacuation efforts were chaotic and disorganized.

To date, there is no published literature available on the experiences of pregnant women in the USVI exposed to these hurricanes. Understanding how hurricanes affect pregnant women is key to developing and executing targeted hurricane preparedness and response policies. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of pregnancy and birth among women in the USVI exposed to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Methods: We employed a qualitative descriptive methodology to guide sampling, data collection, and analysis. Semi-structured interviews of 30-60 min in length were conducted with a purposive sample of women (N = 18) in the USVI who were pregnant during or became pregnant within two months after the hurricanes. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and data managed in MAXQDA. Team members developed a codebook, applied codes for content, and reconciled discrepancies. We thematically categorized text according to a socioecological conceptual framework of risk and resilience for maternal-neonatal health following hurricane exposure. Results: Women's experiences were organized into two main categories (risk and resilience). We identified the following themes related to risk at 3 socioecological levels including: (1) individual: changes in food access (We had to go without) and stress (I was supposed to be relaxing); (2) household/community: diminished psychosocial support (Everyone was dealing with their own things) and the presence of physical/environmental hazards (I was really scared); and (3) maternity system: compromised care capacity (The hospital was condemned). The themes related to resilience included: (1) individual: personal coping strategies (Being calm); (2) household/community: mutual psychosocial and tangible support (We shared our resources); and (3) the maternity system: continuity of high-quality care (On top of their game). Conclusions: A socioecological approach provides a useful framework to understand how risk and resilience influence the experience of maternal hurricane exposure. As the frequency of the most intense hurricanes is expected to increase, clinicians, governments, and health systems should work collaboratively to implement hurricane preparedness and response plans that address pregnant women's unique needs and promote optimal maternal-infant health.";"Cyclone; Disaster; Pregnancy; Pregnancy outcome; Resilience; Risk; US Virgin Islands; DISASTER RECOVERY; BIRTH OUTCOMES; EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS; MATERNAL EXPOSURE; RESILIENCE; INTERVIEWS; STRESS; RECALL; PLACE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The population of adult animals peaked in 1991 but decreased rapidly during the subsequent drought and immediate postdrought years. In the 1992 birth season (and second year of the drought) infant mortality reached 80%, and 20.8% of all adult females in the reserve died. The following year adult female mortality reached a high of 29.9%. Juvenile mortality in 3 intensively studied groups was 57% during the second year of the drought. We compare these data with infant, juvenile, and adult female mortality in non-drought years. We are not able to calculate adult male mortality, as they often emigrate from the reserve to the adjacent forest; however in the same 3 intensively studied groups, 89% of the males disappeared during the 2 immediate postdrought years. By 1996 the population had begun to recover after the decline that correlated with the drought conditions. Annual reproduction, high birth rates (.80-.86 annually), early sexual maturity and dietary adaptability may be contributing factors to the recovery.

Therefore, this study investigated the impact of the GEJE in the Fukushima Prefecture on spontaneous and induced abortions with regard to seasonal variability.Methods: We used the data of vital statistics of live birth and stillbirth registry and the census survey of the Fukushima Maternity Care Facility. We calculated the spontaneous and induced abortion rate for 2011-2016 using two different methods (cross-sectional and longitudinal). We calculated the quartiles and outliers to determine the impact and duration of the GEJE. Periodicity was investigated using spectral density analysis. The data were analyzed for the entire Fukushima Prefecture and by region.Results: The spontaneous abortion rate did not show specific changes after the GEJE. Contrarily, the monthly analysis in the cross-sectional method, revealed specific increases in induced abortion rate during the year after the GEJE; in the longitudinal method, induced abortions increased among women who became pregnant within 1 year after the GEJE. Spontaneous abortion showed no specific periodicity, while induced abortion showed cycles of 6 and 12 months, with a particular increase in May each year.Conclusions: The spontaneous abortion rate was not affected by the GEJE. The changes in the induced abortion rate after the disaster may have overlapped with the timing of the increased periodicity, and cannot be attributed solely to the GEJE.";"disasters; induced abortion; periodicity; pregnant; spontaneous abortion; ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY; ETHICS COMMITTEE; RISK-FACTORS; MISCARRIAGE; 1ST-TRIMESTER; SEASONALITY; OBSTETRICS; EXPECTANT; OUTCOMES; SOCIETY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

However, the impact of TCs on pregnant women, a vulnerable population, remains largely unknown. We aimed to estimate the association between prenatal exposure to TCs and risk of preterm birth in the eastern United States (US) and to assess whether the association varies by individual- and area-level characteristics. Methods: We included data on 19,529,748 spontaneous singleton births from 1989 to 2002 across 378 US counties. In each county, we classified days as exposed to a TC when TC-associated peak sustained winds at the county's population-weighted center were > 17.2 m/s (gale-force winds or greater). We defined preterm birth as births delivered prior to 37 completed weeks of gestation. We used distributed lag log-linear mixed-effects models to estimate the relative risk (RR) and absolute risk difference (ARD) for TC exposure by comparing preterm births occurring in TC-periods (from 2 days before to 30 days after the TC's closest approach to the county's population center) to matched non-TC periods. We conducted secondary analyses using other wind thresholds (12 m/s and 22 m/s) and other exposure metrics: county distance to storm track (30 km, 60 km, and 100 km) and cumulative rainfall within the county (75 mm, 100 mm, and 125 mm). Results: During the study period, there were 1,981,797 (10.1%) preterm births and 58 TCs that affected at least one US county on which we had birth data. The risk of preterm birth was positively associated with TC exposure defined as peak sustained wind speed > 17.2 m/s (gale-force winds or greater) [RR: 1.01 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.03); ARD: 9 (95% CI: -7, 25) per 10,000 pregnancies], distance to storm track < 60 km [RR: 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.04); ARD: 23 (95% CI: 9, 38) per 10,000 pregnancies], and cumulative rainfall > 100 mm [RR: 1.04 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.06); ARD: 36 (95% CI: 16, 56) per 10,000 pregnancies]. Results were comparable when considering other wind, distance, or rain thresholds. The association was more pronounced among early preterm births and mothers living in more socially vulnerable counties but did not vary across strata of other hypothesized risk factors. Conclusions: Maternal exposure to TC was associated with a higher risk of preterm birth.

It is unclear to what extent PNMS influences obesity risk independent of its impact on birth characteristics, especially among humans. Our objective was to determine whether PNMS resulting from a natural disaster influenced risk of childhood obesity. RESULTS: Eight children with high objective PNMS exposure (14.5%) were obese compared to one child (1.8%) with low exposure (P = 0.02). Objective PNMS increased obesity risk (model 1, P = 0.02, odds ratio = 1.37) after controlling for other potential risk factors. DISCUSSION: Results suggest that PNMS might be an independent risk factor in the development of childhood obesity. METHODS: Participants included 111 women who were pregnant during the January 1998 Quebec Ice Storm or who conceived within the following 3 months and their children. We tested associations between objective and subjective PNMS from the storm and childhood obesity status at age 51/2, controlling for children's birth characteristics and breastfeeding status; household socioeconomic status; maternal obstetric complications, life events and smoking during pregnancy, psychological functioning, and height (model 1, n = 111) or BMI (for a subset of 69 participants, model 2).";"PITUITARY-ADRENAL-AXIS; MATERNAL STRESS; HEALTH OUTCOMES; LIPID PROFILES; BIRTH-WEIGHT; LIFE; FAMINE; GROWTH; AGE; IMPACT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

However, the mechanism and exposure timing of this association are poorly understood. Objective: We estimate the association of wildfire smoke on PTB phenotypes (spontaneous PTB [sPTB] and medically indicated PTB [mPTB]) as well as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). Study design: Birth cohort data from singleton livebirths in California from 2007 to 2012 were combined with daily zip code-level estimates of wildfire smoke intensity. Satellite-based estimates of wildfire smoke plume boundaries and high-resolution gridded estimates of surface particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) concentrations were used to calculate smoke exposure from 4 weeks preconception through gestational week 20. The two primary exposures were (1) wildfire smoke exposure at distinct gestational ages and (2) concentration of wildfire smoke exposure. Logistic regression models assessed associations between the number of wildfire smoke-exposed days and PTB phenotypes. HDP were also assessed as an outcome, given their major contribution to mPTB. Four primary outcomes were used: (1) overall PTB (<37 weeks), (2) sPTB, (3) mPTB, and (4) HDP. Results: Of 2,548,347 eligible pregnant individuals, 86% were exposed to at least 1 day of wildfire smoke of any PM2.5 intensity during the exposure period. Wildfire smoke of any intensity was significantly associated with sPTB during the exposure period (odds ratios [OR] [95% confidence intervals (CI)]: 1.003 [1.0021, 1.0039]). Each additional day of smoke exposure conferred 0.3% increased odds of sPTB. We did not observe an association of wildfire smoke with HDP. Only smoke exposure of any intensity between 14 and 20 weeks was associated with increased odds of mPTB OR CI (95%) (1.0038 [1.0008, 1.0069]). Wildfire smoke exposure of any intensity in the gestational period of smoke exposure was associated in increased odds of all PTB, except for the preconception period. Conclusions: Our study found an association of wildfire smoke exposure with PTB, which was largely driven by sPTB.";"Wildfire smoke; Pregnancy; Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; Reproductive health; Environmental health; PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

In September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the archipelago, which caused: collapse of the electrical system, collapse of the communication system, limited access to clean water, food, gas, and health services, destruction of public (e.g., hospitals) and private property (e.g., houses) and more than 4500 deaths. Pregnant and postpartum individuals are especially vulnerable to natural disasters. They face difficulty obtaining adequate pre- and post-natal care, are exposed to increased risk of miscarriage, premature delivery, and giving birth to low birth weight babies during and after disasters and are also more likely to suffer physical and mental health problems compared to the general population during and after disasters. A face-to-face questionnaire was administered to PROTECT participants who were pregnant during hurricanes Irma or Maria or who became pregnant shortly after in order to identify hurricane-related sources of stress and other adverse effects. This paper is based on the answers to the open-ended question at the end of the questionnaire where participants were asked to share their experiences during and after the hurricanes. Among the 375 participants who completed the survey, 76 answers to the open-ended question were considered due to data saturation. The answers to the open-ended question were transcribed into a document in order to facilitate the coding process. The transcribed text was analyzed first to identify emerging categories and then coded to identify common themes as well as divergence among participants. The following themes were identified: pregnancy and birth challenges, lack of access to basic services, housing conditions, stressful working conditions, concerns about health, concerns about their children, and positive or protective aspects. The results indicate how the disruption in access to basic services has a unique impact on the physical and mental health of pregnant and post-partum women in an emergency situation. These findings point to the potential benefit of developing specific protocols designed for emergency preparedness aimed at this population, which can inform healthcare providers and community organizations in case of future events.";"maternal health; emergencies; hurricanes; Puerto Rico; EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS; WOMEN";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

We find that women who were exposed to drought conditions during their early childhood are significantly less wealthy as adults. These effects are confined to women born and raised in rural households, indicating that the impacts of rainfall are felt via changes in agricultural output. In addition to lower levels of wealth, women who experience droughts in infancy also receive fewer years of formal education and, in the case of extreme drought conditions, have reduced adult heights. Our results also suggest that drought exposure in infancy can have long-term, negative impacts on women's empowerment. Finally, we also show that these impacts may be transmitted to the women's offspring, with children of affected women more likely to be born at a low birth weight (weighing <2.5 kg). To our knowledge, this represents the largest study to date both geographically and over time showing a strong relationship between early life rainfall conditions and adult outcomes, and the first to show that the impacts could span generations.

Features unique to the obstetric population (including antepartum, intrapartum, postpartum and neonatal care) warrant special consideration in the event of a disaster. Pregnancy increases the risks of untoward outcomes from various infectious diseases. Trauma during pregnancy presents anatomic and physiologic considerations that often can require increased use of resources such as higher rates of cesarean delivery. Recent evidence suggests that floods and human-influenced environmental disasters increase the risks of spontaneous miscarriages, preterm births, and low-birth-weight infants among pregnant women. The potential surge in maternal and neonatal patient volume due to mass-casualty events, transfer of high-acuity patients, or redirection of patients because of geographic barriers presents unique challenges for obstetric care facilities. These circumstances require that facilities plan for additional increases in necessary resources and staffing. Although emergencies may be unexpected, hospitals and obstetric delivery units can prepare to implement plans that will best serve maternal and pediatric care needs when disasters occur. Clear designation of levels of maternal and neonatal care facilities, along with establishment of a regional network incorporating hospitals that provide maternity services and those that do not, will enable rapid transport of obstetric patients to the appropriate facilities, ensuring the right care at the right time.

Methods: In this health care setting in Kathmandu, Nepal routine blood culture is performed on all febrile patients with a temperature >38 degrees C or when there is clinical suspicion of bacteremia. During 2015 we atypically isolated and identified several Serratia spp. We extracted clinical data from these cases and performed whole genome sequencing on all isolates using a MiSeq system (Ilumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Results: Between June and November 2015, we identified eight patients with suspected bacteremia that produced a positive blood culture for Serratia spp., six Serratia rubidaea and five Serratia marcescens. The S. rubidaea were isolated from three neonates and were concentrated in the neonatal intensive care unit between June and July 2015. ALL patients were severely ill and one patient died. Whole genome sequencing confirmed that six Nepalese S. rubidaea sequences were identical and indicative of a single-source outbreak. Conclusions: Despite extensive screening we were unable to identify the source of the outbreak, but the inferred timeline suggested that these atypical infections were associated with the aftermath of two massive earthquakes. We speculate that deficits in hygienic behavior, combined with a Lack of standard infection control, in the post-earthquake emergency situation contributed to these unusual Serratia spp. outbreaks.";"bloodstream infections; natural disaster infection outbreak; Serratia marcescens; Serratia rubidaea; Serratia spp.; INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; IMMUNOCOMPETENT ADULT; INFECTION; EVOLUTION; PATHOGEN";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence on the impact of climate change on child health, using the evidence gap map (EGM) to address knowledge gaps and establish a foundation for evidence-based interventions and future research.Method From inception, academic databases (such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, CINAHL and Scopus) and grey literature were systematically searched. We included climate change-related studies involving children aged 0-5 worldwide. Covidence facilitated a rigorous screening process, and we conducted a critical appraisal. Two independent reviewers handled screening and data extraction. Eligible studies underwent coding and extraction using Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (EPPI) reviewer software. The EGM was constructed using EPPI Mapper, and comprehensive findings were presented through live links and figures.Result We identified 196 studies, comprising 59.2% children and 40.8% neonates, with diverse research approaches, including 94% quantitative studies. There has been a notable increase in research publications over the past 5 years. Evidence is heavily concentrated in Asia (93 studies) and Africa (47 studies). The most frequently studied exposures are those related to extreme climate events, followed by drought and floods. However, there are gaps in the study of extreme cold and storms. The significant outcomes comprised preterm birth (55 studies), low birth weight (27 studies), malnutrition (59 studies) and diarrhoeal diseases (28 studies). Evidence on mental health problems and congenital disabilities receives relatively less attention.Conclusion This EGM is crucial for researchers, policymakers and practitioners. It highlights knowledge gaps and guides future research to address the evolving threats of climate change to global child health.Trial registration number INPLASY202370086";"Child Health; Infant; Neonatology; Mortality; Epidemiology; HEALTH; STRATEGIES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Particulate matter less than 2.5 mu ms (PM2.5) is among the major pollutants emitted in wildfire smoke. Previous studies found PM2.5 associated with lower birthweight, however, the relationship between wildfire-specific PM2.5 and birthweight is uncertain. Our study of 7923 singleton births in San Francisco between January 1, 2017 and March 12, 2020 examines associations between wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy and birthweight. We linked daily estimates of wildfire-specific PM2.5 to maternal residence at the ZIP code level. We used linear and log-binomial regression to examine the relationship between wildfire smoke exposure by trimester and birthweight and adjusted for gestational age, maternal age, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment. We stratified by infant sex to examine potential effect modification. Exposure to wildfire-specific PM2.5 during the second trimester of pregnancy was positively associated with increased risk of large for gestational age (OR = 1.13; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.24), as was the number of days of wildfire-specific PM2.5 above 5 mu g m(-3) in the second trimester (OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.06). We found consistent results with wildfire smoke exposure in the second trimester and increased continuous birthweight-for-gestational age z-score. Differences by infant sex were not consistent. Counter to our hypothesis, results suggest that wildfire smoke exposures are associated with increased risk for higher birthweight. We observed strongest associations during the second trimester. These investigations should be expanded to other populations exposed to wildfire smoke and aim to identify vulnerable communities. Additional research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms in this relationship between wildfire smoke exposure and adverse birth outcomes.";"wildfires; PM2.5; pregnancy; birth weight; fetal growth; AMBIENT PM2.5; PREGNANCY; SEX";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The ever-increasing range of biocompatible nanoparticle formulations available is now making it possible to selectively deliver drugs to uterine and placental tissues and dramatically limit fetal drug transfer. Formulations that are refractory to placental uptake offer the possibility of retaining drugs within the maternal circulation, allowing pregnant individuals to take medicines previously considered too harmful to the developing baby. Liposomes, ionizable lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, and adenoviral vectors have all been used to create efficacious drug delivery systems for use in pregnancy, although each approach offers distinct advantages and limitations.

Reducing maternal mortality and morbidity is currently the main targets of the UN's Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3. The purpose of this study was to develop an intervention package called RHCC (Reproductive Health Kit 8; Capacity building; Community awareness), and to implement and evaluate it in three primary health-care (PHC) facilities in Belkuchi, Bangladesh, in order to improve the quality and availability of post-abortion care (PAC) during the 2017 floods. Design/methodology/approach This research used both quantitative and qualitative methods to develop, implement and assess the RHCC in three flood-prone PHC facilities in Belkuchi. Findings The RHCC was implemented during the floods of 2017. The findings pre- and post-intervention suggest it led to an increase in skilled management among health workers, an increase in the quality of care for clients and the availability of PAC at three PHC facilities during floods. Originality/value Due to its geographic location, Bangladesh is exposed to recurrent floods and cyclones. Evidence-based integrated intervention packages, such as the RHCC, can improve the quality and availability of reproductive health care during disasters at PHC level and, in doing so, can promote the UN's agenda on ""disaster resilient health system"" to achieve the SDG 3, and the WHO's campaign on universal health coverage.";"Bangladesh; Flood; Sendai framework; Universal health coverage; SDG; Sexual and reproductive health; PHC; Post-abortion care; MENSTRUAL REGULATION; SERVICES; CALL";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

A growing body of evidence demonstrated associations between air pollution exposure during pregnancy and birth defects. To date, there is no study looking at birth defects and exposure to wildfire-related air pollution, which is suggested as a type of air pollution source with high toxicity for reproductive health. Objective Our study addresses this gap by examining the association between birth defects and wildfire smoke exposure in Brazil between 2001 and 2018. Based on known differences of impacts of wildfires across different regions of Brazil, we hypothesized differences in risks of birth defects for different regions. Methods We used a logistic regression model to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for individual birth defects (12 categories) associated with wildfire exposure during each trimester of pregnancy. Results Among the 16,825,497 birth records in our study population, there were a total of 7595 infants born in Brazil between 2001 and 2018 with birth defects in any of the selected categories. After adjusting for several confounders in the primary analysis, we found statistically significant OR for three birth defects, including cleft lip/cleft palate [OR: 1.007 (95% CI: 1.001; 1.013)] during the second trimester of exposure, congenital anomalies of the respiratory system [OR: 1.013 (95% CI: 1.002; 1.023)] in the second trimester of exposure, and congenital anomalies of the nervous system [OR: 1.002 (95% CI: 1.001; 1.003)] during the first trimester of exposure for the regions South, North, and Midwest, respectively. Significance Our results suggest that maternal exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of an infant being born with some congenital anomaly. Considering that birth defects are associated with long-term disability, impacting families and the healthcare system (e.g., healthcare costs), our findings should be of great concern to the public health community. Impact statement Our study focused on the association between maternal exposure to wildfire smoke in Brazil during pregnancy and the risk of an infant being born with congenital anomalies, which presents serious public health and environmental challenges.";"Wildfire; Smoke; Air pollution; Birth defects; Pregnancy; MATERNAL EXPOSURE; PREGNANCY OUTCOMES; MORTALITY; QUALITY; IMPACTS; GROWTH; COHORT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The purpose is twofold: (i) to capture disaggregated vulnerability variations normally obscured by national statistics, thereby providing more nuanced insights into Vietnam's vulnerability to natural disasters; and (ii) to take advantage of the fact that the overall political system and key institutional structures to a large extent are constant across Vietnam's provinces, which makes the analysis a novel addition to the many disaster studies based on cross-national variations. The paper's analysis indicates that much of Vietnam's cross-provincial variations in natural disaster fatalities and economic costs can be explained by differences in key socioeconomic factors. High provincial rates of inequality, poverty and infant mortality, for instance, appear to drive up natural disaster fatalities.

These programmed changes may be the origins of adult diseases, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. Throughout evolution and development, humans and animals have been exposed to two common environmental stresses, drought and famine. Notably, drought-induced water deprivation is associated with dehydration anorexia and thus a concomitant potential nutrient stress. Our laboratory has performed studies among pregnant rat and sheep in which we simulate drought conditions via maternal dehydration and famine conditions via nutrient restriction. Maternal dehydration results in low-birth-weight offspring, which demonstrate gender-specific plasma hypernatremia and hypertonicity and arterial hypertension. Gestational nutrient restriction also resulted in low-birth-weight offspring. If permitted rapid catch-up growth by nutrient availability, these offspring demonstrate evidence of increased body weight and body fat, and leptin resistance as adults. Conversely, if the catch-up growth is delayed by nutrition restriction, the offspring exhibit normal body weight, body fat, and plasma leptin levels as adults. These studies indicate that osmoregulatory and cardiovascular homeostasis and phenotypic predisposition to obesity may be programmed in utero.

Objectives: Our goal was to determine how timing and severity of exposure during pregnancy to objective and subjective stress due to a natural disaster influenced gestation length and fetal growth patterns. Methods: We assessed objective and subjective PNMS levels among 172 women exposed to an ice storm during or shortly before pregnancy. We analyzed associations between PNMS levels and outcomes (gestation length, birth weight, birth length, head circumference, and growth ratios), controlling for other variables such as age, obstetric complications, socioeconomic status, and trait anxiety. Results: Gestation lengths and predicted birth weights were shorter among participants exposed to the ice storm during early to mid pregnancy, compared to 3 rd trimester and pre-pregnancy exposure. Birth lengths were shorter in the sample compared to population references, and predicted values were shorter among participants with a ""discrepancy"" between their objective and subjective PNMS levels. High objective PNMS levels predicted smaller head circumferences in early pregnancy, but we also observed patterns in predicted values of head circumference to birth length ratios suggesting the sparing of brain development relative to birth length among boys in early pregnancy. These sparing effects decreased in later pregnancy. Conclusions: Exposure to stressful events during pregnancy influences birth outcomes independently of other factors. Exposure timing, newborn sex, and the type of stressor influence the effects observed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the current evidence is scarce, inconsistent, and has knowledge gaps. This study aims to estimate the associations of flood exposure before and during pregnancy with adverse birth outcomes and to identify susceptible exposure windows and effect modifiers. Methods In this cohort study, we obtained all the birth records occurring in Greater Sydney, Australia, from Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2020, from the New South Wales Midwives Data Collection and in the Brisbane metropolitan region, Australia, from Jan 1, 1995, to Dec 31, 2014, from the Queensland Health Perinatal Data Collection. For each birth, residential address and historical flood information from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory were used to estimate the numbers of days with floods during five exposure windows (Pre-1 was defined as 13-24 weeks before the last menstrual period [LMP], Pre-2 was 0-12 weeks before the LMP, trimester 1 [Tri-1] was 0-12 weeks after the LMP, trimester 2 [Tri-2] was 13-28 weeks after the LMP, and trimester 3 [Tri-3] was >= 29 weeks after the LMP). We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) of adverse birth outcomes (preterm births, stillbirths, term low birthweight [TLBW], and small for gestational age [SGA]) associated with flood exposures in the five exposure windows using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Findings 1 338 314 birth records were included in our analyses, which included 91 851 (6<middle dot>9%) preterm births, 9831 (0<middle dot>7%) stillbirths, 25 567 (1<middle dot>9%) TLBW, and 108 658 (8<middle dot>1%) SGA. Flood exposure in Pre-1 was associated with increased risks of TLBW (HR 1<middle dot>06 [95% CI 1<middle dot>01-1<middle dot>12]) and SGA (1<middle dot>04 [1<middle dot>01-1<middle dot>06]); flood exposure during Tri-1 was associated with increased risks of preterm births (1<middle dot>03 [1<middle dot>002-1<middle dot>05]), stillbirth (1<middle dot>11 [1<middle dot>03-1<middle dot>20]), and SGA (1<middle dot>03 [1<middle dot>01-1<middle dot>06]). In contrast, flood exposures during Pre-2 and Tri-3 were associated with reduced risks. Interpretation Exposures to floods in Pre-1 and Tri-1 are both associated with increased risks of adverse birth outcomes, and the risks increase with a higher exposure.

METHODS: Case-control study, carried out with live births at the Municipal Hospital of Governador Valadares, from May 2017 to July 2018. The case group consisted of full-term live births and low birthweight, and the control group consisted of full-term live births with adequate weight, matched by gender and date of birth. For each case, two controls were selected. Data collection was performed through interviews with the puerperal women, and complementary information was obtained by analyzing the prenatal card and medical records. For data analysis, logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: The study included 65 live births from the case group and 130 from the control group. After the analysis was adjusted for other factors under study, we found that the higher risks of low birthweight are associated with the first childbirth (OR = 2.033; 95%CI = 1.047-3.948; p = 0.036), smoking during pregnancy (OR = 2.850; 95%CI = 1.013-8.021; p = 0.047) and consumption of water supplied by the municipalities affected by the tailings from the Fundao dam failure (RC = 2.444; 95%CI = 1.203-4.965; p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The variables ""water consumed during pregnancy,"" ""previous pregnancies"" and ""maternal smoking"" were associated with low birthweight in the population studied. The importance of epidemiological studies that assess water quality and its adverse health effects is reinforced, as well as greater prenatal control of first-time pregnant women and greater support of policies against smoking, especially during pregnancy.

Presently, India is facing a dual burden of natural disasters and malnutrition, especially in the vulnerable regions that are exposed to floods. Many studies have been focused on micro-level or regional-level analyses. The present study is uniquely examining the association between flood exposure and malnutrition at a national scale. The study investigated the impacts of flood exposure on childhood malnutrition, using the Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure (CIAF) to assess stunting, wasting, and underweight among children under five years age group. The present study is based on the analyses of data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5, 2019-2021) and Central Water Commission (CWC) reports. The data were analyzed across flood-affected regions in India and categorized by the frequency of flood events (i.e., non-flooded; 1-2 times flooded; and three times flooded events). The analysis reveals a significant increase in malnutrition rates with higher flood exposure in regions experiencing three flood events, 38 percent of children were stunted, 20 percent were wasted, and 35.7 percent were underweight as compared to non-flooded areas. Factors such as low birth weight, maternal education, sanitation facilities, and household infrastructure intensified malnutrition outcomes. The major findings of the study suggested that repeated flooding events aggravate food insecurity and increase vulnerability to child malnutrition. This study not only highlights the compounded effects of flood exposure and socio-economic disparities on CIAF malnutrition but also offers policy-relevant insights. The results of the study highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions, including developing disaster-resilient infrastructure, educational programs for mothers, and enhanced access to sanitation and healthcare in flood-affected regions in India.";"Flood; CIAF; Malnutrition; Stunting; Maternal education; India; HEALTH OUTCOMES; AFFECTED AREAS; GLOBAL HEALTH; CHILDREN; UNDERNUTRITION; BANGLADESH; NUTRITION; INEQUALITY; PAKISTAN; POVERTY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Earthquakes have been associated with increased risks of preterm birth (PTB) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, the literature on this subject is scarce. Maternal antenatal stress has been suggested as the link between earthquakes and PTB. In this study the Christchurch earthquake was utilised as a model of maternal stress to assess its effects on PTB rates and other pregnancy outcomes. Aim To investigate whether women who experienced a major earthquake during the first trimester of pregnancy were at an altered risk of PTB compared to women who did not experience an earthquake during their pregnancy. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study. Women carrying a singleton pregnancy in their first trimester on 22 February, 2011 were identified for a post-earthquake cohort (n = 1057). A group of women pregnant in 2009 were identified for a pre-earthquake cohort (n = 1314). Data were obtained from electronic medical records and the hospital clinical coding database. Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to analyse differences in pregnancy outcomes. Statistically significant variables together with earthquake exposure were assessed as risk factors for PTB using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results No significant difference in the rate of PTB was found between the two groups P > 0.05). Conclusion Women carrying a singleton pregnancy in this study who experienced a major earthquake in their first trimester do not seem to be at an increased risk of PTB.";"earthquake; first trimester; pregnancy; preterm birth; stress; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; MATERNAL STRESS; GESTATIONAL-AGE; FETAL MEMBRANES; PRENATAL STRESS; OUTCOMES; DISASTERS; CORTISOL; DELIVERY; HEALTH";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Using results from the Fukushima Health Management Survey, Soso District (the affected area where the damaged nuclear power plant is located) and Aizu District (a less-affected area located farthest from the plant) were compared. In this study, newborn and maternal background characteristics were examined, as well as feeding methods, and other factors for newborn growth at the first postpartum examination for 1706 newborns born after the disaster in the affected (n = 836) and less-affected (n = 870) areas. Postpartum examinations took place 1 month after birth. Feeding method trends were examined, and multivariate regression analyses were used to investigate effects on newborn mass gain. There were no significant differences in background characteristics among newborns in these areas. When birth dates were divided into four periods to assess trends, no significant change in the exclusive breastfeeding rate was found, while the exclusive formula-feeding rate was significantly different across time periods in the affected area (p = 0.02). Multivariate analyses revealed no significant independent associations of maternal depression and change in medical facilities (possible disaster effects) with other newborn growth factors in either area. No area differences in newborn growth at the first postpartum examination or in exclusive breastfeeding rates were found during any period. Exclusive formula-feeding rates varied across time periods in the affected, but not in the less-affected area. It is concluded that effective guidance to promote breast-feeding and prevent exclusive use of formula is important for women in post-disaster circumstances.";"Natural disasters; Environmental disasters; Pregnancy; Maternal stress; Breastfeeding; Formula feeding; Growth status; YOUNG-CHILDREN; BIRTH-WEIGHT; WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; SEX-RATIO; DISASTER; INFANTS; ATTACKS; TSUNAMI; MALNUTRITION; MORTALITY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

This special issue summarizes the results and current status of the FHMS and discusses the challenges and future directions of the FHMS. The FHMS, a cohort study of all people who were residents in Fukushima Prefecture at the time of the accident, consists of a Basic Survey, Thyroid Ultrasound Examination, Comprehensive Health Check, Mental Health and Lifestyle Survey, and Pregnancy and Birth Survey. The radiation exposure was estimated based on the behavioral records examined using the Basic Survey. Although the response rate was low in the Basic Survey, the representativeness of the radiation exposure data was confirmed using additional surveys. There appears to be no relationship between the radiation exposure and risk of thyroid cancer, although more thyroid cancer cases were detected than initially expected. The ongoing Comprehensive Health Check and Mental Health and Lifestyle Survey have provided evidence of worsening physical and mental health status. The Pregnancy and Birth Survey showed rates of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and congenital abnormalities similar to the national average. Considering the above evidence, the Fukushima Prefectural Government decided to end the Pregnancy and Birth Survey at the end of March 2021, as recommended by the Prefectural Oversight Committee. The framework of the FHMS has not changed, but the FHMS needs to adapt according to the survey results and the changing needs of the eligible residents and municipalities.";"protocol; cohort study; radiation; disaster; thyroid gland; EAST JAPAN EARTHQUAKE; NUCLEAR DISASTER; RISK-FACTORS; DRINKING; EVACUEES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The objective of this study is to summarize the literature on cardiovascular and metabolic, respiratory, allergic, and neuropsychological health outcomes, from prenatal development through early childhood, associated with early-life exposures to outdoor air pollutants, including traffic-related and wildfire-generated air pollutants. (2) Methods: We conducted a search using PubMed and the references of articles previously known to the authors. We selected papers that investigated health outcomes during fetal or childhood development in association with early-life ambient or source-specific air pollution exposure. (3) Results: The current literature reports that prenatal and early-childhood exposures to ambient and traffic-related air pollutants are associated with a range of adverse outcomes in early life, including cardiovascular and metabolic, respiratory and allergic, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Very few studies have investigated associations between wildfire-related air pollution exposure and health outcomes during prenatal, postnatal, or childhood development. (4) Conclusion: Evidence from January 2000 to January 2022 supports a role for prenatal and early-childhood air pollution exposures adversely affecting health outcomes during development.

Ten reports of low-to-moderate risk of methodological bias were included. There was increased risks of infants with birthweight of 1,500 g-1,999 g (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.67 [95%CI 1.11-2.52]) and small-for-gestational age births (AOR 1.90; 95%CI 1.05-3.46) in New York.

Methods: We assessed associations between prenatal exposure to wildland fire smoke and risk of preterm birth (gestational age < 37 weeks). We assigned smoke exposure to geocoded residence at birth for all live singleton births in California conceived 2007-2018, using weekly average concentrations of particulate matter <= 2.5 <mu>m (PM2.5) attributable to wildland fires from United States Environmental Protection Agency's Community Multiscale Air Quality Model. Logistic regression yielded odds ratio (OR) for preterm birth in relation to increases in average exposure across the whole pregnancy, each trimester, and each week of pregnancy. Models adjusted for season, age, education, race/ethnicity, medical insurance, and smoking of the birthing parent. Results: For the 5,155,026 births, higher wildland fire PM2.5 exposure averaged across pregnancy, or any trimester, was associated with higher odds of preterm birth. The OR for an increase of 1 mu g/m(3) of average wildland fire PM2.5 during pregnancy was 1.013 (95 % CI:1.008,1.017).

We examine nonlinearities in the dose-response relationship and find that the health impacts of PM2.5 vary across concentration levels. The effects of smoke on traumatic injuries are largest among the oldest workers (aged 60 and above) and the youngest workers (under 30), relative to those in middle age. We find that injuries occur even at levels of PM2.5 deemed safe under current regulations.

Wildfire activity is intensifying in Latin America due to climate and land-use changes, but the health impacts of wildfire-derived PM2.5 in urban areas remain poorly quantified and recognized. Objective. To assess the evidence on wildfire-related PM2.5 and its association with mortality and morbidity in Latin American cities. Materials and methods. We conducted a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines, using data from PubMed, Scopus, and Bireme. One reviewer independently screened 163 articles and extracted data from 14 eligible studies. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results. Most studies were conducted in Brazil (n = 12) and used time-series or modelling designs to estimate health risks. Wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure was associated with all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Reported effect estimates ranged from 1.7 to 7.7% increases in risk per 10 mu g/m3 of exposure. Other studies assessed preterm birth, COVID-19 outcomes, and site-specific cancers. While two studies provided harmonized RR estimates for all-cause mortality, high heterogeneity and methodological differences prevented formal meta-analysis. Conclusion. Wildfire smoke contributes measurably to premature mortality in Latin America, but current evidence is unevenly distributed across regions, time periods, and population subgroups. Studies rarely capture the disproportionate risks faced by indigenous and rural communities or the intraurban disparities linked to poverty and geography. Future research should focus on the health burden of morbidity linked to wildfire PM2.5.";"wildfires; climate change; particulate matter; mortality; morbidity; Latin America; BRAZIL; RISK";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

We examined whether Michael's effects on perinatal outcomes varied by maternity care availability and used the Baron and Kenny method to assess whether delayed PNC initiation mediated perinatal outcomes. Log-binomial regression and semi-parametric linear regression were used, controlling for maternal and ZIP code tabulation area characteristics.

Wildfire smoke contains numerous hazardous air pollutants and many studies have documented population health effects from this exposure. Objectives: We aimed to assess the evidence of health effects from exposure to wildfire smoke and to identify susceptible populations. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature for studies of wildfire smoke exposure on mortality and on respiratory, cardiovascular, mental, and perinatal health. Within those reviewed papers deemed to have minimal risk of bias, we assessed the coherence and consistency of findings. Discussion: Consistent evidence documents associations between wildfire smoke exposure and general respiratory health effects, specifically exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Growing evidence suggests associations with increased risk of respiratory infections and all-cause mortality. Evidence for cardiovascular effects is mixed, but a few recent studies have reported associations for specific cardiovascular end points. Insufficient research exists to identify specific population subgroups that are more susceptible to wildfire smoke exposure. Conclusions: Consistent evidence from a large number of studies indicates that wildfire smoke exposure is associated with respiratory morbidity with growing evidence supporting an association with all-cause mortality.

Pollutants released into air, soil and groundwater from wildfires may impact embryo development leading to gastroschisis. Objective The objective of this study was to determine the association between wildfire exposure before and during pregnancy and the risk of foetal gastroschisis development. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study using The California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Linked Birth File linked to The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection data between 2007 and 2010. Pregnancies complicated by foetal gastroschisis were identified by neonatal hospital discharge ICD-9 code. Pregnancies were considered exposed to wildfire if the mother's primary residence zip code was within 15 miles to the closest edge of a wildfire. The exposure was further stratified by trimester or if exposed within 30 days prior to pregnancy. Multivariable log-binomial regression analyses were performed to estimate the association between wildfire exposure in each pregnancy epoch and foetal gastroschisis. Results Between 2007 and 2010, 844,348 (40%) births were exposed to wildfire in California. Compared with births without wildfire exposure, those with first-trimester exposure were associated with higher rates of gastroschisis, 7.8 vs. 5.7 per 10,000 births (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07, 1.54). Furthermore, those with prepregnancy wildfire exposure were also found to have higher rates of gastroschisis, 12.5 vs. 5.7 per 10,000 births, (aRR 2.17, 95% CI 1.42, 3.52). In contrast, second- and third-trimester wildfire exposures were not associated with foetal gastroschisis. Conclusions Wildfire exposure within 30 days before pregnancy was associated with more than two times higher risk of foetal gastroschisis, whereas a 28% higher risk was demonstrated if exposure was in the first trimester.";"environmental exposure; gastroschisis; pregnancy; wildfire; EARLY PRENATAL EXPOSURE; AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; UNITED-STATES; BIRTH-WEIGHT; HEALTH IMPACTS; PREVALENCE; TRENDS; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; DEFECTS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Methods: Project Medishare set up a field hospital in Port-au-Prince 48 hours after the event. Our institution staffed the pediatric component for 45 days, with sequential deployment of 9 volunteer medical teams. Evolving facility and manpower requirements and changing patient demographics over time were evaluated. Results: Delegations consisted of surgeons, pediatricians, nurses, operating room (OR) personnel, physical therapists, pharmacists, and support staff. Primary goals involved creation of a child-specific ward, pediatric OR, and a wound care center. Major inpatient demographic changes occurred as time from the disaster elapsed. Initial census showed that 93% of the patients were surgical admissions with 40% undergoing operations, mostly fracture and wound care, over the first week. Eight weeks later, medical illnesses accounted for 70% of inpatients, whereas OR volume dropped by more than 50%. A second trend involved increasing acuity of care. Initially, children were admitted for serious or limb-threatening, but usually not life-threatening, injuries. Within 2 months, one third of the patients were housed in the developing NICU/PICU; and only 12% were admitted for injuries related to the earthquake. This change in patient needs led to alterations in facility requirements and in staffing and leadership needs. Conclusion: A disaster involving significant casualties in a populated area demands the rapid development of a field facility with pediatric personnel. Requirements for equipment, manpower, medical records, and systems addressing volunteer stress and ethical dilemmas can be anticipated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigates the trend of perinatal mortality rates in Fukushima Prefecture and four neighboring prefectures (Miyagi, Gunma, Tochigi, and Ibaraki) after the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011. Material and methods. Japanese monthly perinatal mortality data on a prefecture level are available on a website of the Japanese government. A combined regression of perinatal mortality rates from the study region and the rest of Japan (the control region) is conducted. The regression model allows for an asymptotic lower limit and a level change of perinatal mortality rates in 2012-2017 in the study region relative to the predicted trend. Results. In 2012-2017, perinatal mortality in the study region shows a significant 10.6% increase relative to the trend in preceding years (p = 0.006). The excess mortality translates to 195 (95% CI: 28, 462) excess perinatal deaths. The increase is three times greater in Fukushima Prefecture than in the four neighboring prefectures and the difference in excess rates is statistically significant (p = 0.010).

A better understanding of the impacts of the resulting air pollution has important public health implications for the present day and the future. Method: We performed a systematic search to identify peer-reviewed scientific studies published since 1986 regarding impacts of wildfire smoke on health in exposed communities. We reviewed and synthesized the state of science of this issue including methods to estimate exposure, and identified limitations in current research. Results: We identified 61 epidemiological studies linking wildfire and human health in communities. The U.S. and Australia were the most frequently studied countries (18 studies on the U.S., 15 on Australia). Geographic scales ranged from a single small city (population about 55,000) to the entire globe. Most studies focused on areas close to fire events. Exposure was most commonly assessed with stationary air pollutant monitors (35 of 61 studies). Other methods included using satellite remote sensing and measurements from air samples collected during fires. Most studies compared risk of health outcomes between 1) periods with no fire events and periods during or after fire events, or 2) regions affected by wildfire smoke and unaffected regions. Daily pollution levels during or after wildfire in most studies exceeded U.S. EPA regulations. Levels of PM10, the most frequently studied pollutant, were 1.2 to 10 times higher due to wildfire smoke compared to non-fire periods and/or locations. Respiratory disease was the most frequently studied health condition, and had the most consistent results. Over 90% of these 45 studies reported that wildfire smoke was significantly associated with risk of respiratory morbidity. Conclusion: Exposure measurement is a key challenge in current literature on wildfire and human health. A limitation is the difficulty of estimating pollution specific to wildfires. New methods are needed to separate air pollution levels of wildfires from those from ambient sources, such as transportation. The majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with increased risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Children, the elderly and those with underlying chronic diseases appear to be susceptible. More studies on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are needed. Further exploration with new methods could help ascertain the public health impacts of wildfires under climate change and guide mitigation policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Existing evidence has generally found that drought impacts birthweight and infant sex, with differences by trimester. Additionally, less research has looked at the impact of excess rain on birth outcomes or focused on the impact of rainfall extremes in the preconception period. Using data from a large demographic surveillance system in Nepal, combined with a novel measure of drought/excess rainfall, we explore the impact of these on birthweight by time in pregnancy. Methods: Using survey data from the 2016 to 2019 Chitwan Valley Study in rural Nepal combined with data from Climate Hazards InfraRed Precipitation with Station, we explored the association between excess rainfall and drought and birthweight, looking at exposure in the preconception period, and by trimester of pregnancy. We also explore the impact of excess rainfall and drought on infant sex and delivery with a skilled birth attendant. We used multilevel regressions and explored for effect modification by maternal age. Results: Drought in the first trimester is associated with lower birthweight (beta = -82.9 g; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 164.7, -1.2) and drought in the preconception period with a high likelihood of having a male (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.01, 2.01).

However, whether hurricane exposure is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications is less known. Objective: To assess the immediate impact and lasting impact of Hurricane Sandy (Sandy) on pregnancy complications. Methods: Using time-series study, we estimated the relative risks (RRs) of emergency department (ED) visits for pregnancy complications in eight affected counties in New York State, based on data of 2005-2014. The immediate impact was estimated by comparing the ED visits of pregnancy complications during the Sandy period to the non-Sandy periods. For the lasting impact of Sandy, we estimated the RRs by contrasting the ED visits in the following 12 months after Sandy with the same months of other years. Results: We found that ED visits for overall pregnancy complications increased 6.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 22%, 10.5%) during the Sandy month. ED visits increased for threatened abortion (9.9%, 95% CI: 4.4%, 15.7%), threatened labor (10.1%, 95% CI: 1.9%, 18.9%), early onset of delivery (115.9%, 95% CI: 6.9%, 336.3%), renal disease (732%, 95% CI: 0.3%, 199.4%), and diabetes (423%, 95% CI: 15.0%, 76.0%).

This study aims to understand the after flood effects on children in the worst flood-hit districts of Assam during the last decades most devastating flood where more than 1,00,000 people were affected. Study design A cross sectional population-based study was done covering 7512 children of 0-12 years of age in 35 worse flood-affected villages in three districts of lower Assam for nutritional risk profiling, low birth weight and morbidity pattern. Method Anthropometric measurements of the children were compared with standard WHO definitions for nutritional risk profiling. ANOVA was conducted to see any relationship of nutritional status between the age groups and BMI for the districts. Two-factor ANOVA to analyse the effect of ARI on the morbidity status of different districts was done. District-wise and village-wise heat maps were generated to understand different nutritional parameters for analysing which areas within each district are more affected and why. Results The moderate (< 2SD) and severely underweight (< 3SD) children under 5 years of age were highest in the Barpeta district (45.5% and 24.2% respectively). The moderate and severe stunting was highest in Morigaon (47.6%) and Barpeta (24.3%) respectively. The moderate and severe wasting was highest in the Morigaon district (46.1% and 20.6% respectively). All the nutritional indicators were less than the WHO standard. The age-wise and district-wise distribution of nutritional status shows variations in all three districts. Severe underweight was observed highest among 24-35 months' children (50.9%) in Barpeta. The moderate and severe undernutrition status was found to be higher among the age group of 10-12 years of age compared to 5 to 10 years. Conclusion This survey has provided a comprehensive picture of the nutritional status of the targeted children in the worst flood-affected areas. However, attention to its impact on health particularly among those exposed at very early stages in life is still lacking. This kind of rapid assessment helps to understand the health and nutritional status of the vulnerable groups in a deeper way and to plan robust region-specific interventions.";"Flood; Flooding emergency; Nutritional status; Children; Morbidity pattern; HEALTH";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Here, we develop an approach to control for physical exposure by spatially interacting meteorological and socioeconomic data for over 1,000 tropical cyclone disasters from 1979 to 2016. We find evidence that higher levels of national government effectiveness are associated with lower tropical cyclone mortality, even when controlling for average income and other socioeconomic conditions. Within countries, deaths are higher when strong winds are concentrated over areas of the country with elevated infant mortality rates, an indicator of institutional effectiveness through public service delivery.

However, the availability of perinatal resources in communities impacted by smoke is unknown. Objective: Describe perinatal resources in counties prone to wildfire smoke. Research Study Design: Smoke data came from the Hazard Mapping System and perinatal resources were gathered from various sources. Choropleth maps described the geographic distribution of smoke. Unadjusted associations and multivariable regressions compared perinatal resource levels by smoke risk. Subgroup analysis of the most rural counties was conducted. Subjects: Counties in the contiguous United States (n=3108) during the 2016-2020 period. Measures: Relative smoke risk was defined as the bottom, middle, and top third of the average annual smoke-days distribution.

The results of our recent studies indicate that piglets with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) have a reduced ability to synthesize glycine. The present study determined the role of glycine in the growth of sow-reared IUGR piglets. In Experiment 1, 56 newborn piglets (postnatal day 0) with a low birth weight (<1.10 kg) were selected from 14 litters, providing 4 IUGR piglets/litter that were allotted randomly into one of four treatment groups (14 piglets/group). Piglets received oral administration of either 0, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 g glycine/kg body weight (BW) twice daily (i.e., 0, 0.2, 0.4 or 0.8 g glycine/kg BW/day) between 0 and 14 days of age. L-Alanine was used as the isonitrogenous control. The BWs of all piglets were recorded each week during the experiment. Two weeks after the initiation of glycine supplementation, blood and tissue samples were collected for biochemical analyses. In Experiment 2, rates of muscle protein synthesis in tissues were determined on day 14 using the H-3-phenylalanine flooding dose technique. Compared with piglets in the control group, oral administration of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 g glycine/kg BW/day did not affect their milk intake (p > 0.05) but increased (p < 0.05) concentrations of glycine in plasma by 1.52-, 1.94-, and 2.34-fold, respectively, and body weight by 20%, 37%, and 34%, respectively. The dose of 0.4 g glycine/kg BW/day was the most cost-effective. Consistent with its growth-promoting effect, glycine supplementation stimulated (p < 0.05) the phosphorylation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (p70(S6K)) as well as protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, compared with the control group. Collectively, oral administration of glycine activated the MTOR signaling pathway in skeletal muscle and enhanced the growth performance of IUGR piglets. These results indicate that endogenous synthesis of glycine is inadequate to meet the needs of IUGR piglets during the suckling period and that oral supplementation with glycine to these compromized neonates can improve their growth performance.";"amino acids; glycine; growth; IUGR piglets; milk; nutrition; protein synthesis; STIMULATES PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; AMINO-ACIDS; CREATINE SYNTHESIS; NEONATAL PIGLETS; BIRTH-WEIGHT; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; DIETARY ARGININE; LIPID-METABOLISM; MEAT QUALITY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Additionally, wildfires are of growing concern due to their increasing frequency and severity. The objective was to examine the impact of wildfire smoke on fertility, timing of birth, and pregnancy loss for field monkeys. A unique case-control study to investigate birth outcomes in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) was conducted at the CNPRC. All females in the study were maintained in outdoor fields during a period of elevated ambient wildfire smoke from November 8-22, 2018. In addition to ambient air quality evaluations, the effects on fertility, timing to birth, and pregnancy loss were documented. Archival records of approximately 5,000 conceptions from the previous nine years served as control data. During the Camp Fire, ambient fine particulate (PM 2.5) levels exceeded the 24 -h National Ambient Air Quality Standard (35 mu g/m 3) of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, reaching levels as high as 185 mu g/m 3. A statistically significant association was observed between birth loss and the 2018-2019 CNPRC breeding season.

The rate of neonatal mortality reduction in Ethiopia is slow, and Ethiopia may not meet the third United Nations sustainable development target by 2030. This study aimed to investigate the spatial variations and contributing factors for neonatal mortality rates in Ethiopia. Methods We analysed data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS), which used a two-stage cluster sampling technique with a census enumeration area as primary and households as secondary sampling units. A Bayesian spatial logistic regression model using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) method was fitted accounting for socio-economic, health service-related and geographic factors. Results Higher neonatal mortality rates were observed in eastern, northeastern and southeastern Ethiopia, and the Somali region had higher risks of neonatal mortality. Neonates from frequently drought-affected areas had a higher mortality risk than less drought-affected areas. Application of traditional substances on the cord increased the risk of neonatal mortality (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.07, 95% Credible Interval (CrI): 1.12 to 4.30) and getting health facility delivery services had a lower odds of neonatal mortality (AOR = 0.60, 95% CrI: 0.37, 0.98).

Our survival analyses combine several rare and valuable long-term datasets, including long-term primate life-history, landscape-scale fruit abundance, food-tree mortality, and climate conditions. Infant capuchins showed a threshold mortality response to drought, with exceptionally high mortality during a period of intense drought, but not during periods of moderate water shortage. By contrast, spider monkey females stopped reproducing during severe drought, and the mortality of infant spider monkeys peaked later during a period of low fruit abundance and high food-tree mortality linked to the drought.

She remained buried under the rubbles until she could be excavated next day. Patient reached our facility almost 27 h after the incident.

Primary repair of jejunal and uterine perforations with suprapubic cystostomy (SPC) was followed by repair of the anterior vaginal wall at a later stage. Patient was discharged in healthy condition and is doing well on follow-up.

Disaster preparedness is key to a well-coordinated response to preventing sexual violence and assisting survivors, reducing the transmission of HIV and other STIs, and preventing excess maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. This study aimed to identify the capacity development activities undertaken as part of the SPRINT program in Fiji and Tonga and how these enabled the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) response to Tropical Cyclones Winston and Gita. Methods This descriptive qualitative study was informed by a framework designed to assess public health emergency response capacity across various levels (systems, organisational, and individual) and two phases of the disaster management cycle (preparedness and response). Eight key informants were recruited purposively to include diverse individuals from relevant organisations and interviewed by telephone, Zoom, Skype and email. Template analysis was used to examine the data. Findings Differences in the country contexts were highlighted. The existing program of training in Tonga, investment from the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) Humanitarian Hub, the status of the Tonga Family Health Association as the key player in the delivery of SRH, together with its long experience of delivering contract work in short time-frames and strong relationship with the Ministry of Health (MoH) facilitated a relatively smooth and rapid response. In contrast, there had been limited capacity development work in Fiji prior to Winston, requiring training to be rapidly delivered during the immediate response to the cyclone with the support of surge staff from IPPF. In Fiji, the response was initially hampered by a lack of clarity concerning stakeholder roles and coordination, but linkages were quickly built to enable a response. Participants highlighted the importance of personal relationships, individuals' and organisations' motivation to respond, and strong rapport with the community to deliver SRH. Discussion This study highlights the need for comprehensive activities at multiple levels within a country and across the Pacific region to build capacity for a SRH response. While the SPRINT initiative has been implemented across several regions to improve organisational and national capacity preparedness, training for communities can be strengthened. This research outlines the importance of formalising partnerships and regular meetings and training to ensure the currency of coordination efforts in readiness for activation. However, work is needed to further institutionalise SRH in emergencies in national policy and accountability mechanisms. Plain Language Summary Pacific Island countries experience many disasters, including cyclones and earthquakes. The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) has been working in the Pacific to help build skills to improve the response to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and rights during disasters. This paper describes research to identify capacity building activities that helped prepare organisations in Fiji and Tonga and how this affected the delivery of SRH during Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016, and Tropical Cyclone Gita in 2018. Key informants in senior positions from relevant organisations were recruited and interviewed by telephone, Zoom, Skype and email. We used a framework that described different levels of capacity across phases of the disaster management cycle to analyse the data. Eight key informants described differences in Fiji and Tonga's preparedness activities before Tropical Cyclones Winston and Gita that affected the way in which services were delivered. The Tonga Family Health Association was well established as a key player in SRH service delivery before Gita and had built relationships and delivered training for disaster response to staff across a number of organisations including the Ministry of Health (MoH). These preparedness efforts facilitated a smooth and rapid response. In Fiji, the response was initially affected by a lack of training, role clarity and coordination, but linkages were quickly built to deliver care and services. Participants highlighted the importance of personal relationships, individuals' and organisations' motivation to respond, and strong links with the community to deliver SRH care. This study highlights the need for inclusive activities at individual, organisational and national levels within countries and across the Pacific region to build capacity for a SRH response.";"Sexual and reproductive health; Pacific Islands; Humanitarian crisis; Preparedness; Capacity building; Disaster response";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

In the present study, we sought to determine the prevalence and risks of mental disorders in adults who experienced earthquake as an infant or in the prenatal period. Methods: This cross-sectional cohort study recruited participants based on the urban resident registry of Tangshan, Hebei province, 2013 using a multistage stratified cluster sampling method with selection probabilities proportional to size. We recruited subjects who were born between July 29, 1975 and April 28, 1978 that was one year before and 1.9 years after the occurrence of Tangshan Earthquake, respectively. Current psychiatric diagnoses and lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were obtained through the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders Patient Research Version.

Results: Totally1380 subjects were included with 392 subjects exposed to the earthquake in the fetal period, 399 subjects who experienced the earthquake during their infancy, and 589 subjects who had no exposure to the earthquake. Twenty-one (2.7%; current 1.9%) subjects exposed to earthquake were diagnosed with major depressive disorderversus 2.3% (current 1.5%) in the non-exposure group. Five (0.6%; current 0.6%) subjects with exposure to earthquake had bipolar disorder versus 0.9% in the non-exposure group. Thirteen (1.6%; current 1.6%) subjects with exposure to earthquake had schizophreniaversus 0.2% in the non-exposure group (P = 0.006). Furthermore, 5.2% (current 3.7%) subjects with exposure to earthquake had anxiety disorders versus 5.7% (current 3.9%) in the non-exposure group. Moreover, 8.1% (current 7.0%)subjects with exposure to earthquake had alcohol use disorders versus 7.1% (current 5.3%) in the non-exposure group.

An increased study region is chosen, and the study period is extended to 2019. Methods Japanese monthly perinatal mortality data are provided on a prefecture level by the Japanese government. The study region consists of 12 prefectures around the FDNPP; the rest of Japan is used as the control region. A combined non-linear regression of perinatal mortality rates in the study- and control regions is conducted. The regression model allows for a common asymptotic lower limit of perinatal mortality, seasonal variations, and periodic peaks in 2012-2019 in the study region. To determine the dependency of the effect on distance from the FDNPP, the study region is divided into four core prefectures and eight prefectures surrounding the core prefectures. Results Perinatal mortality rates in the study region show a significant 6.4% (95% CI: 1.8%, 13.4%) overall increase in 2012-2019 relative to the trend in preceding years with no attenuation during 2012-19. The increase translates to 590 (165, 1226) excess perinatal deaths (p = 0.016). It is characterized by annual peaks with maxima in April. A 13.6% increase is determined in the four core prefectures and a 4.3% increase in eight prefectures surrounding the core prefectures. Before 2012, there is a peak around April 2011 and a decline in October 2011; another significant peak is detected in November 2012. In the 4 core prefectures, large increases are found in the first quarter of 2018 (+70%) and in May 2019 (+130%). Conclusion This study finds periodic peaks in perinatal mortality in spring 2012-2019 in 12 prefectures of Japan surrounding the FDNPP. In light of massive increases in 2018 and 2019 in the four core prefectures, continued investigation of perinatal mortality in contaminated regions of Japan is recommended.";"CHERNOBYL; GERMANY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

As a genetically homogenous population that is closely monitored for health, dairy cattle present a unique opportunity to assess the association between changes in air pollution and mammalian health. Milk yield decreases in the summer if temperature and humidity, measured by the Temperature Humidity Index (THI). As O-3 levels increase with warmer temperatures, and summer PM2.5 may increase with wildfire smoke, dairy cows may serve as a useful sentinel species to evaluate subacute markers of inflammation and metabolic output and ambient pollution. Over two years, we assessed summertime O-3 and PM2.5 concentrations from local US EPA air quality monitors into an auto-regressive mixed model of the association between THI and daily milk production data and bulk tank somatic cell count (SCC). In unadjusted models, a 10 unit increase THI was associated with 28,700 cells/mL (95% CI: 17,700, 39,690) in-crease in SCC. After controlling for ambient air pollutants, THI was associated with a 14,500 SCC increase (95% CI: 3,400, 25,680), a 48% decrease in effect compared to the crude model. Further, in fully adjusted models, PM2.5 was associated with a 105,500 cells/mL (95% CI: 90,030, 121,050) increase in SCC. Similar results were found for milk production. Results were amplified when high PM2.5 days (95th percentile of observed values) associated with wildfire smoke were removed from the analyses. Our results support the hypothesis that PM2.5 confounds the relationships between THI and milk yield and somatic cell count.

In most studies disaster-affected populations were assumed to have experienced psychological trauma, but exposure to trauma was measured in only four studies. Furthermore, effects of both physical exposure to toxicants and psychological trauma on disaster-affected populations were examined in only one study. Effects on birth outcomes were not consistently demonstrated, and study methodologies varied widely. Even so, these studies suggest an association between disasters and reproductive health and highlight the need for further studies to clarify associations.

Methods: We analyzed mortality data obtained from the official cause of death statistics in Finland from 1969 to 2004. Annual mortality rates were calculated in proportion to those at risk of dying. Comparison of cause specific mortality rates was conducted for neonatal group and children aged 1 month to 15 years. Results: Annual neonatal mortality declined from 11.13 parts per thousand in 1969 to 2.46 parts per thousand in 2004. The leading causes of death were perinatal disorders and congenital malformations. Mortality among children aged 1 month to 15 years declined from 0.67 parts per thousand in 1969 to 0.23 parts per thousand in 2004, with accidents the leading cause of death, although congenital malformations, tumours and haematological diseases, and infectious diseases were significant causes as well. There was a notable peak in total mortality in 2004, as 44 Finnish children died in the Asian tsunami in December of that year. Conclusion: Childhood mortality in Finland has decreased significantly during recent decades.

Training programs can promote natural disaster readiness to respond and evacuate patients safely, but also require evidence-based information to guide learning objectives. Problem: There is limited evidence on what skills and bedside equipment are most important to include in disaster training and evacuation programs for critically ill infants. Methods: An expert panel was used to create a 13-item mastery checklist of skills for bedside registered nurses (RNs) required to successfully evacuate a critically ill infant. Expert nurses were surveyed, and the Angoff method was used to determine which of the mastery checklist skills a newly graduated nurse (ie, the ""minimally competent"" nurse) should be able to do. Participants then rated the importance of 26 commonly available pieces of bedside equipment for use in evacuating a hemodynamically unstable, intubated infant during a disaster. Results: Twenty-three emergency department (ED) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) charge RNs responded to the survey with a mean of 19 (SD = 9) years of experience and 30% reporting personal experience with evacuating patients. The skills list scores showed an emphasis on the newly graduated nurse having more complete mastery of skills surrounding thermoregulation, documentation, infection control, respiratory support, and monitoring. Skills for communication, decision making, and anticipating future needs were assessed as less likely for a new nurse to have mastered. On a scale of one (not important) to seven (critically important), the perceived necessity of equipment ranged from a low of 1.6 (breast pump) to a high of 6.9 (face mask). The individual intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.55 showed moderate reliability between raters and the average team ICC of 0.97 showed excellent agreement as a group. Conclusion: Experts rated the ability to manage physiological issues, such as thermoregulation and respiratory support, as skills that every nurse should master. Disaster preparedness activities for nurses in training may benefit from checklists of essential equipment and skills to ensure all nurses can independently manage patients' physiologic needs when they enter the workforce. Advanced nursing training should include education on decision making, communication during emergencies, and anticipation of future issues to ensure that charge and resource nurses can support bedside nurses during evacuation events.";"disaster; hospital evacuation; infant; nursing training; NURSES; PREPAREDNESS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Aim The aim of this study was to explore the experiences, challenges and decision-making mechanisms of nurses working in neonatal ICUs (NICUs) during an earthquake. Study Design This study employed a qualitative exploratory research design with a phenomenological approach. In-depth individual interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide between January and April 2025. A total of 18 nurses who worked in the NICUs of two different hospitals during and after the 2023 Kahramanmara & scedil; earthquakes in Turkey were included in the study using criterion sampling. Data were analysed using inductive content analysis methods. The Max Qualitative Data Analysis (2020) software was used for data coding. Results As a result of the data analysis, three main themes and 13 sub-themes were identified. The themes were as follows: 'Emergency Response and Implementation Challenges', 'Strategies Developed for the Safety of Newborns' and 'Psychological and Emotional Burdens of Nurses'. In addition, the topics 'Insufficiency in Material Supply', 'Problems Arising from Inadequate Staffing' and 'Experience of Loss and Grief' were found to be mentioned more frequently than other codes. Conclusions The findings showed that nurses faced challenges stemming from multiple professional, organisational, environmental and educational factors during the early phase of the disaster. Participants' perspectives revealed a strong relationship between professional competence in first response, disaster preparedness, traumatic burden and burnout. Relevance to Clinical Practice Identifying the challenges experienced by vulnerable populations during disasters, integrating these groups into disaster management plans, developing guidelines, promoting professional knowledge exchange and regularly conducting hands-on disaster training are of great importance.";"disaster; disaster management; earthquake; neonatal intensive care; paediatric nursing; DISASTER";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Maternal underweight and anemia are highly prevalent in Bihar, especially among adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 years. Although numerous programs and platforms exist for delivering efficacious interventions for improving maternal nutrition, the coverage and quality of these interventions are low. Objective. To examine existing interventions for reducing maternal undernutrition in Bihar and identify barriers to and opportunities for expanding their coverage and quality. Methods. The research was conducted in New Delhi and Bihar between May and August 2010. Forty-eight key informant interviews were conducted with policy makers, program managers, and service providers at multiple levels. Secondary data were collected from survey reports and program documents. All data were analyzed thematically. Results. Barriers to the delivery and uptake of interventions to improve maternal nutrition include the shortage of essential inputs, low prioritization of maternal undernutrition, sterilization bias within the family planning program, weak management systems, poverty, gender inequality, caste discrimination, and flooding. In order to overcome barriers and improve service delivery, the current government and its partners have introduced structural reforms within the public health system, launched new programs for underserved groups, developed innovative approaches, and experimented with new technologies. Conclusions. Since coming to power, the Government of Bihar has achieved impressive increases in the coverage of prioritized health services, such as institutional deliveries and immunization. This success presents it with an excellent opportunity to further reduce maternal and infant mortality by turning its attention to the serious problem of maternal undernutrition and low birthweight.";"Bihar; maternal and child health; maternal nutrition; nutritional interventions; women's health; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; ANTHELMINTIC TREATMENT; CHILD UNDERNUTRITION; GROWTH-RETARDATION; FETAL; MICRONUTRIENTS; CONSEQUENCES; ENERGY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Design Retrospective cohort study. Choice of variables informed by literature and Delphi consensus. Setting Study conducted during the baseline phase of a community level intervention for pre-eclampsia that was led by community health workers. Participants A household census identified 50 493 households that were home to 80 483 women of reproductive age (age 12-49 years). Of these women, 14 617 had been pregnant in the 12 months prior to the census, of which 9172 (61.6%) had completed their pregnancies. Primary and secondary outcome measures A combined fetal, maternal and neonatal outcome was calculated for all women with completed pregnancies. Results A total of six variables were statistically significant (p=0.05) in explaining the combined outcome. These included: geographic isolation, flood proneness, access to an improved latrine, average age of reproductive age woman, family support and fertility rates. The performance of the ordinary least squares model was an adjusted R-2=0.69. Three of the variables (isolation, latrine score and family support) showed significant geographic variability in their effect on rates of adverse outcome. Accounting for this modest non-stationary effect through geographically weighted regression increased the adjusted R-2 to 0.71. Conclusions The community exploration was successful in identifying context-specific determinants of maternal health. The results highlight the need for designing targeted interventions that address the place-specific social determinants of maternal health in the study area. The geographic process of identifying and measuring these determinants, therefore, has implications for multisectoral collaboration.";"HEALTH; MORTALITY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

After Katrina, obstetric, prenatal, and neonatal care was compromised in the short term, but increases in adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight, and maternal complications were mostly limited to highly exposed women. Both pregnant and postpartum women had rates of post-traumatic stress disorder similar to, or lower than, others exposed to Katrina, and rates of depression similar to other pregnant and postpartum populations. Health behaviors, such as smoking and breastfeeding, may have been somewhat negatively affected by the disaster, whereas effects on nutrition were likely associated with limited time, money, and food choices, and indicated by both weight gain and loss. We conclude that, with a few specific exceptions, postdisaster concerns and health outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women were similar to those of other people exposed to Hurricane Katrina. In such situations, disaster planners and researchers should focus on providing care and support for the normal concerns of the peripartum period, such as breastfeeding, depression, and smoking cessation.

Changes in population size, composition, and distribution may result from these occurrences. This study, which spans the years 1966-2018, looks at how Bangladesh's total fertility rate (TFR) is affected by extreme weather events and child mortality, including neonatal, infant, male infant, and under-five mortality. We use data from secondary publicly accessible sources, such as the World Bank and The Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), and we investigate the correlations using the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), complemented by bivariate and multivariable analyses. Our findings from the univariate analysis are noteworthy. Total extreme climate events ((3 = -0.345, 95 % CI: 0.510, -0.180), as well as individual extreme climate events, such as extreme temperatures ((3 = -1.176, 95 % CI: 1.88, -0.47), floods ((3 = - 0.644, 95 % CI: 1.0729, -0.216), and storms ((3 = -0.351, 95 % CI: 0.63159, -0.07154), exhibited negative associations with the TFR. Additionally, factors such as contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) ((3 = -0.085, 95 % CI: 0.09072, -0.07954) and gross national income (GNI) per capita ((3 = -0.003, 95 % CI: 0.0041123, -0.0024234) were negatively correlated with the TFR. Conversely, various categories of child mortality, namely, infants ((3 = 0.041, 95 % CI: 0.040474, 0.042748), males ((3 = 0.038, 95 % CI:0.037719, 0.039891), and under-five ((3 = 0.026, 95 % CI:0.025684, 0.026979) - are positively associated with TFR. Controlling for two pivotal confounding factors, time and GNI per capita, yielded consistent results in the multivariate analysis. These findings provide insight on the dual impact of extreme weather events, which can reduce TFR while also raising it through infant mortality. This phenomena may be due to the increased vulnerability of younger children in climate-event-prone areas, prompting parents to seek additional children as both a replacement for lost offspring and an insurance mechanism against future child loss.";"Floods; Storms; Extreme temperature events; Child mortality; Total fertility rate (TFR); Bangladesh; NATURAL DISASTERS; HURRICANE KATRINA; CONTRACEPTIVE USE; SEX-RATIO; BIRTH; POPULATION; ENVIRONMENT; MARRIAGE; HEALTH; IMPACT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The nearly logarithmic annual decline in maternal and perinatal mortality rates suggests that, in addition to advances in medicine and healthcare, various types of care for mothers and newborns have played a crucial role in this achievement.MethodFrom the period of World War II to the postwar era, up to around 1980, and then every decade thereafter, the events and movements surrounding perinatal healthcare in each era were examined from the perspectives of epidemiology, medical/healthcare advancements, and institutional/policy trends.ResultsThe major events in each era are outlined as follows: Until around 1980: After World War II, in 1948, several laws were enacted to protect mothers and fetuses, including the Maternal and Child Health Handbook, in 1966. The number of births experienced a baby boom for about 10 years following 1945, peaking in 1973. Birthplaces shifted from home deliveries to medical facilities, with doctors becoming the primary birth attendants. Academically, the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (JAOG) for Maternal Protection and the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG) were established in 1949. In the medical field, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) were introduced and neonatal transport systems became well-established by the 1970s. In 1976, the limit of viability was revised from under 28 weeks of gestation to under 24 weeks. The late 1970s saw the fetal heart rate monitoring, the heartbeat detection using Doppler ultrasound and the ultrasound imaging techniques. 1980s: The perinatal medicine became well established, leading to hold The Japan Society of Perinatal Medicine. For fetal management, the fields of fetal diagnosis and fetal treatment entered their early stages with the widespread use of fetal heart rate monitoring and ultrasound imaging. In neonatal care, neonatal transport systems to NICU facilities were enhanced. A major breakthrough in this field was the discovery and widespread use of pulmonary surfactant. Two key concepts that emerged and advanced during this period were maternal transport systems and the Perinatal Maternal and Child Center initiative. In 1987, cases of hepatitis caused by non-heat-treated coagulation products became a major issue. As a result, informed consent affecting mothers and fetuses became a significant point of discussion. The Obstetrics and Gynecology Specialist system was introduced, along with the regular publication of Training Notes for Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Glossary of Obstetrics and Gynecology Terms. As a result of these efforts, both the perinatal mortality rate and the maternal mortality rate were reduced by approximately half over the course of 10 years. 1990s: In 1991, the limit of viability was revised to 22 weeks of gestation. In terms of maternal care, nutritional management guidelines for general pregnant women were introduced. In fetal medicine, major topics included the administration of steroids to the mother to promote fetal lung maturation, as well as direct fetal treatments such as shunt procedures and needle aspirations. In neonatal care, inhaled nitric oxide therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment became more widely adopted. Following the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, in 1995, led to the development of the Disaster Medical Assistance Team and the establishment of Perinatal Maternal and Child Medical Center. In 1996, the Maternal Protection Law was enacted, and the Japan Council for Quality Health Care (JCQHC) was founded to standardize medical care. Asia & Oceania Federation of Obstetrics & Gynecology Journal and Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology Research were launched as English-language academic journals. 2000s: Japan's perinatal mortality rate became the lowest in the world, but the maternal mortality rate was still struggling. Obstetric care changed significantly after an obstetrician was arrested for causing a maternal death during a cesarean section. The JSOG and the JAOG developed practice guidelines describing standard obstetric diagnosis and treatments, and the JCQHC established the Japan Obstetric Compensation System for Cerebral Palsy. In addition, a project to report on maternal deaths by JAOG was also launched, and the combination of these measures led to form a framework of professional autonomy for obstetricians. During this period, brain hypothermic therapy for brain injury was developed. 2010s: The Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 led to major changes in disaster medical planning. This included the introduction of training programs for disaster medical coordinators and the development of disaster-time pediatric and perinatal liaisons. To enhance medical safety, JAOG launched an incidental case reporting system in 2004. Additionally, in 2010, a maternal mortality reporting system was introduced, followed by the maternal severe complications reporting system in 2021. The Japan Council for Implementation of Maternal Emergency Life-Saving System was established, along with the Japan Association for Labor Analgesia, a collaborative council for academic societies and organizations related to painless delivery. Suicide as a significant cause of maternal death led to the establishment of the ""Mother and Child Mental Forum"" academic conference, which later evolved into the Mental Health Care for Mother & Child training program. In the field of prenatal testing, non-invasive prenatal testing was introduced as a clinical research initiative. From 2020 onward: The year 2020 began with the global outbreak of COVID-19. Until 2023, numerous issues arose due to repeated pandemics, including delivery methods and locations for COVID-positive pregnant women, standard precautions during labor, mother-infant separation after birth, vaccination, so on. JSOG and JAOG worked together to address these challenges. The most pressing issue in the perinatal field is the declining birth rate. Alongside an aging workforce of physicians and a shortage of successors, the decrease in new obstetric clinic openings has become a major concern. By 2024, the decrease in the number of full-time obstetricians and the overtime work limits in Medical Care Act are making it necessary to reconsider the structure of obstetric medical services. Japan's perinatal care system, which has maintained the highest global standards, now stands at a major crossroads.ConclusionResearchers (clinicians), academic societies, and professional organizations, centered on the mother and child, have collaborated with support from the government, making progress and building the current safe pregnancy and childbirth management system. However, significant issues remain that need urgent attention, including regulations on overtime work, securing obstetrician numbers, the rapid decline in childbirth facilities, and the functional collapse of perinatal maternal-child healthcare centers. These are critical challenges that must be addressed promptly.";"advance in obstetrical care; JAOG; JSOG; maternal mortality; perinatal mortality; THERAPY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Here we show that measures of human development and rural areas explain more of the variance of displacement vulnerability than income levels measured by gross domestic product. We combine global flood and displacement data to estimate vulnerability, as the ratio of displacement to exposure, for over 300 historical flood events. We find that this vulnerability varies by several orders of magnitude both between and within countries. A random forest regression shows that infant mortality rate and population density are among the most important predictors of displacement vulnerability at national level and within countries, respectively, highlighting the vulnerability of low-income and marginalized populations and of rural communities. Our results indicate that, rather than relying on overall economic development alone, targeted investments are needed to improve living conditions and coping capacities for the most vulnerable groups, particularly outside of large cities, and to prepare for increasing flood hazards due to climate change.";"SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CROSS-VALIDATION; RISK; MODEL; POPULATION; HAZARD";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Drought as a complex phenomenon causes severe impacts on ecological and socio-economic status. Short-term and long-term occurrences of drought have made many regions vulnerable globally. This paper makes an attempt to assess drought vulnerability in Godavari Middle Sub-basin of India. Twenty-four site specific socio-economic and environmental factors were identified based on the extensive literature review. Drought frequency was assessed using standardized precipitation index (SPI). These datasets were divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) data. Frequency ratio (FR) model was utilized to establish relationship among drought conditioning factors and drought frequency. Weights obtained from the FR model were used as input to the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) model. Drought vulnerability results were validated using the testing data and receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The accuracy of ANFIS models for 1-month (0.957), 3-months (0.882), 6-months (0.964) and 12-months (0.938) showed high suitability of ANFIS model for the assessment of drought vulnerability. The findings revealed that very low normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and increasing trend of highest maximum and mean maximum temperature were major environmental factors which influenced high drought vulnerability in the sub-basin. High proportion of area under fallow land, high infant mortality rate (IMR) and moderate literacy rate were identified as major socio-economic factors making watersheds vulnerable during short and long-term droughts. Largest area of the sub-basin was found under high vulnerability for 3-months, followed by 6-months and 12-months droughts. Thus, the study calls for policy intervention towards lessening the impact of drought in highly vulnerable watersheds.";"Drought vulnerability; SPI index; Frequency ratio model; ANFIS model; Godavari middle sub-basin; DIFFERENCE WATER INDEX; RIVER-BASIN; STATE; VEGETATION; IMPACTS; CLIMATE; RISK; AGRICULTURE; NDWI";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

In this study, we estimate the impact of displacement on infant and child mortality and key health-behavior mechanisms. Methods: We employ a difference-in-differences (DID) design with coarsened exact matching (CEM) to ensure comparability among groups with different displacement status using the 2012 Haiti Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The participants are 21,417 births reported by a nationally representative sample of 14,287 women aged 15-49. The main independent variables are household displacement status which includes households living in camps, IDP households (not in camps), and households not displaced. The main outcomes are infant and child mortality; health status (height-for-age, anemia); uptake of public health interventions (bed net use, spraying against mosquitoes, and vaccinations); and other conditions (hunger; cholera). Results: Births from the camp households have higher infant mortality (OR = 2.34, 95 % CI 1.15 to 4.75) and child mortality (OR = 2.34, 95 % CI 1.10 to 5.00) than those in non-camp IDP households following the earthquake. These odds are higher despite better access to food, water, bed net use, mosquito spraying, and vaccines among camp households. Conclusions: IDP populations are heterogeneous and households that are displaced outside of camps may be self-selected or self-insured. Meanwhile, even households not displaced by a disaster may face challenges in access to basic necessities and health services. Efforts are needed to identify vulnerable populations to provide targeted assistance in post-disaster relief.";"Infant mortality; Child mortality; Internally displaced people; Earthquake; Haiti; EARTHQUAKE; PROGRESS; HEALTH";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

After industrial nuclear accident exposures, several long-term follow-up studies have shown a higher level of genome damage and higher accumulation of radioisotopes in the skeleton of children than of adults. Similarly, rogue cells in a long-term follow-up study of exposure in industrial regions are more frequently detected in children than in adults. Additionally, is impossible to predict the transplacental impact of radioisotopes on miscarriage rate using CA in mothers. Due to its transmutation to He, tritium level in water may have a more severe impact on DNA integrity in the foetus than in adults, which results from higher mitotic rate during development.

Governments must establish water security programs by planning the management of water resources, as a paradigm shift. Mexico is not the exception, a country of strong meteorological, hydrographic and social contrasts throughout its territory, which impact in different ways the population strata, similar to other developing countries. In this context, hazard, social vulnerability and risk indexes are proposed and quantified in this paper, through a probabilistic methodology for calculating water security. Hazard is expressed by basic water services shortage, floods, groundwater depletion, and drought indicators. In turn, the vulnerability considers educational level of the population, access to health services, infant mortality rate, illiteracy, housing conditions, unemployment and proportion of indigenous language population. In the development of this study it is shown that both hazard and vulnerability throughout the Mexican territory are very heterogeneous. The proposed probabilistic methodology was implemented in a Geographical Information System obtaining water security indexes for all municipalities in Mexico (2,456 municipalities).";"Water security; municipalities; probability; indices; risk; vulnerability";"";"";"";"";"Spanish";"JOUR";""

The increased prevalence of allergic airway disease worldwide can be partially attributed to those global environmental changes. Climate change and air pollution pose adverse impacts on respiratory allergies, and that the mechanisms are complex and interactive. Adverse weather conditions, such as extreme temperatures, can act directly on the respiratory tract to induce allergic respiratory illnesses. Thunderstorms and floods can alter the production and distribution of aeroallergens while wildfires and dust storms increase air pollution, and therefore indirectly enhance health risks. Concentrations of particulate matter and ozone in the air have been projected to increase with climate warming and air stagnation, and the rising temperatures and CO(2)increase pollen, molds, and spores, which escalate the risk of allergic respiratory diseases. The synergistic effects of extreme heat and aeroallergens intensify the toxic effect of air pollutants, which in turn augment the allergenicity of aeroallergens. With the Earth's climate change, migration of humans and plants shift the living environments and allergens of susceptible people. Urban residents are exposed to multiple factors while children are sensitive to environmental exposure. Since climate change may pose many unexpected and persistent effects on allergic respiratory diseases, health professionals should advocate for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies to minimize its respiratory health effects.";"Respiratory allergy; Climate change; Air pollution; Extreme weather events; Aeroallergen; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT VISITS; THUNDERSTORM-RELATED ASTHMA; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; TEMPERATURE-VARIATION; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; MATERNAL EXPOSURE; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; PRETERM BIRTH; NEW-ORLEANS; POLLEN";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

This study conceptualized vulnerability as a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity by developing a composite index from a reliable dataset of 64 indicators comprising biophysical, agro-ecological, and socioeconomic variables. The empirical studies of coastal Bangladesh revealed that Bhola, Patuakhali, and Lakshmipur districts, around the mouth of the deltaic Meghna estuaries, are the hot spot of vulnerability distribution. Furthermore, the spatially heterogeneous vulnerability was triggered by spatial variation of erosion, cyclones, drought, rain-fed agriculture, land degradation, soil phosphorus, crop productivity, sanitation and housing condition, infant mortality, emergency shelters, adoption of agro-technology. The integrated approach could be useful for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation intervention by substituting various hypothetical scenarios into the ALVI framework for baseline comparison.";"climate change; agriculture vulnerability; spatially heterogeneous; adaptation decision; coastal Bangladesh; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; VARIABILITY; FRAMEWORK; RISKS; COMMUNITIES; INDICATORS; IMPACTS; PERCEPTIONS; ADAPTATION; FISHERIES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

However, there are few detailed reports on emergency vitrification in a state of disaster, especially about oocytes and D0 zygotes. Therefore, the effectiveness and safety of emergency vitrification of oocytes and D0-D5 embryos in disaster states are still unclear.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective study was made in the Reproductive Medicine Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2018 to November 2022. The record rainstorms in Zhengzhou, China, caused severe flooding, traffic disruptions, and power outages. From 17:30, 20 July 2021 to 17:30, 21 July 2021, 1246 oocytes and D0-D5 embryos of 155 patients were vitrified whilst the laboratory had only an emergency power supply.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: As of 21 December 2021, 1149 emergency vitrified oocytes and D0-D5 embryos of 124 patients underwent frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET). They were divided into the following four groups according to the days of embryo culture in vitro: oocyte group, Day 0-Day 1 (D0-D1) group, Day 2-Day 3 (D2-D3) group, and Day 4-Day 5 (D4-D5) group. Control groups for each were selected from fresh cycle patients who underwent IVF/ICSI from January 2018 to October 2021. Control and emergency vitrification patients were matched on criteria that included age, fertilization method, days of embryonic development, and number and grade of transferred embryos. A total of 493 control patients were randomly selected from the eligible patients and matched with the emergency vitrification groups in a ratio of 4:1. The results of assisted reproduction and follow-up of pregnancy were analyzed. The embryonic development, clinical outcomes, and birth outcomes in each group were statistically analyzed.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A significant difference was observed in fertilization rate (81% versus 72%, P = 0.022) between the oocyte group and the control group. Significant differences were also observed in the monozygotic twin pregnancy rate (10% versus 0%, P = 0.038) and ectopic pregnancy rate (5% versus 0%, P = 0.039) between the D0-D1 group and the control group. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed between vitrified oocytes/D0-D1 embryos/D2-D3 embryos and the control group on the number of high-quality embryos (3.17 +/- 3.00 versus 3.84 +/- 3.01, P = 0.346; 5.04 +/- 3.66 versus 4.56 +/- 2.87, P = 0.346; 4.85 +/- 5.36 versus 5.04 +/- 4.64, P = 0.839), the number of usable blastocysts (1.22 +/- 1.78 versus 1.21 +/- 2.03, P = 0.981; 2.16 +/- 2.26 versus 1.55 +/- 2.08, P = 0.090; 2.82 +/- 3.23 versus 2.58 +/- 3.32, P = 0.706), clinical pregnancy rate (56% versus 57%, P = 0.915; 55% versus 55%, P = 1.000; 40% versus 50%, P = 0.488), miscarriage rate (30% versus 15%, P = 0.496; 5% versus 11%, P = 0.678; 17% versus 20%, P = 1.000), and live birth rate (39% versus 49%, P = 0.460; 53% versus 50%, P = 0. 772; 33% versus 40%, P = 0.635). No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed between the D4-D5 group and the control group on clinical pregnancy rate (40% versus 55%, P = 0.645), miscarriage rate (0% versus 18%, P = 1.000), and live birth rate (40% versus 45%, P = 1.000)LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The retrospective study design is a limitation. The timing and extent of natural disasters are unpredictable, so the sample size of vitrified oocytes, zygotes, and embryos is beyond experimental control.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study is the first study analyzing embryonic development, clinical outcomes, and birth outcomes of large samples of oocytes, D0 zygotes, and D1-D5 embryos after emergency vitrification under the disaster conditions. The results show that emergency vitrification is a safe and effective protective measure applicable to oocytes and D0-D5 embryos. The embryology laboratories need to be equipped with an emergency uninterrupted power supply capable of delivering for 6-8 h at full load.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S:) This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 81871206).

Post-Katrina vital statistics are unavailable. The objectives of this study were to validate an alternative method to estimate child mortality rates in the greater New Orleans area and compare pre-Katrina and post-Katrina mortality rates. Methods: Pre-Katrina 2004 child mortality was estimated from death reports in the local daily newspaper and validated by comparison with pre-Katrina data from the Louisiana Department of Health. Post-Katrina child mortality rates were analyzed as a measure of health consequences. Results: Newspaper-derived estimates of mortality rates appear to be valid except for possible underreporting of neonatal rates. Pre-Katrina and post-Katrina mortality rates were similar for all age groups except infants. Post-Katrina, a 92% decline in mortality rate occurred for neonates (<28 days), and a 57% decline in mortality rate occurred for postneonatal infants ( 28 days-1 year). The post-Katrina decline in infant mortality rate exceeds the pre-Katrina discrepancy between newspaper-derived and Department of Health-reported rates. Conclusions: A declining infant mortality rate raises questions about persistent displacement of high-risk infants out of the region. Otherwise, there is no evidence of long-lasting post-Katrina excess child mortality. Further investigation of demographic changes would be of interest to local decision makers and planners for recovery after public health emergencies in other regions.

Evidence is mounting that heatwaves are becoming increasingly linked with droughts in northeastern and southeastern Brazil, the Amazonia, and the Pantanal. In those regions, recent studies have begun to build a better understanding of the physical mechanisms behind CDHW events, such as the soil moisture-atmosphere coupling, promoted by exceptional atmospheric blocking conditions. Results hint at a synergy between CDHW events and high fire activity in the country over the last decades, with the most recent example being the catastrophic 2020 fires in the Pantanal.

From uranium mining and milling, to fuel manufacture, electricity generation and radioactive waste management, children in frontline and Indigenous communities can be disproportionately harmed due to often increased sensitivity of developing systems to toxic exposures, the lack of resources and racial and class discrimination. The reasons for the greater susceptibility of women and children to harm from radiation exposure is not fully understood. Regulatory practices, particularly in the establishment of protective exposure standards, have failed to take this difference into account. Anecdotal evidence within communities around nuclear facilities suggests an association between radiation exposure and increases in birth defects, miscarriages and childhood cancers. A significant number of academic studies tend to ascribe causality to other factors related to diet and lifestyle and dismiss these health indicators as statistically insignificant. In the case of a major release of radiation due to a serious nuclear accident, children are again on the frontlines, with a noted susceptibility to thyroid cancer, which has been found in significant numbers among children exposed both by the 1986 Chornobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine and the 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan.

In this article, we ask whether the social vulnerability of Amazonian cities to floods and droughts is linked to differences in their spatial accessibility. To assess the accessibility of 310 urban centers, we developed a travel network and derived measures of connectivity and geographical remoteness. We found that 914,654 people live in roadless urban centers (n = 68) located up to 2,820km from their state capital. We then tested whether accessibility measures explained interurban differences in quantitative measures of social sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and an overlooked risk area, food system sensitivity. Accessibility explained marked variation in indicators of each of these dimensions and, hence, for the first time, we show an underlying spatial basis for social vulnerability. For instance, floods pose a greater disease risk in less accessible urban centers because inadequate sanitation in these places exposes inhabitants to environmental pollution and contaminated water, exacerbated by poverty and governance failures. Exploring the root causes of these spatial inequalities, we show how remote and roadless cities in Amazonia have been historically marginalized and their citizens exposed to structural violence and economic disadvantage. Paradoxically, we found that places with the highest social vulnerability have the greatest natural and cultural assets (rainforest, indigenous peoples, and protected areas). We conclude that increasing accessibility through road building would be maladaptive, exposing marginalized people to further harm and exacerbating climatic change by driving deforestation.";"Brazil; cities; extreme events; remoteness; spatial inequalities; GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; BIRTH-WEIGHT; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ECONOMIC-GEOGRAPHY; FOOD INSECURITY; ADAPTATION; HEALTH; POPULATION; RESILIENCE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Early life events such as the effect of hyperoxia in the context of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and crucial effects of the intrauterine environment in the context of pre-eclampsia were discussed. The Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) was put forward as a new point of reference for healthy human lungs. The combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial data in the HLCA has enabled the discovery of new cell types/states and niches, and served as a platform that facilitates further investigation of mechanistic perturbations. The role of cell death modalities in regulating the onset and progression of chronic lung diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target was also discussed.

We systematically reviewed and assessed the strength and quality of the evidence on the relationship between drinking water with high sodium levels (> 200 mgNa/l) and adverse cardiovascular, renal, and pregnancy-related health outcomes, following the PRISMA guidelines, the ROBINS-E Cochrane tool and the Navigation Guide. From five bibliographic databases, we identified 22 relevant studies, some of which assessed more than one health domain. The evidence was of moderate quality and strength. 14 analyses from eight studies at low risk of bias and four studies at moderate risk of bias, linked drinking high-salinity water to adverse health outcomes including hypertension and cardiovascular disease, impaired renal function, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, and higher infant mortality. Eight studies were inconclusive. Three analyses, of which two at low risk of bias, associated drinking high-salinity water to improved health outcomes. Overall, our findings suggest that salinisation of drinking water sources is likely to increase adverse cardiovascular, renal, and pregnancy-related health outcomes. This conclusion highlights the importance of effective and timely adaptation at scale, and calls for a revision of the WHO guidelines for the intake of salt from water. The latest WHO guidelines (2022) do not set any health-based standard for sodium levels in drinking water, a problem that affects millions of people and will worsen with climate change.";"Climate change; Salinity; Drinking water; Cardiovascular health; Renal health; Maternal and infant health.; BLOOD-PRESSURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SODIUM; IMPACT; RISK; SALT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

We use monthly birth cohorts to determine if Japanese male births following the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 fell below levels expected from female births and from history (i.e., autocorrelation) among cohorts exposed to the Earthquake at or after conception. Methods We apply interrupted time-series methods to 69 months (i.e., April, 2006 through December, 2011) of birth data from the most and least affected prefectures as well as from the remainder of Japan. We estimate expected male births from female births and from autocorrelation. Results Findings varied by distance from the greatest damage but suggest sensitive periods both early and late in gestation when population stressors may induce selection against males in utero. Support for reduced conception of males appeared only in the prefectures most damaged by the Earthquake. Conclusions Results align with the claim that natural selection has conserved mechanisms that reduce the odds of a male live birth during stressful times by reducing the conception of males and by increasing the rate of spontaneous abortion among male fetuses.

Methods: In this prospective, observational study, contact persons used in the prior LDTT assessing hospital disaster preparedness in the lead-up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup made surge capacity assessments (licensed bed capacity plus surge capacity beds) for the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), medical intensive care unit (MICU), and general medical/surgical beds in each hospital. Following the 2010 World Cup, this data was then re-evaluated by an on-site survey team consisting of two of the authors. Results: The contact persons for the individual hospitals from the LDTT underreported their individual hospital's surge capacity in 86% (95% CI, 46%-99%) of RICU beds; 100% (95% CI, 63%-100%) of MICU beds; 75% (95% CI, 40%-94%) of NICU beds; and 71% (95% CI, 35%-92%) of medical/surgical beds compared with the on-site inspection team.

A conditional theory of environmental conflict predicts that drought increases the risk of civil war primarily when it strikes vulnerable and politically marginalized populations in agrarian societies. However, an empirical evaluation of this general proposition through a unique gridded dataset of postcolonial Africa, which combines high-resolution meteorological data with georeferenced data on civil war onset and the local ethnopolitical context, shows little evidence of a drought-conflict connection. Instead, the local risk of civil war can be explained by sociopolitical and geographic factors: a politically marginalized population, high infant mortality, proximity to international borders, and high local population density.";"ARMED CONFLICT; CIVIL CONFLICT; ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION; ECONOMIC SHOCKS; DETERMINANTS; SCARCITY; LEVEL; RAIN";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

However, Japanese evidence for labor outcomes is particularly lacking, as is the question of whether the impact of LBW on adulthood worsens when disasters occur. We aimed to reveal the impact on LBW on labor outcomes during the disaster recovery phase. Methods:We used a cross-sectional data set of 4156 national health insurance holders, males aged 40-60 years, from the Miyagi and Iwate prefectures during the earthquake recovery phase. Employing a multinomial probit and logistic model, we estimated the impact of LBW on the employment status, changes in income, and the propensity to face a decline in income with a job change. Results: The very low birth weights (VLBWs) have a disadvantage in all labor market outcomes. Compared to the non-LBWs, the VLBWs were 15.2% less likely to be full-time/self-employed and 17.1% more likely to be contingent/temporary/part-time workers. Moreover, 32.9% are more likely to face a decline in income and approximately 3.7 times more likely to change jobs leading to income decline. The LBWs were likely to face a decline in income by 8.6% and 4.6%, respectively, but no other significant effects were found on other outcomes. Conclusions: The effects were apparent for the VLBW, but not so much for the LBW.

These footprints in SIDS are associated with serious pathological changes, viz. elevated hepatic iron, bone marrow hyperplasia, hypomyelinated respiratory control centres, elevated lung immunoglobulins, cerebral hypoperfusion resembling lesions induced by chronic hypoxemia, ischemia, congenital heart disease and congenital myopathy. Hypoxia stimulates the immune response and the over-arousal of the immune response triggers a flood of NO. Adenosine triggers sleep. NO and adenosine are additive as dilators of coronary blood vessels. Blood pressure collapses. Selenium increases the activity of the enzyme ferrochelatase during incorporation of heme into cytochrome oxidase. NO binds to cytochrome oxidase, inhibiting respiration. When NO reaches dangerous levels, the cell turns on production of heme oxygenase. Heme is broken down to iron (Fe) carbon monoxide (CO) and bile pigments. NO has a huge affinity for hemoglobin which catalyses NO degradation to nitrate. Furthermore, NO is a product of smoke and SIDS incidence is higher in smoking mothers.

Results: This study found that both academic literatures and media have suggested the basic causes of child malnutrition such as economic deprivation, low parental education, contradictory local traditional beliefs and long drought. The causes then influenced households in purchasing power for food, providing appropriate foods, housing condition, utilization of child health care, parental awareness and knowledge about child nutrition.

Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) per IQR increase were 1.15 (95% CI, 1.12-1.18; P < .001) for PM2.5 (IQR, 2.76 mu g/m3), 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11-1.20; P < .001) for black carbon (IQR, 1.05 mu g/m3), 1.09 (95% CI, 1.06-1.13; P < .001) for nitrate (IQR, 0.93 mu g/m3), and 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03-1.09; P < .001) for sulfate (IQR, 0.40 mu g/m3) over the entire pregnancy. The second trimester was the most susceptible window; for example, aORs for total PM2.5 concentration were 1.07 (95% CI, 1.05-1.09; P < .001) in the first, 1.10 (95% CI, 1.08-1.12; P < .001) in the second, and 1.09 (95% CI, 1.07-1.11; P < .001) in the third trimester. Significantly higher aORs were observed among individuals with lower educational attainment (eg, less than college: aOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.12-1.21 vs college [>= 4 years]: aOR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.06-1.14; P = .03) or income (<50th percentile: aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.14-1.21 vs >= 50th percentile: aOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.16; P = .02) or who were exposed to limited green space (<50th percentile: aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.15-1.23 vs >= 50th percentile: aOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.15; P = .003), more wildfire smoke (>= 50th percentile: aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.16-1.23 vs <50th percentile: aOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.09-1.16; P = .009), or extreme heat (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.42-1.59 vs mild temperature: aOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.09-1.14; P < .001). Conclusions and RelevanceIn this study, exposures to PM2.5 and specific PM2.5 constituents during pregnancy were associated with increased odds of sPTB.

The Journal editors requested that my response to Rice be edited and submitted as a paper to ensure adequate technical review and suggested that the article also add material summarizing the series of exchanges that were published in the Journal. This article suggests that significant differences exist between various summaries of the offsite impact of the Trinity Nuclear Test and offers that Trinity might be the largest nuclear accident in terms of the impact on uninvolved civilians who were downwind following the test. It suggests areas for further study to resolve these significant differences. It also asserts that until the estimated exposures of downwind residents are resolved and an appropriate study is made of infant deaths following the Trinity Nuclear Test, the issue of infant mortality remains an unanswered, 80-y-old question.";"accidents, nuclear; atmospheric testing; exposure, population; nuclear weapons; ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES; GENETIC-DISEASE; LIKELIHOOD; POPULATIONS; DOWNWIND; FALLOUT; SHONKA";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

During humanitarian events, the reproduction of maternal mortality figures by the media is common, and are often based on inaccurate reports. In light of such uncertainties and challenges, the aim of this article was to review and appraise the methodology and data collection tools used to measure MMR in humanitarian settings. A critical review of both grey and peer-review publications was conducted, focussing on articles published from January 1995 until December 2016. In the final review, articles that provided an estimate of MMR from a humanitarian setting were included. The assessment of study quality was based on an adapted framework for the quality of mortality studies in humanitarian settings. Overall, 13 peer-review publications and one grey publication were included in the final review. These were grouped according to settings: camp, clinic, household and census. Studies varied in their definition of MMR, and few studies objectively defined the humanitarian setting. Household-based studies were based on retrospective designs and on the recall of surviving family members. Although many studies attempted to purposively sample the populations afflicted, there was substantial evidence of selection bias; few studies were able to confirm the maternal deaths through medical certificates, or attempted to visit homes to re-inquire about deaths using verbal autopsy. The variation in methods and tools applied suggest that maternal mortality estimates are more likely to be markedly different from the true unknown level. The implications are that a standardized methodology and tools are necessary: that are consistent in definition, use a representative sample where possible, attempt to triangulate and validate data sources, and reconfirm deaths through household visits with informant interviews.";"Maternal mortality; MMR; conflict; humanitarian; humanitarian setting; methodology; methods; ARMED CONFLICT; REFUGEE; HEALTH; DEATH; OUTCOMES; PERIOD; BIRTH; CHILD; 1ST";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Following the 7.7 magnitude earthquake, extensive destruction and significant loss of life occurred across 10 provinces. This study aims to analyze the outcomes and share the surgical and radiologic algorithm applied to live, trauma-affected pregnant patients who were referred to the obstetrics and gynecology emergency department of our hospital following the earthquake. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study. The study included pregnant patients affected by the earthquake who were admitted to and/or referred to the obstetrics and gynecology emergency department of a tertiary hospital between February 6 and March 6, 2023. Demographic data, trauma-related findings, surgical details, and obstetric outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 58 pregnant earthquake victims were evaluated. The mean gestational age was 22.24 +/- 10.59 weeks. The most common obstetric complaint was pelvic pain or contractions (36.3%). Eleven patients gave birth, two via vaginal delivery and nine via cesarean section. The mean gestational age at delivery was 32.81 weeks. Curettage was performed in three patients, and hysterotomy in one patient. There were six live births and five stillbirths. In patients undergoing cesarean section, a midline incision was made. After delivery, the uterus was sutured, and intra-abdominal organs were evaluated. In cases of pelvic or other fractures, intraoperative scope devices were used. When necessary, patients were consulted by general surgery and orthopedics departments and were transferred to either the ward or the intensive care unit, depending on their clinical condition. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound has become the primary diagnostic tool for emergency evaluation in pregnant women. For earthquake victims who lack access to radiological assessment and require rapid clinical decisions, the recommended surgical approaches, particularly midline incisions, and intraoperative evaluations (such as the use of intraoperative scope after delivery) can be life-saving for both the baby and the mother.";"Earthquake; pregnancy; trauma; cesarean surgery in trauma; TRAUMA; OUTCOMES; INJURY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Significant public health questions surrounding its effects remain, including the impact on cardiovascular disease and maternal health. Using atmospheric chemical transport modeling, we examined general air quality with and without wildland fire smoke PM2.5. The 24-h average concentration of PM2.5 from all sources in 12-km gridded output from all sources in California (2007-2013) was 4.91 mu g/m(3). The average concentration of fire-PM2.5 in California by year was 1.22 mu g/m(3) (25% of total PM2.5). The fire-PM2.5 daily mean was estimated at 4.40 mu g/m(3) in a high fire year (2008). Based on the model-derived fire-PM2.5 data, 97.4% of California's population lived in a county that experienced at least one episode of high smoke exposure (smokewave) from 2007-2013. Photochemical model predictions of wildfire impacts on daily average PM2.5 carbon (organic and elemental) compared to rural monitors in California compared well for most years but tended to over-estimate wildfire impacts for 2008 (2.0 mu g/m(3) bias) and 2013 (1.6 mu g/m(3) bias) while underestimating for 2009 (-2.1 mu g/m(3) bias). The modeling system isolated wildfire and PM2.5 from other sources at monitored and unmonitored locations, which is important for understanding population exposure in health studies. Further work is needed to refine model predictions of wildland fire impacts on air quality in order to increase confidence in the model for future assessments. Atmospheric modeling can be a useful tool to assess broad geographic scale exposure for epidemiologic studies and to examine scenario-based health impacts.";"wildland fire; air quality; exposure; particulate matter; geospatial analysis; public health; chemical transport model; atmospheric modeling; epidemiology; AIR-POLLUTION EXPOSURE; FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; HYPERTENSIVE DISORDERS; WILDFIRE SMOKE; URBAN INTERFACE; QUALITY IMPACTS; BIRTH-WEIGHT; WESTERN US; SATELLITE; PM2.5";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The impact is long lasting, extending beyond the disaster year. I provide suggestive evidence of the potential mechanisms driving these effects, namely, lower GDP and vaccination rates among children, along with an increased maternal mortality and disease incidence in low-income countries due to disasters. Using an endogenous measure of disasters based on damage records from insurance data leads to severe underestimation of the disaster impact.

Design: Epidemiological analysis of sub-national and national surveys with related data. Setting: Data from Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe, compiled and analysed under UNICEF auspices. Subjects: Secondary data: children 0-5 years for weight-for-age; HIV prevalence data from various sources especially antenatal clinic surveillance. Results: Child nutritional status as measured by prevalence of underweight deteriorated from 2001 onwards in all countries except Lesotho, with very substantial increases in some provinces/districts (e.g. from 5 to 20% in Maputo (Mozambique, 1997-2002), 17 to 32% in Copperbelt (Zambia, 1999-2001/2) and 11 to 26% in Midlands province (Zimbabwe, 1999-2002)). Greater deterioration in underweight occurred in better-off areas. Areas with higher HIV/AIDS prevalences had (so far) lower malnutrition rates (and infant mortality rates), presumably because more modern areas - with greater reliance on trade and wage employment - have more HIV/AIDS. Areas with higher HIV/AIDS showed more deterioration in child nutrition. A significant area-level interaction was found of HIV/AIDS with the drought period, associated with particularly rapid deterioration in nutritional status. Conclusions: First, the most vulnerable may be households in more modern areas, nearer towns, to whom resources need to be directed. Second, the causes of this vulnerability need to be investigated. Third, HIV/AIDS amplifies the effect of drought on nutrition, so rapid and effective response will be crucial if drought strikes again. Fourth, expanded nutritional surveillance is now needed to monitor and respond to deteriorating trends. Finally, with or without drought, new means are needed of bringing help, comfort and assistance to the child population.";"HIV/AIDS; child nutrition; underweight; weight-for-age; drought; food security; southern Africa; Lesotho; Malawi; Mozambique; Swaziland; Zambia; Zimbabwe";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

OBJECTIVE To determine whether infants of mothers with at least 1 positive ZIKV test show differences in cognitive scores at ages 3 to 6 months and ages 9 to 12 months. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study recruited infants enrolled in existing ZIKV study cohorts associated with the Maternal-Infant Studies Center and the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium at the University of Puerto Rico and from the broader San Juan metropolitan area. The study took place at the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium at the University of Puerto Rico. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling if their mothers underwent ZIKV testing prenatally and were at the target ages during the study period. Infants who were born preterm (<36 weeks' gestational age), with low birth weight (<2500 g), or with a known genetic disorder were excluded. Infants were tested from ages 3 to 6 months or ages 9 to 12 months from May 2018 to April 2019. Data analysis was performed from March to April 2019. EXPOSURES Zika virus status was measured prenatally and in the early postnatal period using real-time polymerase chain reaction or a ZIKV IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The infants' development was assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (translated to Spanish and adapted for Puerto Rico), and assessors were blinded to each infant's ZIKV status. RESULTS A total of 65 study participants were included. The mean (SD) age of the infants at the time of cognitive testing was 8.98 (3.19) months. Most of the infants were white (55 [84.6%]) and Puerto Rican (64 [98.5%]); 38 of the infants were male (58.5%). General cognitive and domain-specific scores did not differ significantly between prenatally ZIKV-positive and ZIKV-negative infants except for receptive language score (mean difference = 5.52; t = 2.10; P = .04). Exposure to ZIKV (B = -5.69; beta = -0.26 [95% CI -11.01 to -0.36]; P = .04) and a measure of Hurricane Maria exposure (time without water, B = -0.05; beta = -0.27 [95% CI, -0.10 to -0.01]; P = .03) were both independently and significantly associated with receptive language scores after adjusting for key confounders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although infants exposed to ZIKV prenatally showed unaffected motor and visually mediated cognitive development, they did show deficits in receptive language scores. Receptive language skills were also associated with the degree of exposure to Hurricane Maria, with those who spent more time without water after the hurricane having lower receptive language scores.";"PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-9; PRENATAL MATERNAL STRESS; SPANISH VERSION; DEPRESSION; INFECTION; VALIDATION; MECHANISMS; EMPLOYMENT; PREGNANCY; OUTBREAK";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The new supranational money would be created against domestic earning assets of the Fed and the ECB and its quantity would be demand-driven. Our proposal is not an agreement on exchange rates, which while possible is not essential to the functioning of the SBM. NICU would not hold open positions in assets denominated in national currency and consequently would not bear exchange rate risk.

To delve into the effects of these disasters on livelihood and healthcare challenges, a mixed-method study was undertaken in a riverine-island near a major river of Bangladesh.Methodology Between February 15th and February 28th, 2023, a cross-sectional study was conducted on an island in Bangladesh. The quantitative method involved conducting a survey of 442 households, with a total of 2921 participants. Additionally, 10 in-depth interviews and 10 key-informant interviews were conducted using semi-structured guidelines. Qualitative interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a thematic analysis. Triangulation was employed in this study through the integration of qualitative and quantitative analysis, resulting in the presentation of findings that offer an in-depth comprehension of the phenomenon being investigated.Results River erosions and floods are common and recurring natural disasters that significantly impact the lives of the riverine island inhabitants. These disasters often disrupted their livelihoods, forced many residents to endure substandard living conditions or relocated during flood events. The island faced a low diagnostic prevalence of chronic diseases (e.g., 5.1% of adults were hypertension and 2.5% are diabetes) because of the absence of diagnostic facilities and a shortage of certified doctors. A significant number of chronic illness people in the community turned to alternative medicine sources (39.3%) such as homeopathy, Kabiraj, and Ayurvedic medicine, especially it gets increased during periods of natural disasters. Moreover, reproductive aged women revealed that 79.4% of them gave birth at home, with 6.0% of these home deliveries resulting in miscarriage or infant death. The destruction of crops, unstable job opportunities, an inadequate educational system, and a deficient healthcare delivery system exacerbated the hardships faced by the population affected by these disasters.Conclusion The failure to seek treatment for chronic diseases and undiagnosed diseases is a significant health issue among the aging adults on the island. Island residents face the challenge of establishing effective prevention strategies for the well-being of older adults especially at the period of natural disasters. It is crucial for the government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to collaborate to prevent the negative effects of floods and river erosions. This should include efforts to enhance the quality of education, healthcare services, job opportunities, and financial assistance for rebuilding homes.";"CLIMATE-CHANGE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

China provides a unique context for studying early life conditions due to its limited migration, large-scale policy interventions, and distinct gender norms. Existing studies show that early life shocks have persistent negative effects on health, education, and labor market outcomes. In contrast, targeted interventions, such as pollution control, clean water provision, and health insurance expansion, significantly improve human capital, particularly for disadvantaged children. Gender norms also shape both the costs of shocks and the benefits of policies.

Yet high tidal volumes are required to overcome dead space. In an experimental arrangement we tested whether reduction of dead space might reduce ventilation requirements and thus reduce volutrauma in preterm infants. Materials and methods: The time required to eliminate CO2 by standardized mechanical ventilation from a preterm infant's test lung flooded with CO2 was measured. Four different Y-pieces and flow sensor combinations were tested with and without a device for closed suction: Y-piece without flow sensor; integrated flow sensor; small dead-space flow sensor; and a new dead-space free-flow sensor for preterm infants. CO2 concentrations were measured by a capnograph. Mean CO2 elimination times (+/- SD) were compared. Results: Mean CO2 elimination time was 37.5 s (+/- 1.18 s) with and 37.4 s (+/- 0.97 s) without closed suction device for the Y-piece without flow sensor, 47.7 s (+/- 0.82 s) and 45.5 s (+/- 1.18 s) for the integrated flow sensor, 42.5 s (+/- 1.27 s) and 41.1 s (+/- 0.99 s) for the small dead-space flow sensor and 38.3 s (+/- 1.16 s) and 36.8 s (+/- 0.79 s) for the dead-space free-flow sensor. Conclusion: CO2 elimination time with and without closed suction device was nearly identical for the Y-piece without flow sensor and for the dead-space free-flow sensor.

METHODS: Using birth certificate data for NY residents (n = 1660,401 births), we estimated risk of low birthweight (LBW: < 2500 g) and preterm birth (< 37 weeks) one week after September 11th versus three weeks before, and for 10 four-week intervals post-disaster versus these intervals in the two previous years. To corroborate regression results, we used time-series analysis. RESULTS: One week after September 11th in NYC, we observed an adjusted odds of 1.44 for births < 1500 g (P = 0.07) and 1.67 for births 1500-1999 g (P = 0.01), but a decreased odds of 2000-2499 g. We found no immediate change in LBW upstate or preterm in either location. In extended analyses, we found, in both locations, increased odds of < 1500-g births around New Year and 33-36 weeks post-disaster and decreased odds of moderate preterm for several weeks post-disaster. Time-series analyses yielded similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: The events of September 11, 2001 in NYC were associated with immediate increases in births < 2000 g, slightly delayed decreased preterm delivery, and delayed increases in LBW among infants exposed periconception or in the first two trimesters.

With the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) deadline of 2015 drawing nearer, the likelihood that Haiti will achieve MDG's 4 and 5 of reducing child and maternal mortality by two-thirds and three-quarters, respectively, by the end of this target year, remain questionable. In particular, the destruction inflicted on the country's health care system and health infrastructure by the 2010 earthquake have already resulted in a slowing of these gains and could potentially threaten an actual reversal of these trends. The country's Soins Obst,tricaux Gratuits and Soins Infantiles Gratuits schemes established in 2008 and 2010, which provide free health care to women, newborns and children under 5, represent examples of measures that will need to be sustained and scaled up if the country is to meet its MDG 4 and 5 targets. The Haitian government's endorsement of an increased continuum of care approach to maternal and newborn health will also be vital for future initiatives. Post-quake public health and social service reconstruction efforts will need to incorporate maternal and child health-friendly services into their designs. It also remains critical that international donors continue to meet their pledges to Haiti. The Haitian government should also take more strides to clearly delineate the maternal and child health interventions it implements, both in order to facilitate greater national learning, as well as to improve the likelihood of future replication.";"Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5; Child mortality; Maternal mortality; Haiti reconstruction; Donor support";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Infant and maternal mortality, preterm birth, and instances of increased developmental and physical defects are related to environmental exposures (e.g., pesticides, lead in water, wildfire smoke), dietary additives, and lack of access to adequate healthcare. More frequently people of color and other under-served groups, are affected by historical inequality and unconscious bias. Compounding these disparities, research into these issues and efforts to address them are poorly supported.MethodsThe speakers in this symposium presented evidence for health disparities within communities of color to foster research aimed at identifying toxic levels of potentially hazardous dietary chemicals, or exposures in the pediatric population can focus on addressing the current inadequacy of translating scientific findings into enforceable policies.ResultsThe disparities discussed within this symposium highlighted key areas in desperate need of policy reform. In the United States, regulatory exposure levels have been established for lead exposures but frequently exceed these limits without mitigation. Neural tube defects can be prevented by a simple dietary solution such as fortification of staple foods with folic acid. Recent literature on gender as a social determinant of health has determined women suffer more negative health consequences due to social attitudes.ConclusionsUltimately, this symposium provided an understanding of the experience of disadvantaged and marginalized persons during pregnancy, illustrated the disparities that exist in reproductive health, and described the need to address and prevent them.";"folic acid; health disparities; lead; maternal and pediatric health; people of color; NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS; THYROID-FUNCTION; EXPOSURE; CHILDREN; DISORDERS; PREGNANCY; CHEMICALS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Ambient pollutant concentrations, emission sources, baseline health conditions, and population sizes and distributions are all important factors that need to be taken into account to quantify local health burdens. Objectives: To determine health impacts from ambient air pollution concentrations in the United States that exceed the levels recommended by the American Thoracic Society. Methods: Using a methodology that has been well established in previous ""Health of the Air"" reports, this study provides policyrelevant estimates for every monitored county and city in the United States for the adverse health impacts of outdoor pollution concentrations using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency design values for years 2018-2020. Additionally, for the first time, the report includes adverse birth outcomes as well as estimates of health impacts specifically attributable to wildland fires using an exposure dataset generated through CommunityMultiscale Air Quality simulations. Results: The adverse health burdens attributable to air pollution occur across the entire age spectrum, including adverse birth outcomes (10,660 preterm and/or low-weight births; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3,180-18,330), in addition to mortality impacts (21,300 avoidable deaths; 95% CI, 16,180-26,200), lung cancer incidence (3,000 new cases; 95% CI, 1,550-4,390), multiple types of cardiovascular and respiratorymorbidity (748,660 events; 95% CI, 326,050-1,057,080), and adversely impacted days (52.4million days; 95% CI, 7.9-92.4million days).

We ground our work in the conceptual framework that vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Making extensive use of geographic information systems and publicly available data, we constructed 13 spatial layers to reflect the multi-dimensionality of vulnerability. Layers reflect for example, changes in climatic extremes, flood risk, vegetation cover, access to infrastructure (road density) and health services (distance to hospitals), as well as various socioeconomic (wealth level, employment rates, remittances, literacy rate) and demographic (infant mortality) characteristics. Following normalization, we constructed an inverse variance weighted index of canton-level climate vulnerability. We confirmed the validity of our climate vulnerability index through correlation with disaster damage data. We find the strongest climate vulnerability not only in the rural, agricultural producing border cantons (Los Chiles, Matina, Talamanca, Buenos Aires), but also for a few central urban cantons (Tibas, San Jose). Projects and interventions in these hot spot cantons may reduce sensitivity through strengthening hydrological infrastructure and economic development, while adaptive capacity may be improved through addressing barriers of remittance transfer, and via public health programs.";"Climate Vulnerability; Vulnerability Mapping; Sub-national; Climate Change Index; Climate Risk; Costa Rica; FOOD SECURITY; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CHANGE IMPACTS; EL-NINO; ADAPTATION; MIGRATION; DROUGHT; SYSTEMS; PERSPECTIVE; VARIABILITY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The healthcare programs have been well accepted and utilized by the people as the literacy rate is more than 90% for both men and women. Public health midwives form the backbone of MCH services and provide frontline reproductive health care. More than 98% of deliveries occur in hospitals and are attended by midwives. Furthermore, 85% of women in Sri Lanka deliver in facilities served by specialist obstetricians/gynecologists. The Sri Lanka College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists plays a leading role by assisting the Family Health Bureau in making policies and guidelines, training staff, and acting as team leaders for maternity care services.

Deductive analysis followed a coding structure that was generated from two resilience scales. Themes that emerged during inductive analysis were also coded. The main themes that emerged described the women's challenging experiences: fears for themselves and their offspring, fire-related and past trauma, and relationship changes. Resilience characteristics and practices also emerged from the writings and mirrored those found in the literature: (a) posttraumatic growth, (b) adaptability, (c) emotional/social connectedness, (d) composure, and (e) reasoning.

WTC dust was found to consist predominantly (95%) of coarse particles and contained pulverized cement, glass fibers, asbestos, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polychlorinated furans and dioxins. Airborne particulate levels were highest immediately after the attack and declined thereafter. Particulate levels decreased sharply with distance from the WTC. Dust pH was highly alkaline (pH 9.0-11.0). Mice exposed to WTC dust showed only moderate pulmonary inflammation but marked bronchial hyperractivity. Evaluation of 10,116 firefighters showed exposure-related. P increases in cough and bronchial hyperreactivity. Evaluation of 183 cleanup workers showed new-onset cough (33%), wheeze (18%), and phlegm production (24%). Increased frequency of new-onset cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath were also observed in community residents. Follow-up of 182 pregnant women who were either inside or near the WTC on I I September showed a 2-fold increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. In summary, environmental exposures after the WTC disaster were associated with significant adverse effects on health. The high alkalinity of WTC dust produced bronchial hyperreactivity, persistent cough, and increased risk of asthma. Plausible causes of the observed increase in SGA infants include maternal exposures to PAH and particulates.

However, the burden of stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM2.5 is unknown. In low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is a co-occurrence of high baseline stillbirth rates and frequent firestorms, which may lead to a geographic disparity. Across 54 LMICs, we conducted a self-matched case-control study, making stillbirths comparable to the corresponding livebirths in terms of time-invariant characteristics (e. g., genetics) and duration of gestational exposure. We established a joint-exposure-response function (JERF) by simultaneously associating stillbirth with fire-and non-fire-sourced PM2.5 concentrations, which were estimated by fusing multi-source data, such as chemical transport model simulations and satellite observations. During 2000-2014, 35,590 pregnancies were selected from multiple Demographic and Health Surveys. In each mother, a case of stillbirth was compared to her livebirth(s) based on gestational exposure to fire-sourced PM2.5. We further applied the JERF to assess stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM2.5 in 136 non-Western countries. The disparity was evaluated using the Gini index. The risk of stillbirth increased by 17.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-35.7%) per 10 & mu;g/m3 increase in fire-sourced PM2.5. In 2014, referring to a minimum-risk exposure level of 10 & mu;g/m3, total and fire-sourced PM2.5 contributed to 922,860 (95% CI: 578,451-1,183,720) and 49,951 (95% CI: 3,634-92,629) stillbirths, of which 10% were clustered within the 6.4% and 0.6% highest-exposure pregnancies, respectively.

However, present systems lack adequate surge capacity for neonatal and pediatric mass critical care. In this document, we outline the present reality and suggest alternative approaches. Methods: In May 2008, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care published guidance on provision of mass critical care to adults. Acknowledging that the critical care needs of children during disasters were unaddressed by this effort, a 17-member Steering Committee, assembled by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education with guidance from members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, convened in April 2009 to determine priority topic areas for pediatric emergency mass critical care recommendations. Steering Committee members established subcommittees by topic area and performed literature reviews of MEDLINE and Ovid databases. The Steering Committee produced draft outlines through consensus-based study of the literature and convened October 6-7, 2009, in New York, NY, to review and revise each outline. Eight draft documents were subsequently developed from the revised outlines as well as through searches of MEDLINE updated through March 2010. The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts from diverse public health, medical, and disaster response fields, convened in Atlanta, GA, on March 29-30, 2010. Feedback on each manuscript was compiled and the Steering Committee revised each document to reflect expert input in addition to the most current medical literature. Task Force Recommendations: States and regions (facilitated by federal partners) should review current emergency operations and devise appropriate plans to address the population-based needs of infants and children in large-scale disasters. Action at the state, regional, and federal levels should address legal, operational, and information systems to provide effective pediatric mass critical care through: 1) predisaster/mass casualty planning, management, and assessment with input from child health professionals; 2) close cooperation, agreements, public-private partnerships, and unique delivery systems; and 3) use of existing public health data to assess pediatric populations at risk and to model graded response plans based on increasing patient volume and acuity.

Three of the eight Millennium Development Goals are directly related to reproductive and sexual health while mental disorders make up three of the ten leading causes of disease burden in low and middle-income countries. Among mental disorders, depression and anxiety are two of the most prevalent. In the context of slower progress in achieving Millennium Development Goals in developing countries and the ever-increasing man-made and natural disasters in these areas, it is important to understand the association between reproductive health and mental health among women with post-disaster experiences. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with a sample of 387 women of reproductive age (15-49 years) randomly selected from the October 2005 earthquake affected areas of Pakistan. Data on reproductive health was collected using the Centers for Disease Control reproductive health assessment toolkit. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, while earthquake experiences were captured using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. The association of either depression or anxiety with socio-demographic variables, earthquake experiences, reproductive health and access to health facilities was estimated using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Post-earthquake reproductive health events together with economic deprivation, lower family support and poorer access to health care facilities explained a significant proportion of differences in the experiencing of clinical levels of depression and anxiety. For instance, women losing resources for subsistence, separation from family and experiencing reproductive health events such as having a stillbirth, having had an abortion, having had abnormal vaginal discharge or having had genital ulcers, were at significant risk of depression and anxiety. Conclusion: The relationship between women's post-earthquake mental health and reproductive health, socio-economic status, and health care access is complex and explained largely by the socio-cultural role of women. It is suggested that interventions that consider gender differences and that are culturally appropriate are likely to reduce the incidence.";"Reproductive Health; Mental Health; Disaster; Depression; Anxiety; Earthquake; Access to Health Facilities; Pakistan; HOPKINS SYMPTOM CHECKLIST-25; SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED INFECTION; HARVARD TRAUMA QUESTIONNAIRE; COMMON MENTAL-DISORDERS; SCREENING INSTRUMENT; STRESS; PREGNANCY; PREVALENCE; DISASTER; ABORTION";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

With growing evidence that treating maternal first trimester primary cytomegalovirus infections with valacyclovir reduces vertical transmission, universal screening may become an important tool in congenital cytomegalovirus prevention. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the cost-effectiveness of a universal screening approach for maternal cytomegalovirus in the first trimester of pregnancy followed by valacyclovir treatment in positive cases for prevention of the sequelae of congenital cytomegalovirus. STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare outcomes of universal screening and subsequent valacyclovir treatment in a theoretical cohort of 2,869,141 individuals, the estimated number of pregnant people in the United States who receive prenatal care by the first trimester. Individuals found to be immunoglobulin G positive, immunoglobulin M positive, and to have low immunoglobulin G avidity were considered to have primary cytomegalovirus infection and received valacyclovir. Outcomes included cases of vertical cytomegalovirus transmission, abortions, stillbirths, neonatal deaths, cases of hearing loss, cases of neurodevelopmental disabilities, costs, and quality-adjusted life years. Model inputs were derived from literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed via tornado analysis, univariable sensitivity analysis, and multivariable sensitivity analysis with Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: In our study, universal screening in the first trimester for primary cytomegalovirus and subsequent treatment with valacyclovir positive cases decreased adverse outcomes by preventing 2898 vertical transmissions, 94 abortions, 19 stillbirths, 11 neonatal deaths, 460 cases of hearing loss, and 263 cases of neurodevelopmental disability. Universal screening and subsequent treatment was the dominant strategy as saved 242.2 million dollars and led to 3437 additional quality-adjusted life years. Tornado analysis demonstrated that there were no threshold values which would change the model results, when all variables were varied across a predetermined range. Univariable sensitivity analyses demonstrated that even with decreasing specificity of screening tests, decreasing maternal utility of neonatal hearing loss, and increasing the price screening up to 17 times the current cost, universal screening remained the cost-effective strategy.

The knowledge of the impact of climate change on health is expanding rapidly. However, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the impact of climate change on the interlinked pregnancy, perinatal and infant periods. Hence, the objective of this study was to provide an overview of the effects of changing weather and climate hazards on maternal and infant health during pregnancy, the perinatal period and infancy.Methods We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed original articles and reviews found in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, Global Health and WHO regional databases on the subject between January 2000 and May 2025. The included articles were in the English language, detailed exposure to climate change hazards during pregnancy, the perinatal period and up to 1 year of age in the child, with an outcome related to health.Results In total, 596 reviews and original articles were included in the analysis. Our findings demonstrate large differences in the number and types of studies for each climate-related hazard. Direct health effects from rising temperatures and extreme weather events, as well as indirect health effects such as infectious diseases, food insecurity, forced migration and socioeconomic changes due to climate change, have clear negative consequences for pregnant women and infants.Conclusions There is a large evidence base showcasing the harmful impact of climate change on pregnant women and infants through a variety of pathways. Action is urgently needed at all levels to address climate change and there is a need to implement large-scale mitigation and adaptation efforts that protect the health and well-being of pregnant women and infants everywhere.";"Infant; Child Health; Health Policy; Endocrinology; MATERNAL EXPOSURE; PRETERM BIRTH; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; DISASTER EXPOSURE; CHILD HEALTH; OUTCOMES; DROUGHT; FLOOD; HEAT; DEPRESSION";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

A further misconception was to totalize both Schreber as person and the content of his book as psychotic, controverted by the fact that Schreber recovered by 1897 and the book is a creative essay with a profound moral message. Schreber's hermaphroditic fantasies were neither homosexual desires toward psychiatrist Flechsig nor morbid delusions but images of an identification with or compassion for his wife who suffered repeated miscarriages and stillbirths. The author revisits the description, diagnosis, dynamics, and deontology of Schreber's story from the perspective of dramatology and narratology and adds new information and insights.

In contrast to some cooperative breeders, subordinate female meerkats are physiologically able to reproduce and occasionally do so successfully; their attempts are more frequently 'suppressed' via eviction or infanticide by the dominant female. Spontaneous abortion and neonatal loss occur with some regularity, further negatively impacting reproductive success. Here, we compared the reproductive outcomes and endocrine profiles, including of serum progesterone (P-4), serum estradiol (E-2), and fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCm), of dominant and subordinate dams residing within their clans in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa. Our study spanned years of drought, which reduced insect abundance and represented a substantial environmental stressor. Meerkat pregnancies were identified at mid-term and culminated either in spontaneous abortions or full-term deliveries, after which pups were either lost prior to emergence from the natal den (usually within 2 days of birth) or emerged at 2-3 weeks. Neonatal loss exceeded fetal loss for all females, and contributed to narrowing the status-related disparity in female reproductive output seen during less arid periods. Although E-2 concentrations were significantly lower in subordinate than dominant females, they were sufficient to support gestation. Absolute E-2 concentrations may owe to androgenic precursors that also attain highest concentrations in dominant dams and may mediate aggression underlying female reproductive skew. Pregnancies terminating in fetal loss were marked by significantly lower 134 concentrations in mid-gestation and modestly lower E-2 concentrations overall. Consistently high fGCm concentrations further increased across trimesters, particularly (but not consistently) in subordinates and in aborted pregnancies. Environmental stressor may modulate reproductive outcomes in meerkats through their influence on sex steroids and their effects on intragroup competition. The social and eco-physiological factors affecting intraspecific variation in reproductive output, even in obligate cooperative breeders, may be most apparent during extreme conditions, reflecting the benefits of long-term studies for assessing the impact of climate change.";"Cooperative breeding; Social dominance; Reproductive and stress hormones; Fetal and neonatal mortality; Reproductive success; Climate change; FECAL GLUCOCORTICOID LEVELS; EARLY FETAL LOSS; LONG-TERM FIELD; SURICATA-SURICATTA; SUBORDINATE REPRODUCTION; PHYSIOLOGICAL SUPPRESSION; TRIGGERED ABORTION; SEXUAL SELECTION; PRENATAL STRESS; HEAT-STRESS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

It is brought on by global warming due in large part to increasing levels of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity, including burning fossil fuels (carbon dioxide), animal husbandry (methane from manure), industry emissions (ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide), vehicle/factory exhaust, and chlorofluorocarbon aerosols that trap extra heat in the earth's atmosphere. Resulting extremes of weather give rise to wildfires, air pollution, changes in ecology, and floods. These in turn result in displacement of populations, family disruption, violence, and major impacts on water quality and availability, food security, public health and economic infrastructures, and limited abilities for civil society to maintain citizen safety. Climate change also has direct impacts on human health and well-being. Particularly vulnerable populations are affected, including women, pregnant women, children, the disabled, and the elderly, who comprise the majority of the poor globally. Additionally, the effects of climate change disproportionally affect disadvantaged communities, including low income and communities of color, and lower-income countries that are at highest risk of adverse impacts when disasters occur due to inequitable distribution of resources and their socioeconomic status. The climate crisis is tilting the risk balance unfavorably for women's sexual and reproductive health and rights as well as newborn and child health. Obstetrician/gynecologists have the unique opportunity to raise awareness, educate, and advocate for mitigation strategies to reverse climate change affecting our patients and their families. This article puts climate change in the context of women's reproductive health as a public health issue, a social justice issue, a human rights issue, an economic issue, a political issue, and a gender issue that needs our attention now for the health and well-being of this and future generations. FIGO joins a broad coalition of international researchers and the medical community in stating that the current climate crisis presents an imminent health risk to pregnant people, developing fetuses, and reproductive health, and recognizing that we need society-wide solutions, government policies, and global cooperation to address and reduce contributors, including fossil fuel production, to climate change.";"advocacy; climate change; education; environment; reproduction; women's health; FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; AIR-POLLUTION EXPOSURE; PRETERM BIRTH; TEMPERATURE EXPOSURE; PREGNANCY; RISK; OUTCOMES; ASSOCIATION; IMPACTS; JUSTICE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Methods Preschool children (n = 163, mean age = 3.19, 85.5% racial and ethnic minorities) and their parents (n = 151) were evaluated annually at ages 2-5 to assess the emergence of psychopathology using the Preschool Age Psychopathological Assessment (PAPA), a parent-report structured diagnostic interview developed for preschool-age children. Sixty-six (40.5%) children were exposed to Sandy Storm (SS) in utero and 97 (59.5%) were not. Survival analysis evaluated patterns of onset and estimated cumulative risks of psychopathology among exposed and unexposed children, in total and by sex. Analyses were controlled for the severity of objective and subjective SS-related stress, concurrent family stress, and demographic and psychosocial confounders, such as maternal age, race, SES, maternal substance use, and normative prenatal stress. Results Exposure to SS in utero was associated with a substantial increase in depressive disorders (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 16.9, p = .030), anxiety disorders (HR = 5.1, p < .0001), and attention-deficit/disruptive behavioral disorders (HR = 3.4, p = .02). Diagnostic rates were elevated for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; HR = 8.5, p = .004), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; HR = 5.5, p = .01), oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD; HR = 3.8, p = .05), and separation-anxiety disorder (SAD; HR = 3.5, p = .001).

Conclusions The findings demonstrate that in utero exposure to a major weather-related disaster (SS) was associated with increased risk for psychopathology in children and provided evidence of distinct psychopathological outcomes as a function of sex.

The mostly negative water budget of the Kabul Basin is the result of strong evaporation which leads to an increase in salt and also of some undesirable constituents, e.g. borate. Several years of drought have aggravated this problem. The shallow groundwater in the city has received tremendous amounts of pollution due to a lack of proper waste disposal and sewage treatment. Common indicators are elevated concentrations of nutrients such as nitrate and faecal bacteria. The high infant mortality can at least partially be attributed to the insufficient water hygiene.

Contextual, locally driven data are required to elucidate country needs, develop effective interventions, and guide policy decisions. Objective: We employ qualitative methodology to describe barriers faced and solutions proposed by front-line obstetric providers in Bihar - a poor, populous Indian state where maternal mortality exceeds the national average. We aim to make locally driven recommendations for ongoing policy work in India to strengthen the country's blood transfusion system. Methods: From February to May 2016, two researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 obstetric providers across Bihar. Snowball sampling was employed until thematic saturation was reached. Following immersion into de-identified texts and dual codebook development, a primary analyst completed topical coding, and a secondary analyst confirmed reproducibility. Results: Providers report that pervasive banked blood shortages force hospitals to require replacement donation, but patients' families often cannot or will not donate. Providers wait one to six hours for blood, depending on availability of staff and supplies, blood bank proximity, and the ability of the patient being treated to navigate the system. Providers feel forced to refer their patients, often to distant, poorly equipped centers. Providers identify donor education, improved infrastructure, and improved local coordination as focus areas for intervention. Conclusions: A multi-stakeholder approach that aims to increase blood donation through community education, mitigate limited infrastructure through short-term workarounds, and improve local-level coordination through state support and policy change is required in Bihar.

In savanna baboons, high-ranking females are the most profitable targets of infanticide or feticide, because their offspring have higher survival rates and their daughters reach sexual maturity at a younger age. However, such patterns may be obscured by environmental stressors that are known to exacerbate fetal losses, especially in lower-ranking females. Using 30 years of data on wild olive baboons (Papio anubis) in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, we found evidence that rapidly-rising immigrant males induced miscarriages in high-ranking females outside of drought conditions. However, miscarriage rates were largely reversed during prolonged periods of low rainfall, suggesting that low-ranking females are particularly vulnerable to low food availability and social instability. Infanticide did not emerge as a recurrent male strategy in this population, likely because of the protective behavior of resident males towards vulnerable juveniles.";"";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Independent variables included spatially explicit measures of natural processes and human presence as well as country-level socioeconomic measures. Our dependent variable was the carcass ratio, the ratio of dead elephants to live plus dead elephants, which is an index of recent elephant mortality. Carcass ratios are inversely proportional to population growth rates of elephants over the 4 yr prior to a survey. At the scale of survey strata (n = 275, median area = 1,222 km(2)), we found strong negative associations for carcass ratios with vegetation greenness at the time of the survey, overseas development aid to the country, and distance to the nearest international border. At the scale of ecosystems (n = 42, median area = 12,085 km(2)), carcass ratios increased with drought frequency and decreased with human density and overseas development aid to the country.

Although increased vasopressinase is associated with placental volume, the regulation of placental growth in the later stage of pregnancy is not well known. Case presentation: A 16-year-old pregnant woman was urgently transferred to our hospital because of threatened premature labor when the Kumamoto earthquakes hit the area where she lived. During her hospitalization, she complained of gradually increasing symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia. The serum level of arginine vasopressin (AVP) was 1.7 pg/mL, which is inconsistent with central DI. The challenge of diagnostic treatment using oral 1-deamino-8-D-AVP (DDAVP) successfully controlled her urine and allowed for normal delivery. DDAVP tablets were not necessary to control her polyuria thereafter. Based on these observations, clinical diagnosis of GDI was confirmed. Pathophysiological analyses revealed that vasopressinase expression was more abundant in the GDI patient's syncytiotrophoblast in placenta compared with that in a control subject. Serum vasopressinase was also observed during gestation and disappeared soon after delivery. Vasopressinase is reportedly identical to oxytocinase or insulin regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), which is an abundant cargo protein associated with the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) storage vesicle. Interestingly, the expression and subcellular localization of GLUT4 appeared to occur in a vasopressinase (IRAP)-dependent manner. Conclusion: Because placental volume may be associated with vasopressinase overproduction in GDI, vasopressinase (IRAP)/GLUT4 association appears to contribute to the growth of placenta in this case.";"Gestational diabetes insipidus; Vasopressinase (=insulin regulated aminopeptidase: IRAP); Glucose transporter 4; PREGNANCY; AMINOPEPTIDASE; GLUT4; PLACENTA";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

These include depression, anxiety, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and/or conduct disorders.

The causal role of prenatal maternal stress on the etiology of the neurodevelopmental disorders is supported by large population cohorts, which have controlled for a wide range of potential confounders, including postnatal maternal mood. More recently, research has begun to explore the biological correlates and mediators of these findings. These studies suggest that the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis plays a role inmediating the effects of maternal stress on the fetal brain. Further, in vivo brain imaging research reports that maternal stress is associated with changes in limbic and frontotemporal networks, and the functional and microstructural connections linking them. The structural changes include cortical thinning and an enlarged amygdala.

We also identified the interaction effects between sociopolitical factor and climate factors for adult and neonatal mortality, while birthrate was not affected by these interactions. When exposed to climate hazards, adult and neonatal livestock mortality rates were significantly higher, while birthrate was significantly lower in social movement period than in peaceful period.

The predictors included political and economic factors, health outcomes, climate change-related variables and membership of political negotiating groups in the UN. Findings For both UN general debate statements and nationally determined contributions, low-and middle-income countries discussed the health impacts of climate change much more than did high-income countries. The most important predictors of engagement were health outcomes (infant mortality, maternal deaths, life expectancy), countries' income levels (gross domestic product per capita), and fossil fuel consumption.

In this review, we aimed to describe the current landscape of available epidemiological evidence on key climate risks on maternal and newborn health (MNH). Methods We sought to identify published systematic and scoping reviews investigating the impact of different climate hazards and air pollution on MNH outcomes. With this in mind, we developed a systematic search strategy based on the concepts of 'climate/air pollution hazards, 'maternal health,' and 'newborn health,' with restrictions to reviews published between 1 January 2010 and 6 February 2023, but without geographical or language restriction. Following full text screening and data extraction, we synthesised the results using narrative synthesis. Results We found 79 reviews investigating the effects of climate hazards on MNH, mainly focussing on outdoor air pollution (n = 47, 59%), heat (n = 24, 30%), and flood/ storm disasters (n = 7, 9%). Most were published after 2015 (n = 60, 76%). These reviews had consistent findings regarding the positive association of exposure to heat and to air pollution with adverse birth outcomes, particularly preterm birth. We found limited evidence for impacts of climate-related food and water security on MNH and did not identify any reviews on climate-sensitive infectious diseases and MNH. Conclusions Climate change could undermine recent improvements in maternal and newborn health. Our review provides an overview of key climate risks to MNH. It could therefore be useful to the MNH community to better understand the MNH needs for each climate hazard and to strengthen discussions on evidence and research gaps and potential actions.

Objective: The aim of this paper is to describe the process of priority-setting, and the strategies, guiding principles, activities, achievements, and lessons learned in these local development efforts from 1990 to 2014 in the Cuatro Santos area, Nicaragua. Methods: Data were derived from project records and a Health and Demographic Surveillance System that was initiated in 2004. The area had 25,893 inhabitants living in 5,966 households in 2014. Results: A participatory process with local stakeholders and community representatives resulted in a long-term strategic plan. Guiding principles were local ownership, political reconciliation, consensus decision-making, social and gender equity, an environmental and public health perspective, and sustainability. Local data were used in workshops with communities to re-prioritise and formulate new goals. The interventions included water and sanitation, house construction, microcredits, environmental protection, school breakfasts, technical training, university scholarships, home gardening, breastfeeding promotion, and maternity waiting homes. During the last decade, the proportion of individuals living in poverty was reduced from 79 to 47%. Primary school enrolment increased from 70 to 98% after the start of the school breakfast program. Under-five mortality was around 50 per 1,000 live births in 1990 and again peaked after Hurricane Mitch and was approaching 20 per 1,000 in 2014. Several of the interventions have been scaled up as national programs. Conclusions: The lessons learned from the Cuatro Santos initiative underline the importance of a bottom- up approach and local ownership of the development process, the value of local data for monitoring and evaluation, and the need for multi-dimensional local interventions to break the cycles of poverty and gain better health and welfare.";"Poverty alleviation; community participation; microcredits; education; water and sanitation; scale-up; under-five mortality; Health and Demographic Surveillance; System; MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS; DEMOGRAPHIC SURVEILLANCE SITE; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS; CHILD HEALTH; UNDER-5 MORTALITY; INFANT-MORTALITY; INCOME COUNTRIES; RURAL NICARAGUA; NEWBORN; PROGRESS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Inspired by neo-Malthusian concerns around resource depletion, scholars have argued that fertility reduction through increased contraceptive use is necessary to protect maternal health, prevent environmental disaster, and promote economic prosperity throughout the Global South. Despite substantial critique from feminist and anticolonial scholars, the scientific evidence behind these arguments has often been treated as established fact. This ostensible scientific consensus on the instrumental benefits of contraceptive use has been marshalled by the global family planning establishment in the wake of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development to justify continued efforts to maximize contraceptive uptake in the Global South. Here, we critically examine the evidence linking high fertility to adverse maternal health, environmental, and economic outcomes and evaluate whether reducing fertility through increased contraceptive use offers an effective strategy to address these challenges. We find the state of the evidence weaker and more conflicted than commonly acknowledged, with many claims relying on small effect sizes and/or unjustified assumptions. While increasing contraceptive uptake and reducing fertility may offer limited, marginal advantages, we argue that family planning cannot effectively address the multidimensional challenges of global poverty, ill health, and environmental degradation. Instead, global health and development should address root causes of these phenomena, while family planning programs must radically refocus on reproductive autonomy.";"Family planning; Fertility; Sustainable development; Population dynamics; Reproductive rights; Maternal health; Environmental protection; Economic growth; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; CONTRACEPTIVE USE; MATERNAL MORTALITY; POPULATION-CONTROL; UNMET NEED; ABORTION; AFRICA; GRAND; MORBIDITY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

While disaster research emphasises risk management for predictable threats and adaptive capacity for unexpected challenges, there is a lack of empirical examination of the impact of adaptive capacity on disaster resilience. This study addresses this gap by identifying three key adaptive capacities - quality of institutions, collaborative governance, and social capital - and examining their effects on COVID-19 resilience outcomes, measured by the ability to reduce excess mortality. Analysing secondary data from 129 nations using partial least squares structural equation modelling, the research finds significant positive effects of institutional quality and social capital on resilience outcomes. Conversely, collaborative governance shows a significant negative association, suggesting potentially intricate impacts beyond initial expectations. The findings highlight the need to enhance institutional quality and social capital to address preparedness gaps and unexpected challenges posed by biological hazards such as COVID-19. Future research should explore collaborative governance using a disaggregated approach that considers the roles of different stakeholders in various disaster phases. Contribution: This study advances disaster research by presenting practical methodologies for operationalising adaptive capacities and empirically examining their effects on disaster resilience. For practitioners and policymakers, it highlights the need to adopt a long-term perspective in building disaster resilience, focussing on improving institutional quality and social capital to manage the uncertainties and complexities inherent in disaster scenarios effectively.";"adaptive capacity; disaster resilience; institutional quality; collaborative governance; social capital; biological hazards; disasters; DISASTER RESILIENCE; NATURAL DISASTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION; INFANT-MORTALITY; COPING CAPACITY; VULNERABILITY; GOVERNANCE; INSTITUTIONS; MANAGEMENT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The accident destroyed one of the RBMK-1000 type reactors and released significant radioactive contamination into the environment. At first the emissions were transported north-westwards over Poland, the Baltic States, Finland, Sweden and Norway. During 27 April 1986 emissions were spreading to eastern-central Europe, southern Germany, Italy and Yugoslavia. Radioactivity mapping over Finland between 29 April and 16 May 1986 showed that the ground deposition in Finland covered southern and central parts of the country but had an irregular distribution. The highest (over 100 mu R h(-1) [1 mu Sv h(-1)]) contamination disclosed by the mapping was around the city of Uusikaupunki in western Finland and the city of Kotka in southeastern Finland. The Uusikaupunki region was an area of heavy fallout associated with the air mass that was located in the Chernobyl area at the time of the accident. The fallout pattern of reftractory nuclides, e.g. plutonium isotopes, had their spatial maximum in this region. Medical consequences in Finland were luckily mild, the most important symptoms being psychological ones. No increase in thyroid cancer or birth defect occurrence has been observed. The Chernobyl accident boosted the radioecological research which had already been calming down after the last atmospheric nuclear test in China in October 1980. Important new results concerning e.g. hot particles have been achieved. The most important effects of the accident in Finland were, however, the increase of public awareness of environmental issues in general and especially of nuclear energy. In Finland, the nuclear energy programme was halted until 2002 when the Parliament of Finland granted a licence to build the fifth nuclear reactor in Finland.";"HOT PARTICLES; SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; SOUTHERN FINLAND; FALLOUT; AIR; PLUTONIUM; INVENTORY; AEROSOLS; ELEMENTS; SWEDEN";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Moreover, effect of high voltage bias and ambient parameters on leakage current in PV modules on individual modules is studied. Any degradation occurring during initial 18 months could not be assessed due to data acquisition and hurricane problems.

Immunohistochemical and autoradiographic data demonstrate a constellation of serotonergic defects in the caudal raphe nuclei in infants who died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The purpose of this review is to synthesize what is known about adaptive responses of the infant to severely hypoxic conditions, which unleash a flood of neuromodulators that inhibit cardiorespiratory function, thermogenesis, and arousal and the emerging role of serotonin, which combats this cardiorespiratory inhibition to foster autoresuscitation, eupnea, and arousal to ensure survival following an hypoxic episode. The laryngeal and carotid body chemoreflexes are potent in newborns and infants, and both reflexes can induce apnea and bradycardia, which may be adaptive initially, but must be terminated if an infant is to survive. Serotonin has a unique ability to touch on each of the processes that may be required to recover from hypoxic reflex apnea: gasping, the restoration of heart rate and blood pressure, termination of apneas and, eventually, stimulation of eupnea and arousal. Recurrent apneic events, bradycardia, ineffective gasping and a failure to terminate apneas and restore eupnea are observed in animals harboring defects in the caudal serotonergic system models - all of these phenotypes are reminiscent of and compatible with the cardiorespiratory recordings made in infants who subsequently died of SIDS. The caudal serotonergic system provides an organized, multi-pronged defense against reflex cardiorespiratory inhibition and the hypoxia that accompanies prolonged apnea, bradycardia and hypotension, and any deficiency of caudal serotonergic function will increase the propensity for sudden unexplained infant death.";"Sudden infant death syndrome; Arousal; 5-HT; Caudal raphe; Autoresuscitation; Apnea; Adenosine; Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA); Autonomic neuroscience; ADENOSINE A(2A) RECEPTORS; HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; LARYNGEAL NERVE-STIMULATION; NUCLEUS RAPHE OBSCURUS; CAROTID-BODY; ARTERIAL CHEMORECEPTORS; MEDIATED MODULATION; INTERMITTENT HYPOXIA; MEDULLA-OBLONGATA; AROUSAL RESPONSES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

A hard-template 2-step pyrolysis method is proposed for the fabrication of highly dispersed Ni and Cu atomic active sites on a 3D macroporous carbon matrix. The pyrrolic N-type Ni-N-x sites serve as dominant active sites toward selective CO2 electroreduction to CO. The incorporation of Cu alters the distribution of N species and simultaneously optimizes the electronic state and geometric structure of the Ni-N-x moiety, thereby improving its adsorption and activation capacity for CO2. Moreover, the isolated Cu atomic sites enhance the resistance of corresponding gas-diffusion electrodes against electrolyte flooding. The optimal catalyst 3D NiCu-69 achieves nearly exclusive production of CO with a Faraday efficiency (FECO) of 98% at a current density of -700 mA cm(-2) in a CO2-gas-fed flow-through electrolyzer and delivers a CO production rate of 1363 mol(m(2)s)(-1), which is exceeding most reported electrocatalysts. The FECO remained as high as 94% after electrolyzing at a current density of -100 mA cm(-2) for 22 h. 3D NiCu-69 exhibits a favorable performance in both acidic and neutral conditions, with a high FECO of approximate to 90.2% within the current density range of -100 to -500 mA cm(-2).";"2-step pyrolysis; 3D macroporous carbon; CO2 electroreduction; electrolyzer; single-atom catalyst; CONVERSION; REDUCTION";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Objective To determine whether primary midwife care (caseload midwifery) decreases the caesarean section rate compared with standard maternity care. Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting Tertiary-care womens hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Population A total of 2314 low-risk pregnant women. Methods Women randomised to caseload received antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care from a primary midwife with some care by back-up midwives. Women randomised to standard care received either midwifery or obstetric-trainee care with varying levels of continuity, or community-based general practitioner care. Main outcome measures Primary outcome: caesarean birth. Secondary outcomes included instrumental vaginal births, analgesia, perineal trauma, induction of labour, infant admission to special/neonatal intensive care, gestational age, Apgar scores and birthweight. Results In total 2314 women were randomised1156 to caseload and 1158 to standard care. Women allocated to caseload were less likely to have a caesarean section (19.4% versus 24.9%; risk ratio [RR] 0.78; 95% CI 0.670.91; P = 0.001); more likely to have a spontaneous vaginal birth (63.0% versus 55.7%; RR 1.13; 95% CI 1.061.21; P < 0.001); less likely to have epidural analgesia (30.5% versus 34.6%; RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.790.996; P = 0.04) and less likely to have an episiotomy (23.1% versus 29.4%; RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.670.92; P = 0.003).

Several years of drought have aggravated this problem. The shallow groundwater in the city has received tremendous amounts of pollutants due to a lack of proper waste and wastewater disposal. Common indicators are elevated concentrations of nutrients such as nitrate and faecal bacteria. The high infant mortality can at least partially be attributed to insufficient water hygiene.

The Health Sector Assessment (HSA) concluded that climate variability and change are likely to increase morbidity and mortality risks for several climate-sensitive health outcomes, with the net impact uncertain. The objective of this study was to update the first HSA based on recent publications that address the potential impacts of climate variability and change in the United States for the five health outcome categories. The literature published since the first HSA supports the initial conclusions, with new data refining quantitative exposure-response relationships for several health end points, particularly for extreme heat events and air pollution. The United States continues to have a very high capacity to plan for and respond to climate change, although relatively little progress has been noted in the literature on implementing adaptive strategies and measures.

The objectives of this study were to report the rate of breastfeeding initiation within 1hour of birth in Jiangyou, China, to determine its impact on full breastfeeding at discharge, and to investigate factors associated with early breastfeeding initiation. Methods A prospective cohort study of infant feeding practices was undertaken during 2010 and 2011 in Jiangyou, 2years after an earthquake caused extensive damage. A total of 695 mothers were recruited from hospitals and health centers and interviewed at discharge. Results In this study, 9.1 percent of women began breastfeeding within 1hour postpartum. Mothers who initiated breastfeeding early were more likely to be fully breastfeeding at discharge (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.23-3.60). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that giving birth at a health center was associated with delayed breastfeeding initiation (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.04-0.32), whereas attending antenatal classes (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.36-4.87) and receiving encouragement from hospital staff to initiate breastfeeding (OR 5.60, 95% CI 2.31-13.55) were correlated with putting the baby to the breast soon after delivery. Conclusions Early breastfeeding initiation rate was low and the use of prelacteal foods was widespread in Jiangyou. Early breastfeeding initiation was associated with higher full breastfeeding rates at discharge. It is important to educate doctors and nurses to assist mothers with early breastfeeding initiation and to discourage the use of non-breastmilk prelacteal feeds.

In the short term, disasters are associated with physical trauma, adverse environmental exposures, and unstable housing. In the longer term, disasters may lead to relocation, changes in family functioning, and negative economic effects. These aspects of disaster exposure, in turn, lead to lack of access to health care, increased stress and negative mental health outcomes, and negative behavioral changes, including smoking and substance use, poor nutrition, physical overexertion and limited activity, and reduction in breastfeeding. All of these factors interact with social determinants of health to worsen effects on the most vulnerable women, infants, and communities. Few interventions after disasters have been tested.

In this EGM, we integrated 133 studies published in English, including qualitative, quantitative, reviews and grey literature that examined the impact of climate change on maternal health (women aged 15-45). We used Covidence to screen studies and Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (Eppi reviewer)/Eppi Mapper software to generate the EGM. Data extraction and qualitative appraisal of the studies was done using critical appraisal tools. The study protocol was registered in International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY) # INPLASY202370085. Out of 133 included studies, forty seven studies were of high quality, seventy nine moderate equality and seven low quality. This EGM found notable gaps in the literature regarding the distribution of research across regions. We found significant research in North America (51) and Asia (40 studies). However, Africa and the Caribbean had fewer studies, highlighting potential disparities in research attention and resources. Moreover, while the impact of extreme heat emerged as a prominent factor impacting maternal well-being, there is a need for further investigation into other climate-related factors such as drought. Additionally, while preterm stillbirth and maternal mortality have gained attention, there is an overlook of malnutrition and food insecurity indicators that require attention in future research. The EGM identifies existing research gaps in climate change and maternal health.

Methods: A cross-sectional household survey was conducted in August 2004. 402 women of reproductive age (15-50) were interviewed regarding their pregnancy history, access to and utilization of health care, and infant and child health care practices. Results: Women's access to education was low at 15% for any formal schooling; adult female literacy was <20%. One third of women received any antenatal care during their last pregnancy. Institutional delivery and skilled birth attendance were <1%, and there were no reported cesarean deliveries. Birth was commonly attended by a female relative, and 8% of women delivered alone. Use of unsterilized instrument to cut the umbilical cord was nearly universal (94%), while coverage for tetanus toxoid immunization was only 14%. Traditional Tibetan healers were frequently sought for problems during pregnancy (70%), the postpartum period (87%), and for childhood illnesses (74%). Western medicine (61%) was preferred over Tibetan medicine (9%) for preventive antenatal care. The average time to reach a health facility was 4.3 hours. Postpartum infectious morbidity appeared to be high, but only 3% of women with postpartum problems received western medical care. 64% of recently pregnant women reported that they were very worried about dying in childbirth. The community reported 3 maternal deaths and 103 live births in the 19 months prior to the survey. Conclusions: While China is on track to achieve national Millennium Development Goal targets for maternal and child health, women and children in Surmang suffer from substantial health inequities in access to antenatal, skilled birth and postpartum care. Institutional delivery, skilled attendance and cesarean delivery are virtually inaccessible, and consequently maternal and infant morbidity and mortality are likely high. Urgent action is needed to improve access to maternal, neonatal and child health care in these marginalized populations. The reconstruction after the recent earthquake provides a unique opportunity to link this population with the health system.";"Tibetan; Qinghai; Yushu; China; facility delivery; institutional delivery; maternal morbidity; maternal mortality; maternal health; child health; newborn health; Yushu earthquake; SYSTEM REFORM; MORTALITY; CARE; MANAGEMENT; SETTINGS; YOUNGER; BIRTH; RISK";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

There is a lack of understanding of the specific immune mechanisms involved in smoke exposure, with preventive and targeted interventions needed. After exposure to fire smoke, which includes PM2.5, toxic metals and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, epidemiology-based studies have demonstrated increases in respiratory (for example, asthma exacerbation), cardiac (for example, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias), neurological (for example, stroke) and pregnancy-related (for example, low birthweight, premature birth) outcomes. However, mechanistic studies exploring how smoke exposure disrupts cellular homeostasis are lacking. Therefore, we collected blood from smoke-exposed individuals (n = 31) and age-matched and sex-matched non-smoke-exposed controls (n = 29), and investigated these complex interactions using a single-cell exposomic approach based on both methylation and mass cytometry. Overall, our data demonstrated a strong association between smoke exposure and methylation at 133 disease-relevant gene loci, while immunophenotyping showed increased homing and activation biomarkers. We developed an application of mass cytometry to analyze single-cell/metal binding and found, for example, increased levels of mercury in dead cells and cadmium in the live and dead cell populations. Moreover, mercury levels were associated with years of smoke exposure. Several epigenetic sites across multiple chromosomes were associated with individual toxic metal isotopes in single immune cells. Our methods for detecting the effect of smoke exposure at the single-cell level and the study results may help to determine the timing of exposure and identify specific molecular targets that could be modified to prevent and manage exposure to smoke.";"T-CELLS; WILDFIRE; VISUALIZATION; INNATE; RISK";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The ease of transmission of a disease with a 50% mortality rate for those once infected raises particular challenges for breast-feeding women. This systematic review explored the attitudes and preferences of pregnant women, mothers, family members, health practitioners and policy makers concerning infant feeding during an Ebola epidemic as documented in qualitative studies. Participants reported confusion and inconsistent guidance regarding breast-feeding practice, together with difficulties in conveying recommendations to separate mothers infected with Ebola from their breast-feeding infants. Disruption impacted on access to supplementary and complementary feeds, health systems monitoring child growth and support to child health. Widespread distrust and suspicion of health professionals hindered health care provision. Wider family assumed roles in feeding and caring for young children, within the context of reduced access to nutritious foods and supplementary feeds. The work of humanitarian agencies, while valuable, lacked coordination. Planning for an Ebola outbreak requires advance preparation of health messaging for mothers and caregivers, coordinated provision of complementary feeds and support for families who assume caring responsibilities. Strategies to ensure linked up working between government and humanitarian agencies are essential. BackgroundBreast-feeding holds considerable potential to reduce infant mortality. Feeding choices, already complex, take on additional complexity against a backdrop of the risk of transmissible Ebola Virus. This review describes the factors that influence infant feeding and attitudes of pregnant women, mothers, family members and health practitioners, policy makers and providers (midwives) concerning infant feeding when there is a risk of Mother-to-Child (MTC) transmission of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). MethodologyA systematic review of qualitative studies identified through rigorous searches of thirteen online databases and additional citation searches of included studies was undertaken. Search terms included breast-feeding, breast-feeding, infant feeding; Ebola; and qualitative, interview(s) and findings. Independent extraction of data by two reviewers using predefined extraction forms. Studies were assessed using the CASP Qualitative checklist. Principal findings5219 references were screened. 38 references related specifically to Ebola, and five papers met the inclusion criteria with data gathered from two settings: Guinea and Sierra Leone. The EVD outbreak had a significant impact on beliefs, attitudes, and resources to support infant feeding practices negatively affecting the nutritional status of children. The evidence from these studies highlight the need for guidance and appropriate psychosocial support need to be available to mothers who display symptoms and become infected and to front-line staff who are giving advice. Communities need to be engaged because stigma and fear may hinder uptake of appropriate interventions. The EVD outbreak caused multi-level system disruption akin to that seen following a natural disaster, meaning that logistics and coordination are critical and need adequate resourcing. Food production and distribution, and malnutrition screening are also disrupted and thereby compounding compromised nutritional status. The limited number of relevant studies highlights the need for further primary research, particularly in translation of messages to local settings. ConclusionsAn EVD outbreak causes multi-level disruption that negatively impacts infant feeding and child care practices. Negative impacts have multiple causes and successful planning for Ebola outbreaks requires that nutrition of infants and young children is a priority. Lessons from the Ebola pandemic have wider applicability to other pandemic contexts including Covid-19.";"HEALTH; OUTBREAK; IMPACT; CARE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The broad range of the speech and language therapy profession's scope of practice incorporates prevention, advocacy and equality in service delivery. These act as a springboard for involvement in climate change and health. Aims This is an appeal to speech and language therapists (SLTs) to focus and take action on this issue and its considerable effects on communication and swallowing disorders. Methods & Procedures This article discusses the importance of taking a public health position on prevention and equality of services to manage environmental determinants of communication and swallowing disorders. It also describes the extent to which climate change affects these disorders and exacerbates the inequality of healthcare services in low- and middle-income countries. Main Contribution Five strategies are provided for action on fulfilling therapists' roles in reducing the incidence, development and exacerbation of climate-related communication and swallowing disorders, as well as the role of SLTs in acting as advocates. The case is made for expanding the scope of services to focus on prevention and service equality so as to best meet the needs of the wider community. Conclusions & Implications Despite other challenges currently facing SLTs, climate change and its increasing effects on communication disorders and dysphagia is difficult to ignore. SLTs owe it to their clients, the wider community, low- and middle-income countries, the economy, and the future to take action. What this paper adds What this paper adds to existing knowledgeWhat is already known on the subject What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that climate change is extremely likely to be due to human activities. The global effects will be higher temperatures, changes in precipitation, more droughts and heatwaves, stronger and more intense hurricanes, and a rising sea level which directly threaten the health of entire populations. Other health professions are beginning to take climate change into account in training and practice. Many disorders of communication and swallowing are caused or exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Increasing temperatures, extremes of precipitation, population displacement and air pollution contribute to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, respiratory disease, malnutrition, premature birth, air- and water-borne diseases, and mental illness. These may affect the communication and swallowing abilities across the lifespan, but particularly those of children and older adults. SLTs' roles in prevention, advocacy and education act as a starting point for involvement in climate change and health. Three practical strategies for action include educating SLTs and other health professionals on climate change and its effects on communication and swallowing, promoting awareness with clients and their families, and gathering and disseminating reliable data.";"advocacy; prevention; climate change; equality of services; scope of practice; public health; HEALTH-CARE; NATURAL DISASTERS; COMMUNICATION DISABILITY; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; RECURRENT STROKE; WORLD REPORT; RISK; PEOPLE; CANCER";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

However, the consequences of their failure can be catastrophic, as demonstrated by recent examples. Here this study revisits dam failures worldwide since 1900, analysing key factors driving the failure risk, profiling current dam safety and providing an outlook to the near future. Similar to previous analyses (1970s to 2010s), we observe a strong infant mortality, which remains especially important for the development of new embankment dams, while recent concrete dams have become more resilient. In contrast, hazard signals related to ageing remain yet less apparent, contrary to common belief. Nevertheless, given their abundance, we expect decades-old dams to be prevalent in future failure statistics-especially for embankment dams of height between 15 and 70 m built in the second half of the last century. This highlights the relevance of investments in monitoring, maintenance and uprating, which, if ignored, could become a substantial liability and a major vulnerability, especially in the context of increased flooding frequency. We uncover a trend of increased failure rates of newly constructed dams in low-income regions, which coincides with areas where a substantial hydropower potential remains untapped. This is especially intensified in monsoon-dominated climates, whereas the pattern of construction and failures is more homogeneous across other major climatic regions. Our statistical analysis suggests that 23 (95% confidence interval 14-33) large dam failures are to be expected worldwide in the near future (2023-2035), with currently similar to 4.4% of large dams having a probability of failure larger than 1/10,000. Contrarily, 85% of large dams are at least twice as safe as this threshold, commonly embraced in policy. These findings can support the targeted allocation of limited resources for the future-proofing of infrastructure, thereby contributing to water, food and energy security.";"ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; WATER; RISK; BIODIVERSITY; HYDROPOWER; RESERVOIRS; GLACIERS; FAILURE; EVENTS; ENERGY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Methods: Here, we present a sibling-matched case-control study of 227,948 newborns to identify an association between fire-sourced fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and birthweight in 54 LMICs from 2000 to 2014. We selected mothers from the geocoded Demographic and Health Survey with at least two children and valid birthweight records. Newborns affiliated with the same mother were defined as a family group. Gestational exposure to LFS was assessed in each newborn using the concentration of fire-sourced PM2.5. We determined the associations of the within-group variations in LFS exposure with birthweight differences between matched siblings using a fixed-effects regression model. Additionally, we analyzed the binary outcomes of low birthweight (LBW) or very low birthweight (VLBW). Results: According to fully adjusted models, a 1 mu g/m(3) increase in the concentration of fire-sourced PM2.5 was significantly associated with a 2.17 g (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-3.77) reduction in birthweight, a 2.80% (95% CI 0.97-4.66) increase in LBW risk, and an 11.68% (95% CI 3.59-20.40) increase in VLBW risk.

No significant difference was found in population size over the study period, though a marked decline in the population occurred following a 2-year drought. The population rebounded rapidly after the immediate postdrought period. There was nearly a complete replacement of individuals over the study period. Average group size is 11.5 animals, and adult male to female sex ratio is 0.92. Most females reproduce annually, and the average fecundity rate is 84.3%. The greatest variability in fecundity is found among old females. We suggest that ring-tailed lemur females follow an ""income breeding"" strategy, i.e., females use maximum resources during reproduction rather than relying on fat stores, as do ""capital breeders."" Infant mortality to 1 year of age in a nondrought year is 52%, higher than infant mortality in small to medium-sized anthropoids. The oldest known female was 18 years old in 2001. We suggest that 18-20 years may represent the maximum life-span for wild ring-tailed lemurs. Because males regularly emigrate from the population, we have no data regarding male life-span; however, there is some indication that males do not survive as long as females. Group fission has occurred three times: twice from one parent group living in the driest area of the reserve, with the most dispersed food resources. We suggest that the reproductive strategy that has evolved in this species, wherein females reproduce early in life and annually until old age, is a response to the unusual climate and environmental conditions under which Lemur catta has evolved.

Following the 2010 earthquake, Midwives for Haiti received requests to expand services and numerous professional midwives answered the call to volunteer. This author was one of those volunteers. The purpose of the study was: 1) to develop a description of the program's strengths and its deficits in order to determine if there was a need to improve the preparation of volunteers prior to service and 2) to make recommendations aimed at strengthening the volunteers' contributions to the education of Haiti and auxiliary midwives. MethodsThree distinct but closely related questionnaires were developed to survey Haitian students, staff midwives, and volunteers who served with Midwives for Haiti. Questions were designed to elicit information about how well the volunteers were prepared for their experience, the effectiveness of translation services, and suggestions for improving the preparation of volunteers and strengthening the education program. ResultsAnalysis of the surveys of volunteers, staff, midwives, and the Haitian students generated several common themes. The 3 groups agreed that the volunteers made an effective contribution to the program of education and that the volunteer midwives need more preparation prior to serving in Haiti. The 3 groups also agreed on the need for better translators and recommended more structure to the education program. DiscussionThe results of this study are significant to international health care organizations that use volunteer health care professionals to provide services. The results support a growing body of knowledge that international health aid organizations may use to strengthen the preparation, support, and effectiveness of volunteer health providers.

Design: A population-based cohort study. Setting: Not applicable. Patient(s): Newborn infants and fetuses spontaneously aborted after 12 weeks of gestation. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Yearly sex ratios of fetal deaths and newborn infants and monthly fetal death rates and sex ratios of newborn infants. Result(s): A statistically significant positive association was found between yearly temperature differences and sex ratios of fetal deaths; a statistically significant negative association was found between temperature differences and sex ratios of newborn infants from 1968 to 2012, and between sex ratios of births and of fetal deaths. The sex ratios of fetal deaths have been increasing steadily along with temperature differences, whereas the sex ratios of newborn infants have been decreasing since the 1970s. Two climate extremes, a very hot summer in 2010 and a very cold winter in January 2011, showed not only statistically significant declines in sex ratios of newborn infants 9 months later in June 2011 and October 2011 but also statistically significant increases of fetal death rates immediately, in September 2010 and January 2011. Conclusion(s): The recent temperature fluctuations in Japan seem to be linked to a lower male: female sex ratio of newborn infants, partly via increased male fetal deaths.

Investigations of 4 representative cases are presented here with a definition of the gross and histopathologic defects and an overview of epidemiologic data gathered from affected farms. Calves showed variable disproportionate dwarfism without arthrogryposis. Long bones were shortened and showed axial rotation. Articular surfaces were distorted with misshapen weight-bearing surfaces associated with variable thickness of articular cartilage. Physes were distorted and variable in thickness with occasional foci of complete closure. The major histologic abnormality in the physes was disorderly development of the zones of cartilage hypertrophy, with reduced number and irregular arrangement of hypertrophic chondrocytes; similar less severe changes were present in the zones of cartilage proliferation. Histochemical staining of the cartilage matrix was variable in intensity, and there was evidence of abnormal resorption of cartilage matrix at the level of the primary spongiosa. Osteoid formation and subsequent bone remodelling seemed unaffected, and diaphyseal cortical bone appeared normal at the gross and light microscopic level. No infectious agents were identified, and other known causes for chondrodysplasia in calves were excluded. The most likely cause for the syndrome was considered to be congenital manganese deficiency.

Among the impacts of climate change on pediatric patients are allergic rhinitis and asthma; heat-related illnesses; premature birth; injuries from severe storms and fires; vector-borne diseases; and mental illnesses. Children are disproportionately affected as well by climate -related displacement of populations, drought, water shortages, and famine. The human-generated burning of fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause global warming. The US healthcare industry is responsible for 8.5% of the nation's entire greenhouse gases and toxic air pollutants.

Reliable and accessible heat and weather warning systems are key in alerting individuals to undertake protective measures. There is a notable gap in understanding how women and caregivers in rural East Africa perceive and utilize weather information. We investigated community members' heat and weather warning information-seeking behaviour, identified available sources, assessed their reliability and utility, and examined their influence on behaviour. Settings Our research was conducted in rural Kilifi County in Kenya's coastal region. The area experiences temperatures exceeding 23 degrees C throughout the year, with extended periods of extreme temperatures [> 40 degrees C] and long and severe droughts. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews [IDI] with pregnant and postpartum women [n = 21] and held six focus group discussions [FGDs] involving mothers-in-law and community health volunteers [CHVs]. The data were analysed in NVivo 12 using both inductive and deductive approaches. Results We found significant gaps concerning pregnant and post-partum women, and their caregivers, having timely access to weather forecasts and heat information from health or meteorological authorities. Information on heat and weather warnings is disseminated through various channels, including television, radio, mobile phones, and word of mouth, which are facilitated by community influencers such as CHVs and local chiefs. Indigenous methods of weather forecasting, such as cloud observation, consulting local ""rainmakers"", and studying the behavioural patterns of amphibians, are employed in conjunction with warnings from the Kenyan Meteorological Department (KMD). Barriers to accessing weather information include the cost of television and smartphones and a lack of segmented information in local languages. Conclusions National and county meteorological services need to enhance public participation, communication, and the delivery of heat and weather information to guide community-level response measures and individual behaviour change. They should also collaborate with health professionals to address heat risks for vulnerable groups. Further research is needed to empower indigenous weather predictors with modern weather information and revise national policies to deliver tailored messages to vulnerable populations like pregnant and postpartum women.";"CLIMATE; HEALTH; FORECASTS; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEMS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Nomads often avoid exposure to infectious agents by moving away from epidemics such as measles. Trachoma is highly prevalent due to flies attracted by cattle. The high prevalence of tuberculosis is ascribed to the presence of cattle, crowded sleeping quarters and lack of health care; treatment compliance is generally poor. Guinea worm disease is common due to unsafe water sources. Helminth infections are relatively rare as people leave their waste behind when they move. Malaria is usually epidemic, leading to high mortality. Sexually transmitted diseases spread easily due to lack of treatment. Leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis are encountered; brucellosis occurs but most often goes undetected. Drought forces nomads to concentrate near water sources or even into relief camps, with often disastrous consequences for their health. Existing health care systems are in the hands of settled populations and rarely have access to nomads due to cultural, political and economic obstacles. A primary health care system based on nomadic community health workers is outlined and an example of a successful tuberculosis control project is described.

I combine a natural experiment-a strong earthquake in Chile-with a panel survey to capture the effect of prenatal exposure on acute stress and children's cognitive ability. I find that stress exposure in early pregnancy has no effect on children's cognition among middle-class families, but it has a strong negative influence among disadvantaged families. I then examine possible pathways accounting for the socioeconomic stratification in the effect of stress, including differential exposure across socioeconomic status, differential sensitivity, and parental responses.

In this review we summarise the current knowledge in this area, and propose a potential mechanism linking bushfire smoke exposure in utero to poor perinatal and respiratory outcomes in the offspring. Bushfire smoke exposure is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes including reduced birth weight and an increased risk of prematurity. Some publications have outlined the adverse health effects on young children, particularly in relation to emergency department presentations and hospital admissions for respiratory problems, but there are no studies in children who were exposed to bushfire smoke in utero. Prenatal stress is likely to occur as a result of catastrophic bushfire events, and stress is known to be associated with poor perinatal and respiratory outcomes. Changes to DNA methylation are potential epigenetic mechanisms linking both smoke particulate exposure and prenatal stress to poor childhood respiratory health outcomes.

The Deep South is also unique in that it is the most racially diverse part of the United States and it has the powerful social history of chattel slavery. In this paper, we examine the relationship between race and poverty at the macro (rather than individual) level. Using county-level census data we examine the effects of social segregation on well-being. We find that indeed there is an extremely strong and significant relationship between the racial composition of a county and many measures of well-being (poverty, home ownership, educational attainment, infant mortality and so on). Second, our analysis tests for the effects of racial segregation for whites and African Americans separately. The poverty rate for whites varies little based on the racial composition of the county they live in whereas for African Americans, living in integrated or predominately white counties is significantly correlated with lower levels of poverty. Furthermore, the African American- white poverty gap is significantly lower in integrated and predominately white counties and significantly higher in counties that are racially segregated. Thus, our analysis demonstrates that racial segregation has a more negative and profound effect on the lives of African Americans than it does on whites. We conclude with a discussion of the illustration Hurricane Katrina provides of this general pattern and we offer a set of suggestions for addressing this kind of structural poverty.

They show that the expected effects are theoretically ambiguous because of a tension between income and substitution effects. They then review the recent empirical literature on the subject. In richer countries, like the United States, child health and education outcomes are counter-cyclical: they improve during recessions. In poorer countries, mostly in Africa and low-income Asia, the outcomes are procyclical: infant mortality rises and school enrollment and nutrition fall during recessions. In the middle-income countries of Latin America, the picture is more nuanced: health outcomes are generally procyclical and education outcomes counter-cyclical.

The findings show that forest fires generate cascading effects on economic growth, ecological services, biodiversity, human health, and macroeconomic stability, all critical for achieving sustainable development goals. Persistent research gaps include the scarcity of region-specific long-term studies, limited integration of opportunity costs into economic assessments, insufficient attention to chronic health impacts, lack of socio-ecological evaluations, minimal empirical work on indigenous populations, and inadequate practical assessment of fire management technologies.

This study aimed to examine maternal depression and anxiety in postpartum individuals by income and race during a stressful large-scale event, and the mediating role of government assistance, housing, and employment.MethodsAn explanatory sequential mixed methods study was conducted (QUANT + QUAL). For aim 1 (quantitative), birthing individuals who delivered during peak pandemic (June 2020 - September 2021) completed questionnaires related to their perinatal experiences and mental health. Macrosystem factors (government assistance, housing, and employment changes) were assessed using the Psychosocial Recommended Measures. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7) assessed depression and anxiety, respectively. Serial linear regression models assessed the relationship between race and income with mental health and macrosystem factors. For aim 2 (qualitative), 40 individuals from the quantitative study balanced by income (low vs. high income) and race (Black vs. White) completed one-on-one semi-structured interviews which were analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsAmongst 1582 birthing individuals, Black individuals had a significantly higher EPDS score compared to White counterparts. Not receiving government assistance, unstable housing, and experiencing various employment changes were all related to worse mental health during stressful large-scale events. In semi-structured interviews, low-income individuals discussed that government assistance helped alleviate a financial and mental burden. Low- and high-income individuals reported varying job changes that impacted their mental health (low-income: job loss, high-income: increased hours).ConclusionsThis research spotlights the negative impact of large-scale events most affected both Black and low-income individuals' postpartum mental health, and the role of government assistance, stable housing, and secure employment in helping to alleviate these disparities between income levels.";"Postpartum; Depression; Natural disaster; GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; BIRTH-WEIGHT; DEPRESSION; DISPARITIES; INITIATION; PREGNANCY; QUALITY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Epigenetic modification, such as DNA methylation, is considered one possible underlying mechanism. The 1998 Quebec ice storm provides a unique opportunity to study an independent prenatal stressor on child outcomes. C-peptide is the best measure of endogenous insulin secretion and is widely used in the clinical management of patients with diabetes. The objectives of this study are to determine 1) the extent to which prenatal exposure to disaster-related stress (maternal objective hardship and maternal cognitive appraisal) influences children's C-peptide secretion, and 2) whether DNA methylation of diabetes-related genes mediates the effects of prenatal stress on C-peptide secretion. Children's (n = 30) C-peptide secretion in response to an oral glucose tolerance test were assessed in blood at 13 1/2 years. DNA methylation levels of selected type 1 and 2 diabetes-related genes were chosen based upon the genes associated with prenatal maternal objective hardship and/or cognitive appraisal levels. Bootstrapping analyses were performed to determine the mediation effect of DNA methylation. We found that children whose mothers experienced higher objective hardship exhibited higher C-peptide secretion. Cognitive appraisal was not directly associated with C-peptide secretion. DNA methylation of diabetes-related genes had a positive mediation effect of objective hardship on C-peptide secretion: higher objective hardship predicted higher C-peptide secretion through DNA methylation. Negative mediation effects of cognitive appraisal were observed: negative cognitive appraisal predicted higher C-peptide secretion through DNA methylation. However, only one gene, LTA, remained a significant mediator of cognitive appraisal on C-peptide secretion after the conservative Bonferroni multiple corrections.

We used X-radiography to determine reproductive status and estimated fecundity for 73 female T. gigas collected from several regions within the range of this species in the Sacramento Valley of California, USA, and synthesize these data with data from litters born in captivity to improve our understanding of reproduction in this species. Average total litter size determined from X-rays (15.9) and captive-born litters (15.5) are within the ranges reported from other gartersnakes, but captive-born litters had high rates of stillbirth. Only 154 of 202 neonates from captive snakes were born alive, and seven of 13 litters contained at least one stillborn neonate. We found that fecundity was positively related to maternal snout-vent length, and some evidence that larger litters contained smaller neonates.

Recent work with the piglet (an animal model for studying human infant nutrition) shows that reducing protein intake can improve gut function during weaning but compromises the provision of essential amino acids (EAA) for muscle growth. The present study was conducted with weaned pigs to test the hypothesis that supplementing deficient EAA (Lys, Met, Thr, Trp, Leu, Ile and Val) to a low-protein diet may maintain the activation of translation initiation factors and adequate protein synthesis in tissues. Pigs were weaned at 21 days of age and fed diets containing 20.7, 16.7 or 12.7% crude protein (CP), with the low-CP diets supplemented with EAA to achieve the levels in the high-CP diet. On Day 14 of the trial, tissue protein synthesis was determined using the phenylalanine flooding dose method. Reducing dietary CP levels decreased protein synthesis in pancreas, liver, kidney and longissimus muscle. A low-CP diet reduced the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1) in skeletal muscle and liver while increasing the formation of an inactive eIF4E.4E-BP1 complex in muscle. Dietary protein deficiency also decreased the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the formation of an active eIF4E.eIF4G complex in liver. These results demonstrate for the first time that chronic feeding of a low-CP diet suppresses protein synthesis in animals partly by inhibiting mTOR signaling. Additionally, our findings indicate that supplementing deficient EAA to low-protein diets is not highly effective in restoring protein synthesis or whole-body growth in piglets. We suggest that conditionally essential amino acids (e.g., glutamine and arginine) may be required to maintain the activation of translation initiation factors and optimal protein synthesis in neonates.

These abnormal variations did not occur among first live births for mother's 20-29 and 40 or over, but there was an increase in March 2022 among subsequent live births for mother's 20-29, and decreases in March or April 2022 among all first live birth groups except women 20-29.

However, leucaena foliage also contains mimosine, a toxic non-protein amino acid that can cause alopecia, goiter and other thyroid problems, infertility and fetal death. Considering its toxicity and abundance in leucaena, it is important to quantify the mimosine concentrations in leucaena under different environmental conditions. Mimosine was extracted from various types of leucaena tissue exposed to a range of environmental conditions and then quantified by HPLC. The mimosine concentrations in leucaena treated with NaCl increased after 6 days of treatment and remained relatively high when treatment continued for 18 days. Interestingly, leucaena exposed to complete darkness for up to 5 days had a higher mimosine concentration than control plants exposed to normal light/dark photoperiods. On the other hand, drying leucaena leaflets or macerating them in an alkaline buffer significantly lowered their mimosine concentration. Mature leaflets that had fallen off the plant and dried out also contained significantly less mimosine than fresh leaflets.

We then estimate a set of multivariate regression models to understand how weather conditions impact child stunting, an indicator of sustained early life undernutrition. We find that greater rainfall during the rainy seasons in early life is associated with greater height for age. In addition, higher temperatures in utero, particularly during the first and third trimesters, and more rainfall during the third trimester, are positively associated with severe stunting, though stunting decreases with temperature in early life. We find potential evidence for a number of pathways underlying the weather-child nutrition relationship including agricultural livelihoods, heat stress, infectious disease transmission, and women's time use during pregnancy.

Even though prosimians are known to be long-lived in captivity, relatively little is known about their reproductive senescence, and even less is known about how prosimians age in their natural habitats. Twenty years of observational data in Madagascar for four Propithecus edwordsi sifaka groups were used to analyze reproductive and behavioral trends of aging in the wild. Techniques using tooth wear were developed to establish ages of wild sifakas and to estimate the onset of their 'dental senescence', a proxy for the onset of decline in the ability to obtain nutrition. Estimated maximum longevity was 32 years for female sifakas. Based on the loss of dental functional morphology, and changes in tooth wear patterns and in chewing efficiency, dental senescence was estimated to set in at approximately 18 years of age. Of the adult females in the study groups, the yearly average of the number of dentally senescent females was 24%. There was no indication of a decline in fertility in the dentally senescent females (aged > 18 years) compared to younger adult females (aged 4-18 years). The field data showed, however, that in years when rain was decreased during months of prime lactation, infants of dentally senescent mothers died before weaning. This may be because the nursing mother's worn teeth could not shear leaves and extract moisture, nor nutrition, both essential for successful lactation. Old females showed no clear signs of social disengagement, further suggesting that drought-induced stress plays a direct role in increased infant mortality. These data support earlier findings that prosimian females continue to cycle and give birth until death. The effect of environmental variation on infant survival, however, indicates an incipient age-linked decline in reproductive fitness. Therefore, whereas lemurs represent the condition of no menopause, changes in infant survival may uncover selective factors that have in part led to the evolution of menopause in other primates.

The main influences on maternal health encompass social, economic, political, environmental and cultural determinants of health. To effectively address maternal mortality in the post-2015 agenda, interventions need to consider the determinants of health so that their delivery is not limited to the health sector. The objective of this exploratory qualitative study was to identify key community groups' perspectives on the perceived determinants of maternal health in rural areas of southern Mozambique. Methods: Eleven focus group discussions were conducted with women of reproductive age, pregnant women, matrons, male partners, community leaders and health workers. Participants were recruited using sampling techniques of convenience and snow balling. Focus groups had an average of nine participants each. The heads of 12 administrative posts were also interviewed to understand the local context. Data were coded and analysed thematically using NVivo software. Results: A broad range of political, economic, socio-cultural and environmental determinants of maternal health were identified by community representatives. It was perceived that the civil war has resulted in local unemployment and poverty that had a number of downstream effects including lack of funds for accessing medical care and transport, and influence on socio-cultural determinants, particularly gender relations that disadvantaged women. Socio-cultural determinants included intimate partner violence toward women, and strained relationships with in-laws and co-spouses. Social relationships were complex as there were both negative and positive impacts on maternal health. Environmental determinants included natural disasters and poor access to roads and transport exacerbated by the wet season and subsequent flooding. Conclusions: In rural southern Mozambique, community perceptions of the determinants of maternal health included political, economic, socio-cultural and environmental factors. These determinants were closely linked with one another and highlight the importance of including the local history, context, culture and geography in the design of maternal health programs.";"Maternal health; Pregnancy; Determinants of health; Disparities; Poverty; Equity; PREGNANT-WOMEN; EXPOSURE; CARE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The latter explanation has been supported by research reporting that the sex ratio in California fell 3 months, but not 8, 9 or 10 months, after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. California's distance from the attacks raises the questions of whether the results arose from chance and would be found elsewhere. We contribute to the literature by testing the association between the secondary sex ratio and the events of September 11 in New York City. METHODS: We replicate the California tests by applying interrupted time-series methods, which control for secular trends, seasonality and other forms of autocorrelation, to 91 cohorts born in New York City during 28-day periods from January 1996 to June 2002.

With leptospirosis being an emerging infectious disease and as the world's environment changes with more floods and environmental disasters, the burden of leptospirosis is expected to increase. The objectives of the systematic review were to explore how leptospirosis affects pregnancy, its burden in this population, its effects on maternal and fetal outcomes and the evidence base surrounding treatment options Methods We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished literature using automated and manual methods to screen nine electronic databases since inception, with no language restriction. Two reviewers independently screened articles, completed the data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. Due to significant heterogeneity and paucity of data, we were unable to carry out a meta-analysis, but we conducted a pooled analysis of individual patient data from the case reports and case series to examine the patient and disease characteristics, diagnostic methods, differential diagnoses, antibiotic treatments, and outcomes of leptospirosis in pregnancy. The protocol for this review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO: CRD42020151501. Results We identified 419 records, of which we included eight observational studies, 21 case reports, three case series and identified four relevant ongoing studies. Overall the studies were with moderate bias and of 'fair' quality. We estimated the incidence of leptospirosis in pregnancy to be 1.3 per 10,000 in women presenting with fever or with jaundice, but this is likely to be higher in endemic areas. Adverse fetal outcomes were found to be more common in pregnant patients who presented in the second trimester compared with patients who presented in the third trimester. There is overlap between how leptospirosis presents in pregnancy and in the general population. There is also overlap between the signs, symptoms and biochemical disturbances associated with leptospirosis in pregnancy and the presentation of pregnancy associated conditions, such as Pre-Eclampsia (PET), Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) and HELLP Syndrome (Haemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platelets). In 94% of identified cases with available data, there was an indicator in the patient history regarding exposure that could have helped include leptospirosis in the clinician's differential diagnosis. We also identified a range of suitable antibiotic therapies for treating leptospirosis in pregnancy, most commonly used were penicillins Conclusion This is the first systematic review of leptospirosis in pregnancy and it clearly shows the need to improve early diagnosis and treatment by asking early, treating early, and reporting well.

Any increase in dead space volume has a proportional effect on the required tidal volume and thus on the risk of ventilation-induced lung injury. Inserts that increase dead space are therefore not used in small preterm infants. This includes end-tidal CO2 measurement. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the end-tidal CO2 measurement adapter on ventilation. METHODS: In an experimental setup, an end-tidal CO2 measurement adapter, three different pneumotachographs (PNT-A, PNT-B, PNT-Neo), and a closed suction adapter were combined in varying set-ups. The time required for CO2 elimination by a CO 2-flooded preterm infant test lung was measured. RESULTS: PNT-A prolonged CO2 elimination time by 0.9 s (+3.3%), Neo-PNT by 3.2 s (+11.6%) and PNT-B by 9.0 s (+32.7%). The end-tidal CO2 measurement adapter prolonged the elimination time by an additional second without the pneumotachograph (+3.6%) and in combination with PNT-A (+3.1%) and PNT-Neo (+3.1%). In conjunction with PNT-B, the end-tidal CO2 measurement adapter reduced the elimination time by 0.3 seconds (1%). The use of a closed suction adaptor increased the CO2 elimination time by a further second with PNT-Neo (+3.1%) and by an additional two seconds with no flow sensor (+6.9%), with PNT-A (+6.4%) and with PNT-B (+5.5%). CONCLUSION: The flow sensor had the greatest influence on ventilatory effort, while end-tidal CO2 measurement had only a moderate effect. The increased ventilatory effort levied by the CO2 measurement was dependent on the flow sensor selected. The use of closed suctioning more negatively impacted ventilatory effort than did end-tidal CO2 measurement.";"Neonatal intensive care units; tidal volume; extremely premature infant; ventilator-induced lung injury; mechanical ventilators; VOLUME-TARGETED VENTILATION; CARE PRACTICES; MORTALITY; MORBIDITY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) has caused a global pandemic and created significant stress for many people. Social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19 has also reduced social interactions, which has increased social isolation and loneliness. Loneliness is thought to increase perceived stress, cause psychological distress, and increase the risk of mental illness, such as depression. This study examined the association between serious psychological distress (SPD) and loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant Japanese women. Patients and Methods: An internet survey of 1022 pregnant women in Japan was conducted between June 1 and July 21, 2021. The 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, 3-item Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale were used as measurement tools. The prevalence of SPD was defined as a K6 score of >= 13. Results: The prevalence of SPD was 16.5%. Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk factors for SPD were younger age (odds ratio [OR] 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.10; p = 0.020), history of abortion or miscarriages (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.36; p = 0.034), unemployment (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.45; p = 0.008), fear of COVID-19 (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.17; p < 0.001), and loneliness (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.38 to 1.70; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Pregnant women in Japan showed a high prevalence of SPD. Younger age, unemployment, history of abortion or miscarriages, fear of COVID-19, and loneliness were independently associated with SPD.

Against this backdrop, Japan is potentially in a position to become a leading advocate for and supporter of global health. Nevertheless, Japan's engagement with global health has not been outstanding relative to its substantial potential, in part because of government fragmentation, a weak civil society, and lack of transparency and assessment. Japan's development assistance for health, from both governmental and non-governmental sectors, has remained low and Japanese global health leadership has been weak. New challenges arising from changes in governance and global and domestic health needs, including the recent Great East Japan Earthquake, now provide Japan with an opportunity to review past approaches to health policy and develop a new strategy for addressing global and national health. The fragmented functioning of the government with regards to global health policy needs to be reconfigured and should be accompanied by further financial commitment to global health priorities, innovative non-governmental sector initiatives, increased research capacity, and investments in good leadership development as witnessed at the G8 Hokkaido Toyako Summit. Should this strategy development and commitment be achieved, Japan has the potential to make substantial contributions to the health of the world as many countries move toward universal coverage and as Japan itself faces the challenge of maintaining its own health system.";"DISEASES; G8";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The causative agent of RVF, the RVF virus (RVFV), has the capacity to cause large and severe outbreaks in animal and human populations and to cross significant natural geographic barriers. Rift Valley fever is usually inapparent in non-pregnant adult animals, but pregnant animals and newborns can be severely affected; outbreaks are characterised by a sudden onset of abortions and high neonatal mortality. The majority of human infections are subclinical or associated with moderate to severe, non-fatal, febrile illness, but some patients may develop a haemorrhagic syndrome and/or ocular and neurological lesions. In both animals and humans, the primary site of RVFV replication and tissue pathology is the liver. Outbreaks of RVF are associated with persistent high rainfalls leading to massive flooding and the emergence of large numbers of competent mosquito vectors that transmit the virus to a wide range of susceptible vertebrate species. Outbreaks of RVF have devastating economic effects on countries for which animal trade constitutes the main source of national revenue. The propensity of the virus to spread into new territories and re-emerge in traditionally endemic regions, where it causes large outbreaks in human and animal populations, presents a formidable challenge for public and veterinary health authorities. The presence of competent mosquito vectors in RVF-free countries, the wide range of mammals susceptible to the virus, altering land use, the global changes in climate, and increased animal trade and travel are some of the factors which might contribute to international spread of RVF.";"Control; Ecology; Mosquito; Pathogenesis; Prevention; Rift Valley fever; Transmission; Zoonosis; VIRUS-INFECTION; SOUTH-AFRICA; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; GENETIC DIVERSITY; EASTERN AFRICA; NSM GENES; OUTBREAK; TRANSMISSION; PATHOGENESIS; PROTECTION";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Frequent drought often results in herd reduction and loss of valuable genetic progress. Bull selection is critical due to their influence on herd development. A survey was conducted to identify traits important to bull selection in New Mexico. Surveys were collected digitally (n = 83) and via the mail (n = 74). Responses were largely by cow/calf producers averaging 57 +/- 1 years old with 24 +/- 1 years' experience. Survey respondents represented 4,384,296 acres of private owned, private leased, and leased public rangeland and irrigated pasture meadow in New Mexico and surrounding states. Average cow/calf operation size was 294 +/- 39 head and average bull herd size was 21 +/- 3 head. Average price paid for a bull in the past 2 years was $3,981 +/- 213. Physical characteristics, individual bull performance information, and genetic information are all important traits to New Mexico bull buyers; however, most producers (56%) indicated that structural soundness was the most important factor influencing their selection decisions. Amongst expected progeny differences (EPDs), New Mexico producers consider the calving ease direct (CED) and birth weight (BW) EPDS to be most important (40% and 35%, respectively). Producers also indicated that multitrait selection indexes used by the American Angus Association were important to their selection decisions, with the beef value ($B) and weaned calf value ($W) indexes being cited most often (35% and 31%, respectively). Elements important to bull purchase include the bull's sale preview (87%), body condition score (86%), feed efficiency/average daily gain information (85%), and actual scrotal circumference (82%). Following purchase of a new bull, most (60%) keep the bull separate from the cow herd until the following breeding season, while the remaining 40% of producers turn newly purchased bulls out within 30 days of purchase. Sixty eight percent of producers evaluate semen quality annually or prior to the start of the breeding season. Interestingly, 39% of producers indicated they used reproductive technologies like artificial insemination and synchronization of estrus while most (80%) test for trichomoniasis.

Herd-wide survival estimates based on winter counts, reported harvests, and herd classifications, suggested that winter survival of elk calves was related inversely to estimated size of the elk population during winter (P = 0.0002), but we found no correlation with an index of winter severity (P = 0.51). Summer survival of elk calves also was correlated inversely with the estimated size of the elk population the previous winter (P = 0.03), Summer survival of radiocollared calves averaged 0.65 (n = 127 marked calves) from 1987 to 1990, the losses mostly due to predation (22%).

ULMER'S (1935/1942) studies of rural exodus, H. WOPFNER and H. KINZL (University of Innsbruck) started examining population problems in the Alpine mountainous areas using parish registers as a source for profound studies of some demographic-biological problems. Supervised by H. KINZL himself and his successors at the Geographical Institute, about 50 undergraduates wrote papers on this subject, having collected more than 1.3 million records of marriages, births and deaths in 180 communes in western Austria. H. KINZL (1898-1979) had intended to publish a summary of this research work, but did not realize his plan. Consequently only a small portion of his extensive life's work can be found in various publications, mainly in the ''Geographische Jahresberichte aus Osterreich'' and the ''Bergbauernbuch'' (H. WOPFNER 1951/ 1960). In 1973 H. BOBEK and in 1975 E. LICHTENBERGER praised the Innsbruck school of population geography but did not provide a synthesis. In the 1992-1994 period the present author published a few studies in the ''Tiroler Chronist'' that were later used by E. STEINICKE (1996) in his paper on teaching and research into population geography in Innsbruck. Whereas the early papers by undergraduates show a rather unreflected approach to the sources, later papers increasingly take a more critical view as to the value of the sources. Nevertheless, on the whole the papers convey a correct picture of the rural society from the 17th up to the 19th century. No first marriage in church was possible without the consent of the independent communes, and permission was only granted if sufficient means for keeping a family could be presumed. Therefore, marriage age was high (33 years for men, 30 for women - sometimes even 40 and 35) because normally couples had to wait until after the death of their parents before being able to marry. The average fertile period was 14 years with 5,5 births, the mortality rate of children up to the age of 5 was 24% and maternal mortality 1.5%. In spite of a surplus in the number of births during the past 300 years the population figure remained stable. A study of the balance of births and deaths suggests that one fourth of all children born emigrated later on, thus preventing overcrowding. There is no demographic difference between the western area with a division of properties (based on Roman law) and the eastern area with ''indivisible'' farms (based on German law). In the west only 5% of the children were illegitimate as illegitimacy was disapproved of not only by the community and the church but by the families living on small farms as well. In the east, the illegitimacy rate is at least 10%, regionally even 50%, as divorces were prohibited, a sort of insurance for possible infertility of the brides and the need for labour on large farms. Relief and traffic conditions limited the range of marriages. In the main valleys, marriages between persons related by blood at 2nd and 3rd degree amount to less than 1%, whereas in isolated valleys high up the proportion is almost 30%. In the 19th century, the avarage interval between births dropped from 26 to 17 months and infant mortality rose to 30% or more, probably caused by a worsening of the agricultural conditions, more work for women and the giving up of breastfeeding. In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries the number of deaths caused by diseases seems to be ten times greater than that caused by natural hazards (inundations, avalanches, landslides, debris-flows etc).";"";"";"";"";"";"German";"JOUR";""

Reduction in MMR by three quarters was not achieved but a decline from very high mortality to high mortality index was observed. Increase usage of contraceptives (with contraceptive prevalence rate of 11.8 in 1990 to 37 in 2013) also shed light on women awareness about their health and social issues.

This study involves 111 migrant households from central Chad that, as a result of war and drought, have lost everything and now have to live in squatter areas of N'Djamena and Mongo, facing uncertainty and threats while negotiating their livelihoods. Qualitative and quantitative methods have been combined in this study to reveal the intriguing story of their daily lives in the face of complex and endemic crises. Anthropometric and health data were generated to determine the nutritional status of mothers and their children under five. Life histories, in-depth interviews and participatory observation allowed the researchers to capture the negotiation strategies they use to access food and shelter, their experiences of food insecurity and sanitary vulnerability, and the consequences these have on daily life. Results indicate that 62% of households were female headed, there were high rates of acute (40-50%) and chronic (35-40%) malnutrition and 46% of the mothers were underweight and anaemic. Infant mortality rates were also high at 30%-42% and 97% of the children had had incomplete or no vaccinations. No households had access to clean water, sanitation or public-health services. Endemic corruption and abuse by the authorities were identified as major sources of day-to-day insecurity. These migrants were not expecting any improvement in their livelihoods in the foreseeable future and saw these miserable conditions as normal.";"Urban-migration; silent victims; humanitarian crisis; Livelihood; Chad";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Ninety-eight percent of hospitals reported capacity to perform resuscitation. General and obstetrical surgical interventions were relatively more available, for example 93 % provided hernia repairs and 98 % provided cesarean sections. More specialized interventions were at a deficit: cataract surgery (27 %), cleft repairs (31 %), clubfoot (42 %), and open treatment of fractures (51 %). Deficiencies in infrastructure and material resources were widespread and should be urgently addressed. Physician providers were mal-distributed relative to non-physician providers. Formal task-sharing to midlevel and general physician providers should be considered.

Measures to reduce fires may be a significant yet under-recognized option for efficiently improving air quality and preventing related premature deaths. Here we isolate fire-specific fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from monitoring concentrations using an observation-driven approach in the region. Fire-specific PM2.5 concentrations average 2-15 mu g m-3 during the fire season, with higher values in Southeast Asia (SEA), Northeast Asia (NEA), and northern India. The total PM2.5 in the Asia Pacific region exhibits a rapid declining trend from 2014 to 2021, while fire-specific PM2.5 decreases in early years but begins to reverse in SEA and NEA. The proportions of fire-specific PM2.5 increase in NEA from 0.2 to 0.3 during the fire season and increase in SEA from 0.2 in 2018 to 0.4 in 2021. Fire-specific PM2.5 exposure caused 58 000 (95 % confidence interval (CI) of 32 600-82 600), 90 000 (95 % CI of 63 700-106 000), 157 000 (95 % CI of 110 000-186 000), and 29 300 (95 % CI of 18 000-39 700) premature deaths annually in SEA, East Asia (EA), Central Asia (CA), and NEA, respectively, accounting for 40.9 % (95 % CI of 22.8 %-57.7 %), 14.9 % (95 % CI of 10.5 %-17.6 %), 19.4 % (95 % CI of 13.5 %-24.5 %), and 24.1 % (95 % CI of 14.8 %-32.5 %) of the numbers caused by the total PM2.5.

Problems that have plagued the process of referral include poor service quality, low availability of trained personnel, inadequate supplies of drugs and medical diagnostic equipment and inadequate communication infrastructure. In this paper, the authors analyse the role of transport costs in the utilization of referral and how community health insurance schemes can help reduce the economic burden of transport costs, thereby improving referral utilization and health outcomes. Following the introduction, the authors provide a conceptual framework of the individual; household- and community-level factors that affect referral in the rural African context, with particular emphasis on the role of the time and monetary costs of transport and the potential role of community risk-sharing schemes. The paper then presents a detailed case study from Kenya where a community has been experimenting with a health insurance scheme which provides emergency transport for emergency referral. Data from the past eight years of experience in northern Kenya suggests that support for the insurance scheme has depended on the reliability of the health system, as well as the seasons and Various external problems, such as political interference, drought and insecurity. Conclusions drawn support the idea of community financing schemes for transport, not merely as a lifesaving strategy in remote and resource-poor health infrastructures, but also as a means to help build trust in the health system itself and thus improve sustainability through local institutional support.

OBJECTIVES: In this commentary I highlight current scientific evidence indicating that the fetus and young child are at heightened risk of developmental impairment, asthma, and cancer from fossil fuel pollutants and from the predicted effects of climate disruption such as heat waves, flooding, infectious disease, malnutrition, and trauma. Increased risk during early development derives from the inherently greater biologic vulnerability of the developing fetus and child and from their long future lifetime, during which early insults can potentially manifest as adult as well as childhood disease. I cite recent reports concluding that reducing dependence on fossil fuel and promoting clean and sustainable energy is economically feasible. DISCUSSION: Although much has been written separately about the toxicity of fossil fuel burning emissions and the effects of climate change on health, these two faces of the problem have not been viewed together with a focus on the developing fetus and child. Adolescence and old age are also periods of vulnerability, but the potential for both immediate and long-term adverse effects is greatest when exposure occurs prenatally or in the early years. CONCLUSIONS: Consideration of the full spectrum of health risks to children from fossil fuel combustion underscores the urgent need for environmental and energy policies to reduce fossil fuel dependence and maximize the health benefits to this susceptible population. We do not have to leave our children a double legacy of ill health and ecologic disaster.";"asthma; cancer; climate change; energy; fetal and child development; fossil fuel; susceptibility; POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; PAH-DNA ADDUCTS; AIR-POLLUTION; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; CHROMOSOMAL-ABERRATIONS; UNITED-STATES; ENVIRONMENTAL-HEALTH; INFANT-MORTALITY; LEAD-EXPOSURE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Pregnant and post-partum women represent a substantial and vulnerable subset of the population who may be at particular risk during an attack or accidental exposure. We review the effects of halogen exposure on the parturient with a focus on bromine toxicity. Bromine is the most extensively studied agent in the context of pregnancy and to-date murine models form the basis for the majority of current knowledge. Pregnancy potentiates the acute lung injury after halogen exposure. In addition, halogen exposure precipitates a preeclamptic-like syndrome in mice. This phenotype is characterized by systemic and pulmonary hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, decreased cardiac output, placental injury and fetal growth restriction. This constellation contributes to increased maternal and fetal mortality observed after bromine exposure. Angiogenic imbalance is noted with overexpression of the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) form of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 reminiscent of human preeclampsia. Additional research is needed to further explore the effect of halogen gas exposure in pregnancy and to develop therapeutic interventions to mitigate risk to this unique population.";"Halogen; bromine; chlorine; pregnancy; cardiopulmonary injury; INDUCED LUNG INJURY; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; CIGARETTE TOBACCO; CHLORINE; BROMINE; HEME; DISINFECTION; OUTCOMES; RISK; ASSOCIATION";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

To improve maternal health coverage, an Android-based, integrated mobile health (mHealth) app called YendaNafe was introduced to community health workers (CHWs) in the Neno district, rural Malawi. This study evaluates the impact of this app on the uptake of antenatal care (ANC), facility-based births, and postnatal care (PNC), compared to a reference period where CHWs provided the same services without mHealth, using the interrupted time series analysis. Patients and Methods: Using aggregated monthly data and segmented quasi-Poisson regression models, we compared the effects of mHealth on selected maternal health outcomes. The models were adjusted for the COVID-19 pandemic, the occurrence of cyclones, and a cholera epidemic. We analyzed data from six eligible health facilities and their respective catchment areas in which CHWs were using YendaNafe, and compared 12 months before and 12 months after its introduction. Results: The use of YendaNafe was associated with a 22% immediate increase in facility-based births (aIRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12-1.33, p<0.001) but not an immediate increase in new ANC visits (aIRR 1.02,95% CI 0.90-1.14, p=0.77), ANC in the first trimester (aIRR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95-1.45 p=0.13), or PNC visits (aIRR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79-1.36, p=0.81).

While men bear the sex-determining chromosome, the role of the female partner as it pertains to fertilization or miscarriage may also alter the gender ratio. We attempted to determine a man's secondary sex ratio (F1 generation) by directly examining the sex chromosomes of his sperm. We examined our male infertility clinic database for all men who had undergone a semen fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Patient demographic and semen parameters were recorded. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare gender ratios (Y chromosomes/total chromosomes). Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict the odds of possessing a Y-bearing sperm after accounting for demographic and semen parameters. A total of 185 men underwent sperm FISH. For the entire cohort, the proportion of Y chromosome-bearing sperm was 51.5%. Men with less than five million motile sperm had a significantly lower proportion of Y chromosome-bearing sperm (50.8%) compared to men with higher sperm counts (51.6%; P=0.02). After multivariable adjustment, a higher sperm concentration, total motile sperm count and semen volume significantly increased the odds of having a Y chromosome-bearing sperm (P<0.01). As a man's sperm production declines, so does the proportion of Y chromosome-bearing sperm. Thus, a man's reproductive potential may predict his ability to sire male offspring.

Children and young teenagers constitute some 50% of war-stricken populations. This paper explores this increasingly important role of military medicine from the point of view of a practicing pediatrician and career doctor-soldier. Many international operational deployments undertaken in the last 5 years have required the insertion of pediatric clinical and preventive health resources. Deployments to Rwanda, the countries of the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Bougainville (in Papua New Guinea), Irian Jaya (in Indonesia), and the Aitape tsunami disaster response (the Sepik region of Papua New Guinea) have all necessitated major pediatric interventions. In some operational deployments, in excess of one-third of patient and clinical contacts have involved the care of children, including clinical treatments ranging from life-saving resuscitation to the care of children with both tropical and subtropical illnesses. They have also involved mass immunization campaigns (e.g., in Rwanda) to prevent measles and meningococcal septicemia. In developing countries, at any time approximately 1 in 4 teenage and adult women is pregnant; and of these, 1 in 15 is suffering a miscarriage during any 2-week period. The implications of this audit are that service members must be multiskilled not only in the traditional aspects of military medicine and nursing but also in (a) the developmental aspects of childhood; (b) the prevention of infectious childhood diseases by immunization and other means; (c) the recognition and management of diseases of childhood; and (d) the management of the normal neonate and infant, especially those orphaned in refugee, disaster, and other emergency situations. Doctor-soldiers hold special credentials to be advocates for the protection of children caught up in armed conflict and its aftermath. In this context, advocacy to ban antipersonnel land mines is topical, because unfortunately the more than 2,000 deaths and injuries each month involve children and their families, often injured long after the cessation of hostilities.

There has been controversy about the effectiveness and safety of this approach, but no pharmacovigilance studies or evaluations have been published to date. Method: A questionnaire about the cultivation of A. annua, treatment of patients, and side-effects observed, was sent to partners of the NGO Anamed in Kenya and Uganda. Some of the respondents were then selected purposively for more in-depth semi-structured interviews. Results: Eighteen partners in Kenya and 21 in Uganda responded. 49% reported difficulties in growing the plant, mainly due to drought. Overall about 3,000 cases of presumed malaria had been treated with A. annua teas in the previous year, of which about 250 were in children and 54 were in women in the first trimester of pregnancy. The commonest problem observed in children was poor compliance due to the bitter taste, which was improved by the addition of sugar or honey. Two miscarriages were reported in pregnant patients. Only four respondents reported side-effects in other patients, the commonest of which was vomiting. 51% of respondents had started using A. annua tea to treat illnesses other than malaria. Conclusions: Local cultivation and preparation of A. annua are feasible where growing conditions are appropriate. Few adverse events were reported even in children and pregnant women. Where ACT is in short supply, it would make sense to save it for young children, while using A. annua infusions to treat older patients who are at lower risk. An ongoing pharmacovigilance system is needed to facilitate reporting of any adverse events.";"ANTIMALARIAL ACTIVITY; FALCIPARUM-MALARIA; HERBAL TEA; L.";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Climate-related events and natural disasters are severely impacting sexual and reproductive rights as well as the ability of individuals to become parents and care for their children. Through a systematic review conducted using the PRISMA method, this article addresses the impact of the climate crisis on the three core principles of reproductive justice: (1) the right not to have a child; (2) the right to have a child; and (3) the right to parent children in safe and healthy environments. While the review found no empirical studies addressing how the climate crisis impacts the right not to have children, the findings suggest that hurricanes, floods, heatwaves, droughts, and coastal erosion are associated with greater intentions of remaining childless and having fewer children, increasing fetal mortality and preterm births, decreasing new-born sex ratios and birth weight, rising birth risks, declining birth rates, and increasing challenges to parenting and childcare. We argue that the climate crisis fundamentally undermines reproductive justice by preventing individuals from fully and equitably exercising their reproductive rights to have children and to parent in safe and sustainable environments. In doing so, we stress that the climate crisis should be considered when addressing the challenges of reproductive justice and that addressing these challenges requires implementing policies that not only seek to mitigate the effects of climate disruptions but also strengthen the capacity of individuals and communities to adapt to changing environmental conditions, ensuring more sustainable reproductive futures.

Ce faisant, nous soulignons que la crise climatique doit & ecirc;tre prise en compte dans la r & eacute;solution des probl & egrave;mes li & eacute;s & agrave; la justice reproductive, et que s'attaquer & agrave; ces d & eacute;fis suppose la mise en oe uvre de politiques cherchant non seulement & agrave; att & eacute;nuer les effets des d & eacute;r & egrave;glements climatiques, mais aussi & agrave; renforcer la capacit & eacute; des individus et des communaut & eacute;s & agrave; s'adapter aux changements environnementaux, garantissant ainsi un avenir reproductif plus durable. La crisis clim & aacute;tica presenta grandes retos a la justicia reproductiva. Los fen & oacute;menos meteorol & oacute;gicos y los desastres naturales tienen un impacto grave en los derechos sexuales y reproductivos, as & iacute; como en la capacidad de las personas para ser padres y cuidar a sus hijos. Por medio de una revisi & oacute;n sistem & aacute;tica que realizamos utilizando el m & eacute;todo PRISMA, este art & iacute;culo aborda el impacto de la crisis clim & aacute;tica en los tres principios fundamentales de la justicia reproductiva: (1) el derecho a no tener hijos; (2) el derecho a tener hijos; y (3) el derecho a criar los hijos en entornos seguros y sanos. Aunque la revisi & oacute;n no encontr & oacute; ning & uacute;n estudio emp & iacute;rico que aborde c & oacute;mo la crisis clim & aacute;tica afecta el derecho de no tener hijos, los hallazgos indican que los huracanes, las inundaciones, las olas de calor, las sequ & iacute;as y la erosi & oacute;n costera est & aacute;n asociados con mayores intenciones de no tener hijos o de tener menos hijos, mayores tasas de mortalidad fetal y nacimientos prematuros, menores tasas de masculinidad de reci & eacute;n nacidos, bajo peso al nacer, crecientes riesgos en el parto, tasas de natalidad en descenso y crecientes retos para criar y cuidar a los hijos. Argumentamos que la crisis clim & aacute;tica socava fundamentalmente la justicia reproductiva al impedir que las personas ejerzan plena y equitativamente sus derechos reproductivos a tener hijos y criarlos en entornos seguros y sostenibles. Hacemos hincapi & eacute; en que se debe tomar en consideraci & oacute;n la crisis clim & aacute;tica al afrontar los retos de la justicia reproductiva, y que para abordar estos retos es necesario aplicar pol & iacute;ticas que no solo busquen mitigar los efectos de las perturbaciones clim & aacute;ticas, sino que tambi & eacute;n refuercen la capacidad de las personas y las comunidades para adaptarse a las condiciones ambientales cambiantes y as & iacute; garantizar futuros reproductivos m & aacute;s sostenibles.";"climate crisis; climate change; reproductive intentions; pregnancy; birth; fertility; care; reproductive justice; BIRTH OUTCOMES; HEALTH; TEMPERATURE; FERTILITY; EXPOSURE; WEIGHT; ACCESS; WOMEN";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

However, the Court's decision in 'Dobbs versus Jackson Women's Health Organization' in 2022 established that the US Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, effectively overturning the Court's own previous judgment in 'Roe versus Wade' from 1973. How could a decision that overturns the precedent for nationwide access to abortion affect women, children, and physicians? How will state laws impact healthcare equity regarding reproductive rights going forward? How will geography affect who can access care financially, and how will this shape the conditions that unwanted children are born into? This work is a systematic analysis of the impact of overturning 'Roe versus Wade' considering the scientific and medical evidence as well as the conflicting political and moral viewpoints regarding abortion. Furthermore, we make constructive recommendations with a view to detoxifying the inflammatory rhetoric surrounding this topic and protecting key stakeholders such as patients seeking abortion and their physicians.The moment 'Roe v. Wade' was overturned, several US states began to enact laws, both protecting and restricting abortion. California and New York, for example, have since enacted laws that extend protection to both patients seeking abortion and the physicians who provide it. Oklahoma and Texas, on the other hand, have enacted laws that make it more difficult for patients to have abortion access, even after fetal death or when the birthing individual's life is in danger. These differences are likely to exacerbate the healthcare access divide across the country and increase the financial burden for those who can become pregnant. As differences in healthcare access and quality of care increase across the nation, an unmatched demand for maternity care, especially in the most restrictive states, could precipitate increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality while physician shortages are expected to worsen. It will be up to the US Congress to address these differences while weighing competing stakeholder interests. Currently, the nation is at the center of a seismic shift surrounding health policy with laws changing rapidly. This systematic health policy analysis paper will explore what the long-term consequences of this recent Supreme Court decision might look like while considering some of the most recently reported short-term consequences after the landslide decision.";"abortion tourism; health equity; social determinants of health (sdoh); supreme court; roe v; wade; sexual and reproductive health rights policy; public health; elective abortion; abortion; abortion laws and society";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective, randomized clinical trial at our university teaching hospital, we studied 112 primiparous women who sustained a third-degree tear during a 1-year period (July 1998-June 1999); they were randomly selected, at diagnosis, to receive either an overlap or an approximation repair. Obstetric personnel, trained in both methods, carried out the repairs immediately after delivery. Fifty-five women under went an overlap procedure, and 57 women underwent an approximation repair. Outcome measures assessed were symptoms of fecal incontinence, abnormal findings on anal manometry, and abnormal findings on endoanal ultrasonography at 3 months post partum. RESULTS: Obstetric factors, including mode of delivery, birth weight, duration of labor, and episiotomy incidence, did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Experience of the operator, analgesia used, and place of repair were similar in both groups, The median incontinence scores were 0/20 after overlap repair and 2/20 after approximation repair (difference not significant). Eleven women (20%) complained of fecal urgency after overlap repair, in comparison with 17 (30%) after approximation repair (difference not significant). There were no significant differences in either anal manometry or endoanal ultrasonographic results between the 2 groups. Six women (11%) had a significant (>1 quadrant) anal sphincter defect after primary overlap repair, compared with 3 (5%) after approximation repair (difference not significant). Overall, 66% of women had ultrasonographic evidence of a residual full-thickness defect in the external anal sphincter after primary repair. CONCLUSION: The outcome after primary repair of third-degree obstetric tear was similar whether an approximation or an overlap technique was used. Overall symptomatic outcome was flood, although two thirds of women had ultrasonographic evidence of residual anal sphincter damage irrespective of the method of repair.";"obstetric anal sphincter injury; primary repair; approximation and overlap; ANAL-SPHINCTER; FECAL INCONTINENCE; DELIVERY; INJURIES; RUPTURE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The PDA may persist, however, despite optimal neonatological therapy and specific pharmacological intervention, as a hemodynamically relevant connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery stem. In this case the clinical symptoms depend on the extent of the shunt and pulmonary flooding or pulmonary pressure elevation and other concomitant phenomena may result. When preterm and newborn infants are clinically compromised by a large PDA, surgical closure is so far the only alternative to pharmacological treatment. This study investigated whether interventional PDA closure is as effective and safe in preterm infants, full term infants and children weighing < 6 kg as in children with greater body weight. In a retrospective analysis the experiences of two centers which performed interventional PDA closure in preterm and full-term infants and in children with body weight of < 6 kg in the years 2004-2013 were studied. A total of 68 children weighing < 6 kg and with a hemodynamically relevant PDA were included in the analysis: 10 patients were preterm infants, 33 ex-preterm and 25 term. In all preterm and ex-preterm infants attempts to induce PDA closure by pharmacological means had been unsuccessful and in 62 out of 68 (91.2 %) of the infants interventional PDA closure was possible. The smallest patient weighed 2.2 kg, the median weight of the cohort was 3.7 kg (range 2.2-5.93 kg), preterm infants 2.4 kg (range 2.21-2.81 kg) and ex-preterm infants 3.3 kg (range 2.3-5.7 kg). The devices implanted most frequently (22 times) were the ADO II additional size (ADO II AS) and the AVP II (20 times). The most effective procedure was closure with an ADO II AS device, for which the initial closure rate was > 95 %. Device-associated complications were low at 3 % and there were no mortalities. Interventional PDA closure in children (preterm and full term infants) with a hemodynamically relevant PDA and associated clinical symptoms represents a safe and efficient therapy option after the conservative options have been exhausted. The procedure can be applied safely and successfully in children weighing less than 6 kg and as little as 2 kg.";"Ductus arteriosus, patent; Newborn; Heart catheterization; Body weight; Feasibility studies; PREMATURE-INFANTS; INDOMETHACIN; EXPERIENCE; IBUPROFEN; OCCLUDER";"";"";"";"";"German";"JOUR";""

Mortality estimates for the year 2000 from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate, however, that a dozen other risk factors contribute more to global mortality and global burden of disease. Moreover, the state-of-the-art British-sponsored fast track assessments (FTAs) of the global impacts of climate change show that through 2085-2100, climate change would contribute less to human health and environmental threats than other risk factors. Climate change is, therefore, unlikely to be the 21(st) century's most important environmental problem. Combining the FTA results with WHO's mortality estimates indicates that halting climate change would reduce cumulative mortality from hunger, malaria, and coastal flooding, by 4-10 percent in 2085 while the Kyoto Protocol would lower it by 0.4-1 percent. FTA results also show that reducing climate change will increase populations-at-risk from water stress and, possibly, threats to biodiversity. But adaptive measures focused specifically on reducing vulnerability to climate sensitive threats would reduce cumulative mortality by 50-75 percent at a fraction of the Kyoto Protocol's cost without adding to risks from water stress or to biodiversity. Such ""focused adaptation"" would, moreover, reduce major hurdles to the developing world's sustainable economic development, lack of which is the major reason for its vulnerability to climate change (and any other form of adversity). Thus, focused adaptation can combat climate change and advance global well-being, particularly of the world's most vulnerable populations, more effectively than aggressive GHG reductions. Alternatively, these benefits and more - reductions in poverty, and infant and maternal mortality by 50-75%; increased access to safe water and sanitation; and universal literacy - can be obtained by broadly advancing sustainable economic development through policies, institutions and measures (such as those that would meet the UN Millennium Development Goals) at a cost approximating that of the Kyoto Protocol. However, in order to deal with climate change beyond the 20852100 timeframe, the paper also recommends expanding research and development of mitigation options, reducing barriers to implementing such options, and active science and monitoring programs to provide early warning of any ""dangerous"" climate change impacts.";"SRES EMISSIONS; IMPACTS; CO2; MITIGATION; RISK";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Occasionally the cellular O-2 requirement becomes critical and an O-2 deficit in blood (hypoxemia) may evolve to a tissue deficit (hypoxia) and finally a risk of organ damage (asphyxia). An increase in Hthorn concentration is reflected in a decrease in pH, which together with increased base deficit is a proxy for the level of fetal O-2 deficit. Base deficit (or its negative value, base excess) was introduced to reflect the metabolic component of a low pH and to distinguish from the respiratory cause of a low pH, which is a high CO2 concentration. Base deficit is a theoretical estimate and not a measured parameter, calculated by the blood gas analyzer from values of pH, the partial pressure of CO2, and hemoglobin. Different brands of analyzers use different calculation equations, and base deficit values can thus differ by multiples. This could influence the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis, which is commonly defined as a pH <7.00 combined with a base deficit >= 12.0 mmol/L in umbilical cord arterial blood. Base deficit can be calculated as base deficit in blood (or actual base deficit) or base deficit in extracellular fluid (or standard base deficit). The extracellular fluid compartment represents the blood volume diluted with the interstitial fluid. Base deficit in extracellular fluid is advocated for fetal blood because a high partial pressure of CO2 (hypercapnia) is common in newborns without concomitant hypoxia, and hypercapnia has a strong influence on the pH value, then termed respiratory acidosis. An increase in partial pressure of CO2 causes less increase in base deficit in extracellular fluid than in base deficit in blood, thus base deficit in extracellular fluid better represents the metabolic component of acidosis. The different types of base deficit for defining metabolic acidosis in cord blood have unfortunately not been noticed by many obstetrical experts and organizations. In addition to an increase in Hthorn concentration, the lactate production is accelerated during hypoxia and anaerobic metabolism. There is no global consensus on definitions of normal cord blood gases and lactate, and different cutoff values for abnormality are used. At a pH <7.20, 7% to 9% of newborns are deemed academic; at <7.10, 1% to 3%; and at <7.00, 0.26% to 1.3%. From numerous studies of different eras and sizes, it can firmly be concluded that in the cord artery, the statistically defined lower pH limit (mean -2 standard deviations) is 7.10. Given that the pH for optimal enzyme activity differs between different cell types and organs, it seems difficult to establish a general biologically critical pH limit. The blood gases and lactate in cord blood change with the progression of pregnancy toward a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidemia because of increased metabolism and CO2 production in the growing fetus. Gestational age-adjusted normal reference values have accordingly been published for pH and lactate, and they associate with Apgar score slightly better than stationary cutoffs, but they are not widely used in clinical practice. On the basis of good-quality data, it is reasonable to set a cord artery lactate cutoff (mean thorn2 standard deviations) at 10 mmol/L at 39 to 40 weeks' gestation. For base deficit, it is not possible to establish statistically defined reference values because base deficit is calculated with different equations, and there is no consensus on which to use. Arterial cord blood represents the fetus better than venous blood, and samples from both vessels are needed to validate the arterial origin. A venoarterial pH gradient of<0.02 is commonly used to differentiate arterial from venous samples. Reference values for pH in cord venous blood have been determined, but venous blood comes from the placenta after clearance of a surplus of arterial CO2, and base deficit in venous blood then overestimates the metabolic component of fetal acidosis. The ambition to increase neonatal hemoglobin and iron depots by delaying cord clamping after birth results in falsely acidic blood gas and lactate values if the blood sampling is also delayed. Within seconds after birth, sour metabolites accumulated in peripheral tissues and organs will flood into the central circulation and further to the cord arteries when the newborn starts to breathe, move, and cry. This influence of ""hidden acidosis"" can be avoided by needle puncture of unclamped cord vessels and blood collection immediately after birth. Because of a continuing anaerobic glycolysis in the collected blood, it should be analyzed within 5 minutes to not result in a falsely high lactate value. If the syringe is placed in ice slurry, the time limit is 20 minutes. For pH, it is reasonable to wait no longer than 15 minutes if not in ice. Routine analyses of cord blood gases enable perinatal audits to gain the wisdom of hindsight, to maintain quality assurance at a maternity unit over years by following the rate of neonatal acidosis, to compare results between hospitals on regional or national bases, and to obtain an objective outcome measure in clinical research. Given that the intrapartum cardiotocogram is an uncertain proxy for fetal hypoxia, and there is no strong correlation between pathologic cardiotocograms and fetal acidosis, a cord artery pH may help rather than hurt a staff person subjected to a malpractice suit based on undesirable cardiotocogram patterns. Contrary to common beliefs and assumptions, up to 90% of cases of cerebral palsy do not originate from intrapartum events. Future research will elucidate whether cell injury markers with point-of-care analysis will become valuable in improving the dating of perinatal injuries and differentiating hypoxic from nonhypoxic injuries.";"acidemia; acidosis; Apgar; asphyxia; base deficit; base excess; birth; cerebral palsy; cord blood analysis; cord blood gases; encephalopathy; hypoxia; lactate; metabolic acidosis; neonatal outcome; perinatal outcome; pH; pregnancy; HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; ACID-BASE STATUS; FOR-GESTATIONAL-AGE; VELOCITY WAVE-FORMS; METABOLIC-ACIDOSIS; ARTERIAL-BLOOD; APGAR SCORE; NEONATAL COMPLICATIONS; PREDICTIVE VALUE; NEWBORN-INFANTS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Using the rich source of ethnographic data on child-death and mortuary practices among Southeast Bantu speakers, we explore the cultural significance and symbolic meaning of an infant pot burial uncovered on Melora Saddle, an early nineteenth-century African farmer settlement on the Waterberg Plateau, Limpopo Province. The skeletal remains belong to a perinatal individual, aged between 34 weeks gestation and newborn. The short-necked jar was interred in an upright position either inside, or close to, a house. Ethnographic data show that a conceptual link was made between a woman's reproductive capacity and the land's fertility, as well as between potting and procreation. A close symbolic link existed between pots, wombs, mothers and their houses. Child-birth and child-death were fraught with ritual danger that had to be averted to ensure the well-being of the family and the community. Any deviations from the natural order of things generated pollution (heat or dirt), which threatened a woman's fertility and a lineage's continuation. Such ritual impurity not only destabilised the social order, but also disturbed the natural order, as a result of which the rains, the ultimate sign of a community's well-being, might stay away. To counter the ritual danger, and thereby to restore a woman's fertility and avoid a drought, foetuses and infants were buried in jars, either in a cool, wet place in the bank of a river, or inside a house or in the shade under its eaves. As in the case of the Melora Saddle jar, the bases of such burial vessels were often deliberately perforated, evidently a symbolic act to ensure that a woman would become pregnant again. Ash, representing an extinguished fire, served as an important cooling agent in such burials, which would account for the location of several midden burials uncovered in Iron Age sites.";"fertility; foetus; miscarriage; neonate; perinatal; pollution; pot burial; ritual impurity; symbolisation; uterus; Iron Age; Waterberg";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Some authors consider these two forms as separate species, while others classify them as merely subspecies or races which are closely related. In this study, we compare the geographic distribution, morphological characteristics, karyotypes, biochemical variability, and potential for hybridisation of European and Siberian roe deer, addressing the question of their phylogenetic status. For most of historical times, the ranges of these two forms have been independent due to physical barriers such as glaciers or flooding. Overlap occurred for a time in the Middle Ages and again more recently, for the Last few decades, but even then, the potential hybrid zone was small and hybrids are not thought to have persisted. The Siberian roe deer is substantially Larger than its European counterpart in all body measurements, with only the very smallest Siberian individuals and the very largest European deer of approximately equivalent size. Furthermore, the two forms can be reliably distinguished on the basis of cranial shape, due to differential rates of growth of the skull, illustrating the hiatus in morphology between the two forms. All European roe have a karyotype of 2n = 70, while Siberian roe possess between 1 and 14 additional accessory B-chromosomes, increasing clinally from west to east. Changes in karyotype seem to occur at physical boundaries, suggesting the differences are due to partial or total absence of gene flow. On the basis of polymorphism of several enzymes as well as blood and muscle proteins, the genetic distance between the two forms is characteristic of fairly reliable species. A series of hybridisation experiments have illustrated that, although successful crosses can be achieved, they more often result in stillbirths or birth complications Leading to the death of both mother and kid, and reduced or complete infertility among F1 hybrid bucks. It is Likely therefore that hybridisation in the wild would be rare or absent, and that hybrids would not persist in the face of immigration of either pure form.

At the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000, 189 member States adopted a declaration that synthesized the priorities of the international agenda and reflected the commitments that had been painstakingly negotiated. The Millennium Declaration and the eight goals it identified have become a road map for tackling poverty, instability, HIV/AIDS, gender inequality, and violence in virtually all parts of the world. The International Potato Center (CIP)'s vision is to contribute to the fulfillment of the Millennium Development Goals, in particular those that relate to reducing poverty, hunger, child and maternal mortality, and sustainable development in rural and urban systems. New research with this valuable genetic resource targeting micronutrient levels, production, stress tolerance, and value adding for new markets is invigorating farming communities in the Andean center of origin and diversity of potato. Fe content (on a dry weight basis) is comparable to levels found in some cereals (rice, maize and wheat), but with better bio-availability due to lower phytate and higher ascorbic acid contents. A food intake study was carried out in six locations in Huancavelica to gain understanding of the role of the potato in the Andean diet, with an emphasis on women and children as the most vulnerable to malnutrition. Resulting information is being used to identify varieties with higher levels of Fe and Zn to improve micronutrient intake and simultaneously to assess the potential for enhancing Fe and Zn concentration through breeding and selection. An impressive range of 17-33% dry matter was found in a large number of native varieties, significantly higher than a control group of improved varieties, which contained 22-27% (Amoros et al., 2006). The outstanding organoleptic properties of many of the diploid and tetraploid native potatoes, as well as the relatively high contents identified for Fe and Zn (Burgos et al., 2007) and the antioxidant properties of those with high contents of anthocyanins (Culley et al., 2003.) are aimed at strengthening traditional Andean farming systems and benefiting potato farmers and consumers across the globe.";"Solanum tuberosum; andean culture; genetic diversity; drought tolerance; nutrition; breeding for increased micronutrients; improving livelihoods";"";"";"";"";"English";"CPAPER";""

The Horn of Africa, which includes eastern Ethiopia, northeast Kenya, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Somalia, has natural characteristics that favor high groundwater salinity. Excess salinity has been linked to infrastructure and health problems, including increased infant mortality. This region has suffered successive droughts that have limited the availability of safe drinking water resources, leading to a humanitarian crisis for which little spatially explicit information about groundwater salinity is available. Methods: Machine learning (random forest) is used to make spatial predictions of salinity levels at three electrical conductivity (EC) thresholds using data from 8646 boreholes and wells along with environmental predictor variables. Attention is paid to understanding the input data, balancing classes, performing many iterations, specifying cut-off values, employing spatial cross-validation, and identifying spatial uncertainties. Results: Estimates are made for this transboundary region of the population potentially exposed to hazardous salinity levels. The findings indicate that about 11.6 million people (similar to 7% of the total population), including 400,000 infants and half a million pregnant women, rely on groundwater for drinking and live in areas of high groundwater salinity (EC > 1500 mu S/cm). Somalia is the most affected and has the largest number of people potentially exposed. Around 50% of the Somali population (5 million people) may be exposed to unsafe salinity levels in their drinking water. In only five of Somalia's 18 regions are less than 50% of infants potentially exposed to unsafe salinity levels. The main drivers of high salinity include precipitation, groundwater recharge, evapo-ration, ocean proximity, and fractured rocks. The combined overall accuracy and area under the curve of multiple runs is similar to 82%. Conclusions: The modelled groundwater salinity maps for three different salinity thresholds in the Horn of Africa highlight the uneven spatial distribution of salinity in the studied countries and the large area affected, which is mainly arid flat lowlands. The results of this study provide the first detailed mapping of groundwater salinity in the region, providing essential information for water and health scientists along with decision-makers to identify and prioritize areas and populations in need of assistance.";"Drinking water; Groundwater quality; Water scarcity; Human health; Djibouti; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Kenya; Somalia; Spatial modeling; Machine learning; Random forest; DRINKING-WATER SALINITY; DYNAMICS; SODIUM; SYSTEM; HEALTH; TOOL";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Some strains of E. coli, an indicator microorganism, when transported over and/or through the soils reaching the water resources, cause urinary tract infections, diarrheal diseases, and contribute to infant mortality, fatal renal or neurological complications. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no information about the bacterial transport through natural/intact calcareous and gypsiferous soils. In this study, we selected four soil types to investigate the influence of lime and gypsum content on transport and filtration of E. coli released from cow manure during saturated and unsaturated flows. Intact soil columns from Hamadan and Isfahan provinces in Iran were transported to the laboratory. Cow manure was applied to the surface of each column at a rate of 10 Mg ha(-1) dry basis. Soil columns were leached up to four pore volumes (PVs) at 20 degrees C. E. coli influent (C-o) and effluent (C) concentrations were measured by the plate-count method and C-o/C values were drawn vs. PV as breakthrough curves (BTCs). Filtration coefficient (lambda(f)), relative adsorption index (S-R), and maximum depth of potential contamination (Z(max)) were calculated as indices of filtration and transport processes. Our results illustrated that contamination of water is possible where flooding irrigation systems occur in the low-lime soil due to low ionic strength and salinity, and greater structural stability. The BTCs showed that preferential pathways are greater in the low-lime soils than in the other studied soils. The presence of the natural lime and gypsum affected solution chemistry, macro and microporosity of the studied soils, which resulted in more bacterial filtration. The soils high in lime and gypsum also had maximum values for lambda(f) and S-R, respectively. Minimum Z(max) was observed in the high-lime soil and its mean was significantly lower than in the three other soils. The Z(max) was greater in saturated flow conditions than in unsaturated flow conditions. Overall, when a source of E. coli (e.g. cow manure) is applied on a low-lime or gypsum soil, subsurface water contamination would be expected while high-lime and gypsum soils could filter more bacteria. This study showed the effect of natural lime and gypsum on bacterial transportation through intact soils. It is suggested to use techniques such as scanning electron microscope (SEM) and image analysis to present pore-scale information for bacterial movement through calcareous and gypsiferous soils.

Commercially available vaccines against leptospirosis offer limited protection to cattle because they contain only the most prevalent serovars worldwide, even though they are not prevalent in the specific region. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of specific antibodies against Leptospira serogroups, reproductive disorders and the risk factors in dairy herds from different mesoregions of Rio Grande do Sul State, Southern Brazil. Materials, Methods & Results: An epidemiological survey was conducted, and serum samples from the bovine population representative of three mesoregions (MR 1, MR2, and MR3) were studied; the samples were collected and tested for leptospirosis using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for 12 serogroups checking for the presence of agglutination. A total of 442 blood samples were collected from dairy cattle from November to December 2019 (MR1, 187; MR2, 88; and MR3, 167), including cows vaccinated with different commercial vaccines during the three months before sample collection (n = 295) and non-vaccinated against leptospirosis (n = 147). At the time of collection, an interview was conducted with the owners with questions about the health of the animals, management, habitat, feeding and reproduction. Chi-square tests univariate analysis with the SPSS (R) version 20.0 were performed to estimate the association of serogroup Djasiman seroreactivity with the occurrence of reproductive problems and related risk factors. The mean prevalence of antibodies against leptospires was 78.7% (MR1, 74.9 %; MR2, 84.1 %; and MR3, 80.2 %). Serogroup prevalence was different in each mesoregion evaluated and varied with vaccination status tested of the animals. The most prevalent serogroups in MR1 were Djasiman and Icterohaemorrhagiae. In MR2 and MR3, Djasiman was the most prevalent serogroup, regardless of vaccination status. Other prevalent serogroups in vaccinated animals were Icterohaemorrhagiae (MR1), Sejroe (MR2), Pomona, Sejroe, and Icterohaemorrhagiae (MR3). The other serovars tested had a prevalence of less or equal than 2%. The occurrence of reproductive problems with abortions and estrus repetition, was associated with reactivity to the serogroup Djasiman (P > 0.05). The results showed that the access of animals to flooded areas and the presence of rodents were significant risk factors, according to the literature. Discussion: The prevalence of antibodies against Leptospira in the studied areas was higher than expected, with a high prevalence of Djasiman serogroup. It is important to note that this serogroup is not present in current vaccine formulations. The presence of wetlands and rodents as risk factors in association with Djasiman is consistent with the scientific literature, since wild rodents are natural hosts, and swampy areas may allow Leptospira to survive for up to 180 days in the environment. Due to the presence and high prevalence found of the serogroup Djasiman in the experiment, new studies are being carried out to improve our knowledge about this serogroup and its possible inclusion in a commercial vaccine. Prophylaxis and control measures were recommended to rural producers in the analyzed properties.";"bovine leptospirosis; herds; zoonosis; antibodies; reproductive disorders; leptospires; Djasiman; RIO-DE-JANEIRO; PROTECTION; VIRULENCE; VACCINES; REVEALS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

There are several causes, one of which is the ingestion of toxic plants. Considering the importance of native toxic plants in the Central Backlands of Ceara state - Brazil, this paper reports cases of congenital malformations in sheep due to ingestion of Mimosa tenuiflora. Cases: Cases of abortion and malformations in sheep, were monitored in a rural property in the municipality of Piquet Cameiro with 20 ruminants (15 sheep and 5 cows) raised on a semi-intensive regime. The animals grazed during the day and were supplemented with corn, having unrestricted access to dam water. On its margins, there was a large amount of jurema preta (Mimosa tenuiflora), which the owner reported that the sheep consumed daily. The owner was unaware of the toxicity of M. tenuiflora but reported that cases of malformations had already occurred on his property some time ago. In an interval of approximately 12 days, 3 sheep miscarriage fetuses with multiple malformations. Malformed fetuses were referred for anatomopathological examination at the Animal Pathology Laboratory of the Veterinary Hospital of Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), Campus Patos, Paraiba, Brazil. The fetuses were necropsied and tissue samples of the nervous system and organs from the thoracic and abdominal cavities were collected, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, routinely processed for histopathology, included in paraffin, cut into 3 mu m sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). At necropsies were observed permanent contracture of the thoracic limb joints (arthrogryposis), particularly at the radio-carpal joints; incomplete medial fusion of the palatal bone, with communication between the oral and nasal cavities (palatoschisis); hypoplasia of the mandibular bone (micrognathia); unilateral hypoplasia of the incisive bone with discontinuity of the upper lip (cheiloschisis); unilateral hypoplasia of the eyeball (microphthahnia); lateral curvature of the cervical spine (scoliosis); and chest deformity characterized by ventral protrusion of the sternum and ribs (Pectus carinatum). At the histopathological evaluation of the tissues, no alterations were observed. Discussion: The diagnosis was based on the epidemiological, clinical, and anatomopathological findings. The semi-intensive management system applied on the property predisposed the sheep to ingestion of M. tenuiflora, which grows abundantly on the property and throughout the Central Backlands of Ceara, Brazil, with a high rate of geographical coverage. Despite that, most rural producers, especially subsistence farmers, are unaware of the toxic and teratogenic properties of the plant. In the northeastern, where there are long periods of drought coupled with forage shortages, poisoning by M. tenuiflora is a common cause of malformation and mortality in lambs. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt preventive measures in herds, such as raising awareness among producers about the toxic potential of some native plants and the practice of producing and supplying silage to animals, so that native toxic plants are not the only food source during the scarcity period.";"arthrogryposis; jurema preta; anomalies; cleft lip; toxic plants; PLANT POISONINGS; RUMINANTS; PARAIBA";"";"";"";"";"Portuguese";"JOUR";""

It should be noted that Malaysia is not new to such experiences as the Asian rare-earth project in the 1980s proved very costly causing rash of birth defects, painful miscarriages, and leukemia cases because of radioactive waste. This paper highlights the needs that future energy needs and economic targets can be overcome through other sources probably investing in renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydropower. Should Malaysia go nuclear to meet its future energy demands? Is Lynas Rare-earth Project environment friendly? These questions have been the focus of heated political debate in Malaysia for the last eight years. Mahathir Mohamad, who served as prime minister from 1981 to 2003, was firmly committed to a non-nuclear Malaysia. But since his departure, his successors have made some moves toward nuclear energy production. For example, in December 2010 Malaysia's energy minister Peter Chin announced plans to build two 1,000-megawatt nuclear power plants by 2022. A month later, Prime Minister Najib Razak announced the establishment of the Malaysian Nuclear Power Corporation, which will lead the planning process. The Fukushima nuclear accident, however, has raised new doubts about whether Malaysia is ready for nuclear power. Malaysian experts disagree over the need for nuclear power plants, and their potential impacts on public safety and the environment. There is little doubt that Malaysia must develop new energy sources to meet its future energy demands without relying on costly foreign imports. But we believe that these demands can be met with renewable energy instead. Hence, the Bukit Merah incident is still fresh in the minds of the public and recent nuclear incident in Japan has further fueled controversy on the issue. The residents were particularly concerned over the effects of the emission from the plant and its radioactive waste on the health and safety of their families. In addition, the construction of Lynas Rare-earth project is also an issue of concern in Malaysia. Rare-earth can be defined as a group of metal elements comprises 15 types of lanthanides and also Scandium and Yattrium. In fact, all these 17 elements are profuse in the environment. Nevertheless, these elements cannot easily be browbeaten as they likely to be discrete and not rigorous at a meticulous area. These elements are highly obsessive for manufacturing high tech goods like electric car, smart-phones and fiber optic cables. So far, China has been the monopoly of rare-earth that produces more than 90 % of the rare earth supplies throughout the world. Recently, Malaysian government has given approval to an Australian listed Lynas Corp Ltd to install plants in Malaysia to transport processed raw material in Pahang. Lynas Corp Ltd owns a huge deposit of such elements at Mount Weld Australia in order to generate a steadfast and incorporated resource of Rare Earths supply to patrons in the global Rare Earths industry. The company's new plan is to process raw material in Mount Weld and transport it to Advanced Materials Plant in Malaysia. The capital cost for both these plants, concentration plant in Australia and advanced material plant in Malaysia is estimated at A$339.19 million. An important question that pinches our minds is that why Malaysia was chosen for this purpose? According to Lynas, it initially planned to install the plant solely in Australia but several factors did not favor this plan, for example, shortage of water, location that could be suitable for all infrastructure needs, short supply of engineering and construction skills and additionally industrial and port capacity. The plan was also under consideration in China that produces more than 90 % of the rare earth supplies throughout the world. But because of the Chinese government decision to impose export limits on products and also applied import and export taxes up to 25% on final products specially on rare earth. Alternatively, Lynas has picked Malaysia as the favorite location mainly because of its immediacy to market, access to high quality chemicals, utilities and engineering skills and also its transparent regulatory framework. The Lynas Rare Earth project is comprised of two plants: Concentration plant at Mount Weld and an advanced material plant in Malaysia. The phase 1 is expected to produce 11000t REO annually and the phase 2 is likely to increase this capacity up to 22,000t REO by the year 2013. Both phases aim at the construction of the Concentration plant at Mount Weld and also an advanced material plant to process the concentrate through to final Rare Earths oxides in the Gebeng Industrial Estate, Pahang, Malaysia. Lynas has received all required approvals to construct both plants. The estimated capital cost to complete Phase 1 of both the Concentration Plant in Western Australia and the Advanced Materials Plant in Malaysia is A$339.19 million and as a whole it is estimated at $407.32 million. Lynas says that it has got approval for the construction of both plants. The Malaysian interest in the project remains in two main areas: first, it will enable generate revenues amounting up to one per cent of the Malaysian GDP and secondly, it will create hundreds of jobs for the people in connection with the plant.";"Nuclear; Malaysia; Renewable Energy";"";"";"";"";"English";"CPAPER";""

By definition desertification is a subset of land degradation confined to drylands, thus adding ""land degradation"" to ""desertification"" implies relevance of the UNCCD to land degradation in both drylands and non-drylands, globally and in the Mediterranean. Another interpretation for pairing ""desertification"" and ""land degradation"" is that desertification is not a globally spatial but a dryland temporal subset of land degradation; namely ""desertification"" represents culmination of the process of land degradation in the drylands. The UNCCD usage of ""desertification"" (to be combated) in conjunction with drought (to be mitigated) and climatic variations (a desertification driver) also confounds understanding and assessment of desertification and its status. Qualifying desertification its a persistent reduction of biological productivity in the drylands may resolve difficulties in addressing desertification, though no agreement exists as to what degree of degradation and its reversibility properties would qualify as desertification. Desertification is habitually believed to be driven by human impact proportional to Population size and growth rate, which are higher than the global average and relative to all other ecosystems, respectively. Global scale data demonstrating that desertification is highest at the intermediate section of the aridity gradient suggest that desertification is driven by an interaction of ecosystem sensitivity (expressed by natural biological productivity) and the pressure exerted on land resources (expressed by population density). Yet, though GDP and infant mortality rates are lower and higher in drylands, relatively to other ecosystems and to global averages, respectively, it is not known if the drylands' low human well-being is driven by desertification, or by the inherently low productivity of drylands impacted by growing populations, or both. Thus desertification constitutes a paradigm, one of a downward spiral of degradation leading to human misery, through self-reinforcing positive feedback loops. This paradigm is reinforced by an environmental security narrative, in which migrations and conflicts driven by the desertification-associated demand and supply-induced environmental scarcities, reduce overall environmental security in the drylands. A ""counter paradigm"" based on some evidence suggests that drylands' adversities trigger ""induced innovations"" in rural communities that lead to development tracks which circumvent desertification. Yet, if dryland population continues to increase the ""induced ingenuity"" will eventually be exhausted, unless dryland livelihoods independent of land productivity are gradually adopted. Mediterranean climates, of wet winters but dry summers, prevail in five seaboard semiarid and dry-subhumid regions on the globe, one of which is the Mediterranean Basin, with a long history of intensive use by man resulting in biological adaptations providing high ecosystem resilience to human impact. The southern, African lands of the Mediterranean Basin are drier than the northern, European lands, the latter being mainly semiarid drylands, with high desertification extent, yet more people are affected by desertification in the southern than in the northern sections of the Basin. All over the Mediterranean Basin the most extensively used land is also the most intensively used and becoming most degraded, irrespective of type of use. Thus in the northern Mediterranean desertification is driven by irrigation developments, themselves driven by markets and regional agricultural policies, whereas in the Southern Mediterranean desertification is driven by encroachment of cultivation on rangelands, which are driven by population growth and national policies. Yet, the Mediterranean ecosystems are fairly resilient to mounting external pressures, due to a balance in the interaction of soil state with soil vegetation cover, up to a point in which a threshold is crossed. A way to avoid desertification in grazed Mediterranean shrublands is to encourage the historical prevalence of a spatio-temporal mosaic of distinct patches of annual and perennial vegetation through controlling grazing and fire at moderate levels, and moving these controls adaptively and dynamically between patches. Yet, when degradation did take over, rehabilitation through afforestation have taken place on a large scale in the Mediterranean Basin. This afforestation, mainly with Aleppo Pine, reduced soil erosion and flooding but compromised water resources and poorly performed in restoring the indigenous vegetation cover, but seemed to be more successful and water-efficient in drier areas, where the objective was soil conservation rather than the vegetation restoration. Global climate change is projected to exert an additional pressure on the Mediterranean drylands, through an overall decrease in water resources, such that even a relatively small climatic change would suffice to initiate a spatio-temporal transformation of the Mediterranean semiarid to arid drylands, and also an overall transformation of non-drylands into drylands, in both their climate and their biological productivity. Given the projected combined impacts of global climate change, dryland population growth and the pressure on drylands brought about by global decline in good cultivable land, it may be effective to address Mediterranean desertification as an environmental security issue, which encompasses risking food security, health security, livelihood security, national and transboundary security. However, the direct links between desertification and migration within the Mediterranean Basin have not yet been demonstrated. Even though means to promote land productivity improve, an eventual widespread desertification leading to reduced human well-being, land desertion and migration can emerge in the Mediterranean Basin. A way out is to explore means of diversifying dryland livelihoods, such that the pressure on land resources is reduced yet dryland people opt to stay on their land. Paradoxically, with all its drawbacks, global climate change provides opportunities to people of the Mediterranean drylands, encouraging them to diversify their livelihoods, e.g. afforestation in the non-desert Mediterranean drylands for carbon trading, and solar energy development in the desert drylands for exporting electricity. These and other livelihoods of advantage in drylands yet not depending on dryland land resources can be mixed with improvements of traditional dryland livelihoods. Thus the flows between the southern and northern Mediterranean may dramatically transform - rather than development aid cash, payments for purchases of clean energy would flow from the North to the South, and the South-North flow of migrants would be replaced by North-South flow of tourists. These changes would promote the sustainability of dryland livelihoods especially in the South, and would bring abut environmental security and Subsequent political stability throughout the Mediterranean Basin.";"ENVIRONMENT; RAINFALL; AFRICA";"";"";"";"";"English";"CPAPER";""

The growth parameters (A: maturity weight, B: growth rate, and K: maturity rate) were calculated using Gompertz, Logistic, Brody, and Von Bertalanffy nonlinear models via NLIN procedure of SAS software. The aforementioned models were compared using Akaike information criterion, root mean square error, adjusted co-efficient of determination. Also, both Bayesian (using MTGSAM) and RMEL (using WOMBAT) paradigms were adapted to predict the genetic (co)variance components of growth parameters (A, B, K) due to the best fitted growth models. It was turned out that Von Bertalanffy best fitted to the data in this study. The year of birth and lamb gender had a significant effect on maturity rate (P < 0.01). Also it turned out that within the growth parameter, with increasing (co)variance matrix complexity, the Bayesian paradigm fitted well to the data than the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) one. However, for simple animal model and across all growth parameters, REML outperformed Bayesian. In this way, the h(a)(2) predicted (0.15 & PLUSMN; 0.05), (0.11 & PLUSMN;.05), and (0.04 & PLUSMN; 0.03) for A, B, and K parameters, respectively. Practically, in terms of breeding plan, we could see that genetic improvement of growth parameters in this study is not a tractable strategy to follow up and improvement of the management and environment should be thoroughly considered. In terms of paradigm comparison, REML's bias correction bears up an advantageous approach as far as we are concerned with small sample size. To this end, REML predictions are fairly accurate but the mode of posterior distributions could be overestimated. Finally, the differences between REML and Bayesian estimates were found for all parameter data in this study. We conclude that simulation studies are necessary in order to trade off these parading in the complex random effects scenarios of genetic individual model. Lay Summary The Iran plateau is known to be the origin of many sheep species nowadays. In Iran, different production systems are operated ranging from intensive to lower-input/extensive ones. However, the majority of these sheep breeds are extensively managed, where lambs are born outside and with little intervention and generally they experience frequent drought and shortage of nutritional value of forages. Meanwhile, the weight of lambs as a whole play a major decision role in rearing or culling them. However, investigations involving the possible genetic improvement of lamb weights over different periods of time have found low genetic variations. This study serves to be comprehensive in addressing this issue in Moghani sheep breed. Fitting many different genetics models over both restricted maximum likelihood and Bayesian paradigms indicated that heritability of weight spanned 0.03 to 0.23. The low genetic variation would lead to recommendations that the improvement of Moghani lamb weights should rather be based upon modification of the environment to create conditions suitable for weight of lambs. This reflects that breeders of Moghani sheep breed have less options to tackle Iran harsh conditions using Moghani sheep genetic potentials. One of the main challenges in estimation of genetic variance components, a cornerstone of breeding schemes, is choosing the right paradigm for estimation of aforementioned components. In this study, we showed that by increasing the number and complexity of variance components, Bayesian paradigm overtakes restricted maximum likelihood in terms of explaining much better the data.";"Bayesian; growth parameters; Moghani Sheep; nonlinear; REML; NONLINEAR FUNCTION; MODELS; DESCRIBE; PARAMETERS; BREED";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Some are trying to integrate and make homes in new countries. Still more people are coming in perilous flight from the unfurling effects of climate change. 'We are place-lings,' according to Ed Casey, 'never without emplaced experiences'. Lorraine Code, explaining our social and geographical embeddedness and interdependence, describes us as 'ecological subjects'. By recognizing place, we can deepen our appreciation for the ways in which we are radically relational, that is, interdependent with people, non-human others, and particular locations. This robust and realistic conception of our relational nature and its implications for health and ethics deserves more attention. Elsewhere I have argued for 'ethical place-making' as morally obligatory for supporting the capability to be healthy, or health justice, for ecological subjects. Drawing on this conception of persons as creatures situated in specific social relations, geographic locations, and atmospheric and material environments, here I emphasize the importance of place and argue for an ideal and practice of 'ethical place-making' as an essential and, indeed, ethically required way of demonstrating and forging future solidarity and advancing justice, particularly health justice. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I explain what I mean by place and examine the relationships, revealed by contemporary research in social epidemiology, between place and health. In Section 3, I build on the conception of persons as ecological subjects to ground what Carol Gould has called 'solidaristic recognition', which, as I will interpret it, requires us to reckon with the significance of place in our relational nature. I then link solidaristic recognition to the ideal and practice of ethical place-making and, in turn, the capability to be healthy, that is, health justice. I argue that place-based interventions should be principal and prioritized ways of showing solidarity and promoting justice - especially health justice - for ecological subjects, above all those who are displaced and/or insecurely placed. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, ethical place-making has the potential to catalyze and nurture them and, over time, to advance justice. A full discussion of the complex and contested relationship between solidarity and global justice is beyond the scope of what I can expound on here; I follow - and present concrete manifestations of - the views of Iris Marion Young and Carol Gould in seeing solidarity as having, as Gould puts it, a crucial 'role not only in motivating people's commitment to the realization of global justice but [also] contribut[ing] to its construction or constitution.' In Section 4, I present examples of ethical place-making inspired by solidaristic recognition in a range of domains significant for bioethics - clinical and long-term care and urban planning in the United States and Netherlands, and refugee care and resettlement in Lebanon and Germany. In the cases presented, I describe how the particular elements of ethical place-making, emerging from solidaristic recognition, are realized, and so support the conditions for the capability to healthy, or health justice. Following this discussion, I move on to the conclusion. Place 'is no fixed thing'. The accounts of geographers, philosophers, and some architects emphasize our embodied experience in or around place(s), place's significance for the development of our subjectivity and identity, and, finally, the complex social processes that help to create, maintain, and transform places (and, in turn, bodies and subjectivities). The understanding I follow here defines 'place' in terms of the material environment, and how we, as embodied beings, move in, absorb, shape and are shaped by it, and how we, as social agents, interact with and within it, gather and attach particular meanings, and forge relationships and identities. A growing body of research in social epidemiology using realist methods explains in increasingly rich, if grim, detail the ways in which social conditions and features of the external environment, including place-related factors, affect health and longevity, and contribute to preventable health inequities. We are talking about components of the built environment, like land use, housing design, materials and quality, street layout and transportation, exposure to toxins, and violence, access to food and activity options; and urban design or decline. Air and water quality, and access to green space are other place-related factors. We should also include climate and the potential in specific locations for climate-related disasters in our scope of concern. So-called 'determinants' such as these operate independently and interactively at various levels and in different contexts to generate harms to health and health inequities. On terrain more typical for bioethics, clinical and other care settings, as currently configured, are notoriously disorienting, anxiety-inducing, and in some ways dangerous for physical, psychological, and existential health. Researchers have detailed a range of effects of institutional design, including the effects of noise and light on recovery times, and the ways architecture can shape interactions and experiences. Long-term care settings are infamous for poor conditions. A lack of light, private space, and access to the outdoors, for example, and isolation from broader social surroundings, adversely affect the health of elderly people. People fleeing war, persecution, and famine endure desperate conditions that threaten health. Many reside in camps (in the form of transit camps and official refugee camps, detention centers, etc. ) while others dwell in slums or other settlements - primarily in urban areas - segregated from the majority population. These people suffer from a range of complex physical and mental health conditions. Before or during transit and in camps and other settings, they face food insecurity, risk of communicable disease, fear, violence, loss, and other experiences. If there is access to health services it is often restricted to acute medical care, and not equipped to adequately address chronic or mental health conditions or the social determinants of health needs. Migrants and asylum-seeking people thus lack crucial capabilities to be healthy. It is not that a relationship between place and health is a modern epiphany. Hippocrates' Airs, waters, and places, the epidemiological work of Louis-Rene Villerme and Rudolph Virchow in the 19th century, and the histories of public health and urban planning, all recognized the importance of environmental conditions. The asylums for the mentally ill in the late 19th century reveal an attention, if not yet evidence-based, for place in care and healing. Inspired by the Moral Treatment movement, New Enlightenment intellectuals, and health advocates like Dorthea Dix, Thomas Kirkbride established professional guidelines on institutional layout and room design for patients. Realist methods in social epidemiology, more recently, have deepened our appreciation and understanding of the processes at work on our corporeal nature, and our entanglement with the world around us. We are situated socially, materially, and geographically, and vulnerable as creatures who need care and who also need to 'fit' with the places in which we dwell and through which we navigate. We are, in short, ecological subjects, beings for whom social interdependence and geographic locatedness are vital. As I will argue below, health justice, or the capability to be healthy, therefore demands thoughtful attention to place and the conditions that create and sustain places. In the next section, I explain the relationship between recognizing people as ecological subjects and the ideal and practice of solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it, refers to reaching out through engaging our moral imaginations across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to recognize and assist others who are vulnerable, in some cases, acutely, and, over time, advance justice. As a practice, solidarity involves two core 'enacted commitments'. The first commitment is to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need, or what I will describe below as solidaristic recognition. The second commitment is to responsive action. This hybrid definition draws upon the inspirational work of Iris Marion Young, Carol Gould, Fuyuki Kurasawa, and Prainsack and Buyx, all of whom build upon a long and rich history of interpretations of solidarity. Recognizing the suffering of the displaced and others who are 'implaced' in conditions unable to sustain them follows from the most minimal appreciation of people as ecological subjects, relational creatures who are densely enmeshed in social relations as well as spatial locations. While my analysis differs substantially, to describe this here I use Carol Gould's term, 'solidaristic recognition'. Gould distinguishes between what she calls 'rigorous recognition' and 'generous recognition'. Rigorous recognition appreciates the equality of all people through an essentially cognitive process involving an acknowledgment of our fellow humanity. The generous genre, which she recasts as 'solidaristic recognition', involves empathy, or an affective link with others, and focuses on our 'mutual interdependence and common needs'. Solidaristic recognition conceives of others as 'equal in their difference', that is, their distinctive social group membership and individual particularity. On my own interpretation, solidaristic recognition has two varieties, neither of which relies on empathy: basic and relational, responsible recognition. If we conceive of people in ecological terms, basic recognition (similar to Gould's 'rigorous recognition') might be expanded beyond its appreciation of everyone's equal moral worth to take account of the significance of place for the equitable flourishing of all ecological subjects. This most basic form of recognition acknowledges that we are equal in part because we all share a need to be 'in place' in settings that can sustain us and support our capacities. A second, more ethically responsible, form of recognition I will call relational solidaristic recognition emerges from reckoning more thoroughly with our radically relational nature as ecological subjects. This reckoning demands that we conceive of ourselves and others as embedded but also that we understand that we are constitutive of one another and our environs. Geographers have described this in terms of the intersubjectivity of identity and place. In her philosophical account of ecological subjectivity, Lorraine Code underscores the idea that we are 'made by and making [our] relations in [asymmetrical] reciprocity with other subjects and with horizontal ellipsis multiple, diverse locations'. Seeing not just identities, but also, critically, place in relational terms, highlights 'the variety of interactions between people who are located differently that go into making places'. As Iris Young puts it, we 'dwell together' in 'complex, causal' relations of interdependence and in specific atmospheric and material conditions on earth in geographic regions and neighborhoods, in homes, and institutions of care and employment. We ecological subjects, then, contribute to the construction of place - often unintentionally - through actions and interactions within a larger context of social structures and processes. These structures and processes serve to enable some people in the realization of their capacities, yet constrain others, creating and/or sustaining structural injustice. This is evidenced, for example, in urban planning policies that spawn residential segregation or global economic and trade policies that compel health care workers to migrate and deepen health inequities in source countries. While basic solidaristic recognition can allow for or has the potential to generate ethical place-making, relational recognition understands the ways that our own subjectivities, identities, and places of dwelling as ecological subjects are formed in relation to other identities in other places and, crucially, that this generates responsibilities for justice. It is in this sense that relational solidaristic recognition is a more responsible form: it appreciates better-situated ecological subjects' contributions to the injustice suffered by the displaced or precariously placed, and aspires to respond and work toward promoting justice. Responsiveness , an important epistemic and, in turn, ethical capacity, is a crucial element for enactments of solidarity in the view I want to develop. Both Joan Tronto and Elise Springer assign 'responsiveness' a prominent place in their work. Springer situates 'responsiveness' within virtue ethics. On her view, it involves a kind of adaptability, particularly in unfamiliar moral terrain, or in the face of concerns that 'resist clear representation'. Springer posits responsiveness as also involving a commitment to 'extend a temporally continuous thread of attention' or giving one's moral attention over time, not episodically or reactively. Tronto identifies responsiveness as one of four ethical elements of care, casting it as a moral capacity that involves vigilance 'to the possibilities for abuse that arise with vulnerability'. I would add another element as integral to responsiveness, drawn specifically from ecological epistemology: an ability to show finely tuned sensitivity to context, that is, the particularity of people and circumstance, and give attention and action that is fitting. Solidarity, enacted, should emerge from a disposition committed to responsiveness understood in terms of these capacities, if it is to meet the mark. In the next section I turn to responsive action that arises from solidaristic recognition, in particular, efforts at place-making for the displaced. Innovation, inspired by ecological thinking and increasingly evidence-based, is underway. 'Place-making' is a set of intentional practices spanning different disciplines that targets neighborhoods, parks and paths, features of landscape, housing developments, streetscapes, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. With and without attention to health, it is either referenced explicitly or somehow central to key international documents and declarations including the Sustainable Development Goals and UN Habitat's New Urban Agenda. It is on the agendas of the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), even the World Bank, some think tanks and foundations, and a major US corporation. Public health leaders point to place-based interventions as 'the new frontier'. In other work I have interpreted ethical place-making, a notion that first surfaced in the geography literature, as a core component of an enabling, capabilities-oriented conception of justice. Grounded in ecological thinking and an ecological conception of persons, ethical place-making understands all people as embedded socially and spatially, and often enmeshed in relationships of structural injustice that threaten health. Key elements of ethical place-making include: nurturing relations of care and interdependence; protecting bodily integrity; supporting autonomy, not interpreted in terms of individual self-reliance, but in the relational sense that sees us as originating, persisting, and flourishing within relations of care and interdependence, given ongoing opportunities for self-directed thought and action; promoting stability and a sense of rootedness and, at the same time, supporting generative movement; and finally, where necessary, responding to inequities. Below I offer selected examples of place-making drawn from a range of domains pertinent to bioethics. After describing them, I explain why they count as instances of ethical place-making inspired by (and potentially generating more) solidaristic recognition and how they stand to promote - especially health - justice and in some cases address health inequities. I start at the level of community and public health with an urban planning example, and from there, turn to a clinical and then a long-term care setting. These three case studies come from the global north. The final examples explore (mostly health-centered) place-making efforts in refugee reception and resettlement, sketching innovations in Germany and also Lebanon, a country that borders the war in Syria and ranks fourth worldwide as a host to refugees. Further research will yield additional instances of solidarity and place-making, particularly for health, in other parts of the world. In [a] system of the city as weaving, [creating] crosswise threads enables solidarity, and fundamental to solidarity is the free system of movement horizontal ellipsis 'Intentional shrinkage', 'sorting', and 'serial displacement' are terms given to the urban land use and 'development' policies that systematically shredded the social and material fabric in and around African American neighborhoods in New York City. Public health researchers have linked these policies and the consequent displacement of families, businesses, churches and more, to the AIDS epidemic, addiction, asthma, post-traumatic stress, and obesity. Working together, citizens, planners, and researchers responded with the Giraffe Path (GP), a 6-mile trail from Central Park to the Cloisters. The walking and biking path is a project emerging explicitly from the kind of solidarity described above: the recognition of the city and its people as ecologically embedded, with enduring health inequities as a result of displacements, and responsive action in the form of (re)creating place with and for ecological subjects. The GP is based on a conception of the city and its neighborhoods and residents as interdependent - and is designed to restore connections between formerly fractured communities around and across the Harlem River and, at the same time, to support outdoor physical activity. The closure of the bridge, that had long linked neighbors, as a 'crime-prevention' measure for gentrifying neighborhoods, severed (in a pattern repeated in cities everywhere) relationships between people according to categories of class and race. By (re)connecting places and people and mending - as its designers say, 'weaving', 're-stitching' - the GP helps restore these and cultivate new relations. At the same time, as part of the City Life Is Moving Bodies (CLIMB) Project, the GP's creation of flow and unimpeded movement is being celebrated as 'a victory for the city's entire circulatory system'. The attention paid to (solidaristic recognition of) the importance of place for health and most significantly, health inequities, in this instance of ethical place-making is an exception and not the norm. Urban renewal policies and planning tend to prioritize physical, economic, and social issues, yet few focus explicitly on health or show concern for health equity. Another essential dimension for future solidarity is the potential for political engagement generated by the GP. As Iris Young argues (and the inset quote implies), segregation obscures from the affluent an appreciation of their privilege, and, by limiting interaction, constrains political communication. This erodes the potential for solidarity and perpetuates social injustice. The GP designers aspire to promote solidaristic recognition through facilitating new interactions, forging new relations, and evolving as ecological subjects. We must pay attention to the lived spatial significance of patients' experience of health and illness if we are going to treat them fully and well. Doing so is one step of paying attention to a person horizontal ellipsis The terrain and overall ambience of the clinical setting is famously hostile to non-medical people, notably the ones it exists to serve. Place-centered innovation in hospitals and other centers of care is a growing niche, recognizing the harms done to ecological subjects - here patients and their families - in the 'care' of institutions built as medical assembly lines organized around time until discharge or demise. One neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, U.K., recognizes the importance of place for the health and well-being of vulnerable ecological subjects and puts into practice a concept known as 'secure base', which wraps around patients and families 'like a hug'. The unit's design also demonstrates solidarity with them in recognizing the effects of typical clinical settings and, in contrast, boasts lots of natural light, greatly reduced noise, private nooks, and a horseshoe-shape design that reflects the progression a newborn will take from intensive care to a neonatal room. In this case of ethical place-making, innovators aim to create a habitat that nurtures overlapping relations of care wherein babies sleep longer, and parents are perhaps a little less distressed, and more able to participate in care and interact with clinical care providers. As noted above, the structure of this temporary dwelling enables families to better understand, through their embodied experience, the clinical pathway the infants will follow until discharge, which in turn likely gives a boost to their sense of agency and empowerment and helps to level the playing field with clinicians. Designed by a long-term care nurse in response to her observations and experience of existing institutions, Hogeway Village accommodates elderly people with dementia in a setting meant to resemble a real European neighborhood. It has a market, cafe, salon, theater, sidewalks, and ample green space. Different models, tailored to appeal to specific social and cultural groups, are available. Staff engage with residents without clinical garb and simultaneously provide skilled care. Family members are integrally involved in care plans. Hogeway is built to protect yet not restrict, allowing residents a wide range of movement and access to the outdoors. The availability of palliative care ensures that residents do not have to relocate at the end of life, which allows for continuity of care and relationships. Another benefit is that family members need not navigate new terrains, or settings, of care or transportation as elders' needs evolve. Emerging research on long-term care settings designed more like homes and communities suggests that residents are more socially engaged and active, and experience better overall 'well-being'. Preliminary evidence also suggests that integrating families in care can improve relations with care workers, as well as resident care and health. European cities and regions have demonstrated their horizontal ellipsis willingness to express solidarity with horizontal ellipsis the world's refugees via participation in resettlement. Solidarity is at the moral center of humanitarian action, and place-making by other names has long been integral to humanitarian operations. From an emphasis on emergency and temporary assistance, humanitarians have expanded the scope and practice of 'solidarity' given the nature of current conflicts and the creation of dependencies that may lead to more sustained commitments. Their work now increasingly overlaps with development efforts to bolster host countries' capacities to receive, resettle, and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long term. Solidarity, indeed, is the basis of commitments to refugee resettlement in international humanitarian law. In 2004, the Mexico Plan of Action to Strengthen International Protection of Refugees in Latin America (MPA), which encompassed regional responsibility sharing, the expansion of resettlement space, reception capacity, and long-term integration, highlighted solidarity as a guiding principle for support of refugees from Columbia and their host countries. Northern Europe has been the preferred destination for refugees from Syria and other places where war has driven people from their homes. Germany, especially its cities, hosts more recent asylum-seekers than any other EU nation. Urban areas have absorbed two-thirds of the world's refugees and now face the work of integration. The region offers myriad examples of efforts in ethical place-making spawned by solidaristic recognition. In both Hamburg and Berlin, organizing around place has been a key strategy in welcoming and helping to integrate new arrivals. In Berlin, city planners have employed a strategy of creating container villages to help refugees feel secure and foster a sense of embeddedness-in-community. While formalized, state-administered efforts have unfolded, citizen volunteers have designed innovative responses to link refugees with needed services, helping to integrate them and provide a sense of place. The coordinated state and civil society effort, in particular, is an inspiring example of politically and socially constructed solidarity, supported and advanced by what Christine Straehle calls a 'cosmopolitan avant-garde' of citizens. Hamburg is also innovative in linking services across sectors like food, shelter, education, work skills, and legal advice, appreciating the importance of integrating services for those who have endured profound dispersion and fragmentation. The city addressed housing needs by redesigning existing buildings and engaged local communities in deciding on locations in order to help ensure a welcoming, safe environment and avoid the possibility of local neighborhood resistance. The countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey that serve as the principal hosts to refugees fleeing Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, are organizing around so-called 'resilience' strategies, which aim at bolstering host countries' capacities to accept and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long-term. This management philosophy deserves more sustained discussion. I highlight here another civil society initiative involving ethical place-making. In Lebanon during the war (1975-1990) public spaces were among the most dangerous places. Now they serve as temporary shelter areas for migrants and refugees displaced from neighboring conflict who face fear, discrimination, and violence in their new environs. In this context, one architect saw an opportunity: 'I thought by promoting place-making in Lebanon we can join the efforts of local [civil society] actors, since horizontal ellipsis place-making is based on networking and bringing people together.' With his guidance, youth in Beirut participated in identifying and recreating public spaces with the aims of reducing violence, promoting inclusion, interaction, and community-building. Along with place-making for the sake of social integration, place-based interventions in healthcare services are surfacing in response to contemporary migration patterns. Adapting to the mobility of many displaced people who are, not accessing services in camps, for instance, humanitarian and local actors have reorganized healthcare delivery. The Blue Dot Hubs developed by UNHCR and partners to provide care and services to people en route are a specific example of a response - a place-making intervention to 'changing therapeutic geographies' in modern crises. In the context of resettlement, interventions focused on the creation of 'therapeutic landscapes' aim specifically at displaced children as they resettle in new countries. Through recultivating cultural traditions, building social networks, and creating safe places, young people can create new homes. These examples depict different modes of displacement and distinct populations situated in specific kinds of settings and in particular - yet in all cases asymmetrical - relations of power. In each case, responsive action, keenly sensitive to context, emerges from solidaristic recognition, either basic or relational. In some cases it aims explicitly at justice. We can see specific elements of solidarity-sparked ethical place-making across cases. Support for relations of care is at the heart of the efforts made in the Bath NICU and Hogeway Village designs, and also in the GP and initiatives for refugees. Attention to the need for rootedness and movement is manifested in these civil society efforts to welcome and create material, social, economic, and political space for refugees; it is also an organizing principle for the GP, Hogeway, and Bath's NICU. Transformative autonomy is evident in the GP, the therapeutic landscape projects, Hogeway, and the NICU. Attention to inequities, especially health inequities, motivates the GP and Blue Dot Hubs. In all, the creators - architects, designers, planners, carers, and citizens - recognize the 'users', let us say 'dwellers', as ecological subjects and respond with concerned attention to their distinctive needs, in real time and over time with the aim of supporting their capabilities, chiefly to be healthy, and in some cases to remedy injustice. I have argued that recognizing all people as ecological subjects enables us, indeed compels us, to forge relations of solidarity and promote justice through ethical place-making with those who are vulnerable through their insecure relationship to place. On the moral landscape(s) of bioethics, an ethic of place-making expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity along with advancing health, social, and global justice with patients and families, elderly people transitioning to long-term care, urban populations confronting health inequities, asylum-seekers dwelling in precarious conditions, and perhaps others.

INTRODUCTION PLACE AND HEALTH: ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTS ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTIVITY AND SOLIDARITY Solidaristic recognition Responsiveness SOLIDARITY (AND HEALTH JUSTICE) ENACTED: ETHICAL PLACE-MAKING Community and public health Care settings Refugee assistance and integration The elements of ethical place-making CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes Drawing on a conception of people as 'ecological subjects', creatures situated in specific social relations, locations, and material environments, I want to emphasize the importance of place and place-making for basing, demonstrating, and forging future solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it here, involves reaching out through moral imagination and responsive action across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to assist other people who are vulnerable, and to advance justice. Contained in the practice of solidarity are two core 'enacted commitments', first, to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need and, second, to responsive action. Recognizing the suffering of displacement and responding through place-making should follow from even the most simplistic understanding of people as 'implaced'. Recognition, furthermore, that places are created and sustained, transformed, or neglected in ways that foster or perpetuate inequities, including health inequities, generates responsibilities concerning place-making. Place-based interventions, on either count, should be principal and, indeed, prioritized ways of showing solidarity for the vulnerable and promoting justice. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, place-making can catalyze and nurture them, and over time advance justice. On the moral landscapes of bioethics, the terrain where care and health are or should be at the center of attention, an ethic of place and place-making for those who have been displaced - patients, the elderly, urban populations, and asylum-seekers, for instance - expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity.";"displacement; justice; migrants; migration; place-making; refugees; solidarity; HEALTH; CARE; PLACEMAKING; REFUGEES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

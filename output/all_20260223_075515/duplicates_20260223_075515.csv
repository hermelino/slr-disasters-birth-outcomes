In contrast, there has been no clear evidence for radiation-induced germ cell mutations in humans that lead to birth defects, chromosome aberrations, Mendelian disorders, etc. This situation exists partly because no sensitive and practical genetic marker is available for human studies and also because the number of people exposed to large doses of radiation and subsequently having offspring was small until childhood cancer survivors became an important study population. In addition, the genome of apparently normal individuals seems to contain large numbers of alterations, including dozens to hundreds of nonfunctional alleles. With the number of mutational events in protein-coding genes estimated as less than one per genome after 1 gray (Gy) exposure, it is unsurprising that genetic effects from radiation have not yet been detected conclusively in humans. © 2013 by Annual Reviews.

However, these studies cannot elucidate the relative effects of the objective stress exposure and the subjective distress in a way that would parallel the stress experience in humans. PNMS research with humans is also limited because there are ethical challenges to designing studies that involve the random assignment of pregnant women to varying levels of independent stressors. Natural disasters present opportunities for natural experiments of the effects of pregnant women's exposure to stress on child development. In this review, we present an overview of the human and animal research on PNMS, and highlight the results of Project Ice Storm which has been following the cognitive, behavioral, motor and physical development of children exposed in utero to the January 1998 Quebec Ice Storm. We have found that both objective degree of exposure to the storm and the mothers' subjective distress have strong and persistent effects on child development, and that these effects are often moderated by the timing of the ice storm in pregnancy and by the child's sex. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.";"Disaster research; Newborn and child outcomes; Prenatal maternal stress; corticosteroid; corticotropin; hydrocortisone; asthma; autism; behavior disorder; birth weight; body mass; brain development; child development; child health; cognitive development; first trimester pregnancy; gestational age; human; hypertension; immunity; Impact of Events Scale; insulin metabolism; insulin resistance; intelligence test; intrauterine growth retardation; language ability; language development; low birth weight; maternal stress; mental disease; motoneuron; natural disaster; nerve cell differentiation; obesity; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; prenatal exposure; prenatal maternal stress; prenatal stress; priority journal; review; risk factor; second trimester pregnancy; social status; temperament; disaster research; newborn and child outcomes; Body Mass Index; Child; Child Development; Child Welfare; Cognition; Disasters; Female; Humans; Male; Obesity; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Quebec; Stress, Physiological";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84873834921&doi=10.1002%2Fbdrc.21026&partnerID=40&md5=80fd054f693164da68c807e81e0a0505"

Methods: Between January 2010 and December 2010, 874 women gave birth in L'Aquila. The women living outside of L'Aquila were excluded from the study. The remaining women, namely a sample of 451 individuals, were administered a questionnaire that focused on the level of stress experienced during the earthquake, and subsequently the Brief Cope. Results: After the earthquake there was a +22.64% increase in the number of women who desired a pregnancy. The results of the Brief Cope show that the coping strategies used by the women in L'Aquila were active coping, planning, acceptance and positive reframing. Conclusions: The desire for motherhood was the main reason accounting for the increase in births that occurred after the earthquake.

Women were interviewed regarding their hurricane experience, perceived stress, and mental health outcomes. Coping styles was assessed using the Brief COPE, PTSD symptoms using the Post-Traumatic Checklist, and depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Depression Scale. Multivariable regression models were run to determine the effects of coping styles on mental health and the interactions among coping styles, hurricane experience, and perceived stress on mental health. Apart from the positive reframing and humor coping styles, all coping styles correlated positively with PTSD or depression (p < 0.05). The instrumental support, denial, venting, and behavioral disengagement coping styles were significantly associated with worsened PTSD symptoms among those who reported higher perceived stress (p < 0.05). Use of a humor coping style seemed to reduce the effect of perceived stress on depressive symptoms (p = 0.02 for interaction) while use of instrumental support (p = 0.04) and behavioral disengagement (p < 0.01) were both associated with more symptoms of depression among those who perceived more stress.

It has also been proposed that stress exposure reduces the ratio of male-to-female births. To date, no study has jointly examined both outcomes, although they may be strongly related. Using population-level data with no selectivity, we jointly study the sex-specific effect of stress on the duration of pregnancy and the observed sex ratio among pregnant women exposed to a major earthquake in Chile. METHODS: In a quasi-experimental design, women exposed to the earthquake in different months of gestation were compared with women pregnant 1 year earlier. Estimates from a comparison group of pregnant women living in areas not affected by the earthquake were also examined to rule out confounding trends. Regression models were used to measure the impact of earthquake exposure on gestational age and preterm birth by sex across month of gestation. A counterfactual simulation was implemented to assess the effect of the earthquake on the secondary sex ratio accounting for the differential impact of stress on gestational age by sex. RESULTS: Earthquake exposure in Months 2 and 3 of gestation resulted in a significant decline in gestational age and increase in preterm delivery. Effects varied by sex, and were much larger for female than male pregnancies. Among females, the probability of preterm birth increased by 0.038 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.005, 0.072] in Month 2 and by 0.039 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.075) in Month 3. Comparable increases for males were insignificant at the conventional P < 0.05 level. After accounting for the sex-specific impact on gestational age, a decline in the male-to-female ratio in Month 3 of exposure was detected [-0.058 (95% CI: -0.113, -0.003)]. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal exposure to an exogenous stressor early but not late in the pregnancy affects gestational age and the probability of preterm birth. This effect is much stronger in females than males. Stress exposure in early pregnancy may also contribute to a decline in the ratio of male-to-female live births in exposed cohorts. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.

Results: Eight children with high objective PNMS exposure (14.5%) were obese compared to one child (1.8%) with low exposure (P = 0.02). Objective PNMS increased obesity risk (model 1, P = 0.02, odds ratio = 1.37) after controlling for other potential risk factors. Discussion: Results suggest that PNMS might be an independent risk factor in the development of childhood obesity.Methods:Participants included 111 women who were pregnant during the January 1998 Québec Ice Storm or who conceived within the following 3 months and their children. We tested associations between objective and subjective PNMS from the storm and childhood obesity status at age 5, controlling for childrens birth characteristics and breastfeeding status; household socioeconomic status; maternal obstetric complications, life events and smoking during pregnancy, psychological functioning, and height (model 1, n = 111) or BMI (for a subset of 69 participants, model 2).";"article; body mass; breast feeding; child; childhood disease; female; high risk patient; human; life event; male; maternal smoking; maternal stress; natural disaster; obesity; prenatal exposure; preschool child; priority journal; psychological aspect; risk factor; social status; Birth Weight; Child, Preschool; Disasters; Female; Humans; Male; Obesity; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Risk Factors";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-83655182987&doi=10.1038%2Fpr.2011.18&partnerID=40&md5=692bb1063c20faa97439bfb63784fb4f"

Physical examinations, a full range of clinical laboratory and imaging tests, as well as cytogenetic analyses were conducted to evaluate Fang's current health conditions. Fang shows the appearance of premature ageing and has a decreased menstrual period. Laboratory studies and imaging tests suggest nodular goitre disease and osteoporosis. Otherwise, no apparent abnormalities were found in the major organs. No malignant tumours were detected by either tumour markers or imaging tests.

Objectives: Our goal was to determine how timing and severity of exposure during pregnancy to objective and subjective stress due to a natural disaster influenced gestation length and fetal growth patterns. Methods: We assessed objective and subjective PNMS levels among 172 women exposed to an ice storm during or shortly before pregnancy. We analyzed associations between PNMS levels and outcomes (gestation length, birth weight, birth length, head circumference, and growth ratios), controlling for other variables such as age, obstetric complications, socioeconomic status, and trait anxiety. Results: Gestation lengths and predicted birth weights were shorter among participants exposed to the ice storm during early to mid pregnancy, compared to 3. rd trimester and pre-pregnancy exposure. Birth lengths were shorter in the sample compared to population references, and predicted values were shorter among participants with a ""discrepancy"" between their objective and subjective PNMS levels. High objective PNMS levels predicted smaller head circumferences in early pregnancy, but we also observed patterns in predicted values of head circumference to birth length ratios suggesting the sparing of brain development relative to birth length among boys in early pregnancy. These sparing effects decreased in later pregnancy. Conclusions: Exposure to stressful events during pregnancy influences birth outcomes independently of other factors.

Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2005, resulted in an acute crisis that temporarily disrupted the infrastructure necessary to deliver cleft care; chronic turmoil in the West Bank/Palestine has resulted in an absence of infrastructure to deliver cleft care.

Details on the specific cause of mortality can be useful for improving preventive policies. Infants are often identified as a population that is vulnerable to extreme heat conditions; however, information on heat and infant mortality is scarce, with no studies reporting on cause-specific mortality. Methods: The study includes all deaths in the Catalonia region of Spain during the warm seasons of 1983-2006 (503,389 deaths). We used the case-crossover design to evaluate the association between the occurrence of extremely hot days (days with maximum temperature above the 95th percentile) and mortality. Total mortality and infant mortality were stratified into 66 and 8 causes of death, respectively. Results: Three consecutive hot days increased total daily mortality by 19%. We calculated that 1.6% of all deaths were attributable to heat. About 40% of attributable deaths did not occur during heat-wave periods. The causes of death that were increased included cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, mental and nervous system disorders, infectious and digestive system diseases, diabetes, and some external causes such as suicide. In infants, the effect of heat was observed on the same day and was detected only for conditions originating in the perinatal period (relative risk = 1.53 [95% confidence interval = 1.16-2.02]). Within the perinatal causes, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive system, and hemorrhagic and hematologic disorders were the causes of death with stronger effects. Conclusions: Heat contributes to an increase in mortality from several causes.

Pregnant woman can tolerate a larger amount of blood loss than non-pregnant woman, but obstetric hemorrhage is characterized by a high incidence of coagulopathy. The Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists and four related academic societies published ""Guidelines for management of critical bleeding in obstetrics"" in April 2010. The following points are emphasized in these guidelines. Firstly, the trend of the shock index (heart rate/systolic blood pressure) is useful to evaluate the necessity for blood transfusion. Secondly, coagulopathy should be evaluated in a timely manner and treated promptly, when blood loss including amniotic fluid exceeds 2,000 ml. Thirdly, an urgency code for hemorrhage should be introduced to facilitate communication among the related personnel with communication between the delivery/operating room and blood transfusion service. According to a triage tag in disaster medicine, code I or code red is an extreme emergency : overt hemorrhagic shock or evident massive hemorrhage. If code I is declared by the designated commander, transfusion of uncross-matched ABO-identical as well as ABO-compatible, non-identical red blood cells should be considered, if time is short or ABO-identical red blood cells are unavailable. The commander is selected from senior physicians of the anesthesiology or the obstetric department, and is responsible for crisis management. The major problems in crisis management are hesitation to declare an emergency and failure of communication. Declaration of an emergency is also essential for calling supportive medical personnel. To deal rapidly with critical bleeding, hospital actions to be taken should be prepared, and simulation exercise should be performed to correct inappropriate actions prior to an actual crisis.

The empirical literature on the effects of disaster on pregnancy and the postpartum period is limited. The objective of this review was to examine the existing evidence on the effect of disasters on perinatal health. Methods. A systematic review was conducted by searching electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cinahl, PsycInfo), including literature on disasters and pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital anomalies), mental health, and child development. A total of 110 articles were identified, but many published reports were anecdotes or recommendations rather than systematic studies. The final review included 49 peer-reviewed studies that met inclusion criteria. Results. Studies addressing the World Trade Center disaster of September 11 and other terrorist attacks, environmental/chemical disasters, and natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes were identified. Disasters of various types may reduce fetal growth in some women, although there does not appear to be an effect on gestational age at birth. Severity of exposure is the major predictor of mental health issues among pregnant and postpartum women. After a disaster, mental health of the mother may more strongly influence on child development than any direct effect of disaster-related prenatal stress. Conclusions. There is evidence that disaster impacts maternal mental health and some perinatal health outcomes, particular among highly exposed women. Future research should focus on understudied outcomes such as spontaneous abortion. Relief workers and clinicians should concentrate on the most exposed women, particularly with respect to mental health. Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists Learning Objectives: After completion of this educational activity, the obstetrician/gynecologist should be better able to compare and contrast the effects of different types of disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, chemical spills) on pregnant and postpartum women in order to prepare for patient care in the aftermath of such disasters; differentiate the birth outcomes likely to be affected by disaster, in order to identify patients likely to be at high risk; and assess the extent to which pregnant and postpartum women are a uniquely vulnerable population after disaster, to assist in organizing care under such circumstances.

Second, resident births are analyzed in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, before, during, and after Hurricane Andrew. Third, resident births are analyzed in all Florida locales with 100,000 or more persons, comparing exposed and unexposed gravid females. Fourth, resident births are analyzed along Hurricane Andrew's path from southern Florida to northeast Mississippi. Results show that fetal distress risk increases significantly with maternal exposure to Hurricane Andrew in second and third trimesters, adjusting for known risk factors.

Logistic models were used to adjust for covariates. Results: After adjustment, rates of LBW rose for the state, but preterm birth did not. In region 1 and Orleans Parish, rates of LBW and PTB remained constant or fell. These patterns were all strongest in African American women. Rates of cesarean section and inadequate prenatal care rose. Racial disparities in birth outcomes remained constant or were reduced.

Monitoring after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine suggested that chronic low-dose radiation exposure was not linked to cancer mortality among the general population. However, elevated rates of birth defects in contaminated compared to uncontaminated regions suggest that exposure to radiation in utero might impact development and that chronic radiation exposure might represent an underestimated risk to human health. Methods: We sought to determine current radiation exposure routes in Rivne-Polissia, a region of Ukraine contaminated by the Chernobyl accident. This represents a first step toward comprehensive studies of the effects of chronic radiation exposure on human health. We designed and administered a dietary and activity survey to 344 women in Polissia. We assessed types and sources of food consumed, types of outdoor activities, and alcohol intake. Results: Alcohol intake was low and alone does not account for the observed high rates of birth defects. Wild foods, especially mushrooms and berries, and locally produced foods, especially milk related, were major radiation exposure routes. Additionally, women were exposed to radiation through inhalation while burning grasses and potato vines in fields, and wood for cooking and heating. Conclusions:Twenty four years after the Chernobyl accident, women continue to be chronically exposed to low-dose radiation at levels exceeding current recommendations. This might contribute (especially synergistically with alcohol consumption and micronutrient deficiencies) to higher prevalence of birth defects in areas of Ukraine with high levels of radiation contamination compared to uncontaminated areas. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.";"cesium; fossil fuel; adult; article; beverage; Chernobyl accident; congenital malformation; drinking behavior; eating; environmental exposure; exposure; feeding behavior; female; food; health survey; human; occupation; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; questionnaire; radioactive contamination; soil pollutant; statistics; Ukraine; water pollutant; wood; Abnormalities, Radiation-Induced; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Beverages; Cesium Radioisotopes; Chernobyl Nuclear Accident; Eating; Environmental Exposure; Female; Food; Food Contamination, Radioactive; Food Habits; Fossil Fuels; Health Surveys; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Occupations; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Questionnaires; Soil Pollutants, Radioactive; Water Pollutants, Radioactive; Wood; Basidiomycota; Poaceae; Solanum tuberosum";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77957275558&doi=10.1002%2Fajhb.21063&partnerID=40&md5=d15bf8a29fafe14ae17f4c1fd5764427"

The accident destroyed one of the RBMK-1000 type reactors and released significant radioactive contamination into the environment. At first the emissions were transported north-westwards over Poland, the Baltic States, Finland, Sweden and Norway. During 27 April 1986 emissions were spreading to eastern-central Europe, southern Germany, Italy and Yugoslavia. Radioactivity mapping over Finland between 29 April and 16 May 1986 showed that the ground deposition in Finland covered southern and central parts of the country but had an irregular distribution. The highest (over 100 μR h-1 [1 μSv h-1]) contamination disclosed by the mapping was around the city of Uusikaupunki in western Finland and the city of Kotka in southeastern Finland. The Uusikaupunki region was an area of heavy fallout associated with the air mass that was located in the Chernobyl area at the time of the accident. The fallout pattern of reftractory nuclides, e.g. plutonium isotopes, had their spatial maximum in this region. Medical consequences in Finland were luckily mild, the most important symptoms being psychological ones. No increase in thyroid cancer or birth defect occurrence has been observed. The Chernobyl accident boosted the radioecological research which had already been calming down after the last atmospheric nuclear test in China in October 1980. Important new results concerning e.g. hot particles have been achieved. The most important effects of the accident in Finland were, however, the increase of public awareness of environmental issues in general and especially of nuclear energy.

Every rapid triage protocol has inherent, significant limitations: (1) no mechanism of injury (MOI) considerations; (2) limited assessment points; and (3) no refinement in truly mass-casualty situations where transport of ""minor"" or ""moderate"" patients may be delayed.Hypothesis: When rapid initial triage protocols are utilized, a significant triage deficiency (""under-triage"") may occur when ""minor"" or ""moderate"" casualties actually are more severely injured than initially triaged. Some MOI produce casualties with subtle or latent (i.e., hidden or delayed) signs and symptoms not considered in the commonly used prehospital triage algorithms. This research did not focus on START or other initial triage screening methods. Instead, it focuses on developing follow-on triage guidance to more specifically prioritize ""delayed transport"" casualties based upon signs and symptoms related to their MOI.Methods: Using expert opinion and accepted clinical criteria, triage algorithms were developed to re-evaluate patients triaged to ""minor"" and ""moderate"" cohorts. A detailed literature search produced a draft list of relevant signs and symptoms for each selected MOI. The lists then were evaluated by a multi-disciplinary panel of experts via an anonymous, mail-based Delphi method. The input shaped triage algorithms for each selected MOI, which then were subjected to a second stage Delphi process.Results: Consensus was achieved using the Delphi method. The algorithms extend patient assessment beyond the rapid initial triage protocols and incorporate triage criteria specific to each selected injury mechanism or condition: (1) penetrating injuries; (2) unconventional MOI (burns, blast, chemical, radiation); (3) smoke and other inhalation exposure; and (4) injuries with concomitant pregnancy. The full list of triage protocols is designated by the acronym ""-PLUS"".Conclusions: ""-PLUS"" Prehospital Casualty Triage may supplement the strengths of already existing, widely accepted mass-casualty triage strategies. It does not displace START or other rapid initial triage protocols, but in mass-casualty situations with extensive delays in transport, it provides a method to identify under-triage of seriously injured casualties. ""-PLUS"" also presents a framework for capturing the triage considerations used by experienced medical providers, and so may provide a valuable teaching tool for training future triage professionals.

Others report benefits after traumatic experiences (posttraumatic growth). The objective of this study was to examine demographic and hurricane-related predictors of resilience and posttraumatic growth. Methods: We interviewed 222 pregnant southern Louisiana women and 292 postpartum women completed interviews at delivery and 8 weeks later. Resilience was measured by scores lower than a nonaffected population, using the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist. Posttraumatic growth was measured by questions about perceived benefits of the storm. Women were asked about their experience of the hurricane, addressing danger, illness/injury, and damage. Chi-square tests and log-Poisson models were used to calculate associations and relative risks for demographics, hurricane experience, and mental health resilience and perceived benefit. Findings: Thirty-five percent of pregnant and 34% of the postpartum women were resilient from depression, whereas 56% and 49% were resilient from posttraumatic stress disorder. Resilience was most likely among White women, older women, and women who had a partner. A greater experience of the storm, particularly injury/illness or danger, was associated with lower resilience. Experiencing damage because of the storm was associated with increased report of some perceived benefits. Conclusion: Many pregnant and postpartum women are resilient from the mental health consequences of disaster, and perceive benefits after a traumatic experience. Certain aspects of experiencing disaster reduce resilience, but may increase perceived benefit. © 2010 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.";"adult; article; Caucasian; checklist; controlled study; demography; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; educational status; emotional stability; female; human; hurricane; income; interview; marriage; maternal behavior; mental health; Negro; normal human; parity; personal experience; posttraumatic stress disorder; prediction; pregnancy; psychological aspect; puerperium; race difference; social support; United States; Adult; Age Factors; Cyclonic Storms; Depression, Postpartum; Female; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Louisiana; Maternal Welfare; Mental Health; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prenatal Care; Resilience, Psychological; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological; Women's Health; Young Adult";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-72749126619&doi=10.1016%2Fj.whi.2009.10.002&partnerID=40&md5=19c60b7db2a9b1dced2d7ea4ad04bc4e"

After Katrina, obstetric, prenatal, and neonatal care was compromised in the short term, but increases in adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight, and maternal complications were mostly limited to highly exposed women. Both pregnant and postpartum women had rates of post-traumatic stress disorder similar to, or lower than, others exposed to Katrina, and rates of depression similar to other pregnant and postpartum populations. Health behaviors, such as smoking and breastfeeding, may have been somewhat negatively affected by the disaster, whereas effects on nutrition were likely associated with limited time, money, and food choices, and indicated by both weight gain and loss. We conclude that, with a few specific exceptions, postdisaster concerns and health outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women were similar to those of other people exposed to Hurricane Katrina. In such situations, disaster planners and researchers should focus on providing care and support for the normal concerns of the peripartum period, such as breastfeeding, depression, and smoking cessation. Contraception needs to be available for those who do not want to become pregnant.

Under-five mortality can also be assessed through a modified prior birth history method in which a representative sample of reproductive-aged women are questioned about dates of child births and deaths. Maternal mortality can be appraised via the initial identification of maternal deaths in the study population and a subsequent investigation to determine the cause of each death. © Overseas Development Institute, 2009.";"Cross-sectional surveys; Humanitarian emergencies; Mortality; household survey; humanitarian aid; mortality; surveying; altruism; article; cross-sectional study; disaster planning; emergency; human; information processing; maternal mortality; relief work; retrospective study; statistics; survival; time; statistics and numerical data; Altruism; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Collection; Disaster Planning; Emergencies; Humans; Maternal Mortality; Relief Work; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Time Factors";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70049085125&doi=10.1111%2Fj.1467-7717.2008.01085.x&partnerID=40&md5=b55583d5b26b44a6d94918cfd01ef24f"

Inherent resistance against the stress induced by the earthquake was also assessed. Methods: The panel study consisted of 99 women who provided responses before and after delivery (response rate, 77.9%). Psychological impact was assessed on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and stress resistance was assessed on the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC). Results: In adjusted multivariate models, the significant earthquake factor that predicted postnatal depression (EPDS) was 'existing anxiety about an earthquake' (β = 0.27, P = 0.01) and 'parity' (β = -0.26, P = 0.02). The SOC during pregnancy significantly moderated between 'existing anxiety about an earthquake' and 'EPDS' (β = -0.21, P = 0.02). During pregnancy the EDPS was a significant predictor of a physical abnormality during pregnancy or childbirth (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.41). The SOC during pregnancy did not moderate between a physical abnormality and earthquake-related stress. Conclusions: Provision of an adequate support system and improvement of the SOC of young women affected by a disaster may be two ways of reducing the deleterious effects of disaster-related stress on maternal well-being. © 2009 The Authors.";"Depression; Earthquake; Natural disaster; adult; anxiety; article; controlled study; delivery; earthquake; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; female; human; Japan; maternal welfare; parity; pregnant woman; puerperal depression; stress; Adult; Earthquakes; Family; Female; Health; Humans; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Questionnaires; Regression Analysis; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-58449091764&doi=10.1111%2Fj.1440-1819.2008.01911.x&partnerID=40&md5=3ba3bb3d1b2a3f16ceef5e8e9b3d0967"

This program will be described in four temporal stages; the pre-program early years (1999-2001) where the health burden is defined, leading to the Healthy Start years (2001-2005), in which spatial analyses, methods to effectively disseminate GIS results, the creation of the Baton Rouge Healthy Start database, and a move toward a conceptual goal of creating a holistic neighborhood GIS-health model are all described. The Katrina years (September 2005-early 2006) portrays the impact of the disaster and how the collaboration changed as resources from both were directed toward both response and recovery. The final section of the paper, the Post-Katrina years (early 2006 and ongoing) describes how the health landscape of Louisiana, including Baton Rouge as well as New Orleans, has worsened after the storms. An argument is made that the relationships and GIS structure developed during the collaboration's pre-Katrina years, even though stretched, provide the flexibility to analyze and cope with a Katrina-type shock to the system.

Nurses had no choice but to be creative and flexible and improvise by using what limited resources were available. Nurses were not able to provide care in the typical patient care environment because patients were relocated to multiple areas of the hospital, the ER ramp, and the parking garage to await evacuation. The temperature soared to 110°F, and evacuation efforts were chaotic and disorganized.

We studied mental health and birth outcomes among women exposed to Hurricane Katrina. Methods: We collected data prospectively from a cohort of 301 women from New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Pregnant women were interviewed during pregnancy about their experiences during the hurricane, and whether they had experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or depression. High hurricane exposure was defined as having 3 or more of the 8 severe hurricane experiences, such as feeling that ones life was in danger, walking through floodwaters, or having a loved one die. Results: The frequency of low birth weight was higher in women with high hurricane exposure (14.0%) than women without high hurricane exposure (4.7%), with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-9.89; P < 0.01. The frequency of preterm birth was higher in women with high hurricane exposure (14.0%) than women without high hurricane exposure (6.3%), with aOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 0.82-6.38; P > 0.05. There were no significant differences in the frequency of low birth weight or preterm birth between women with PTSD or depression and women without PTSD or depression (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Women who had high hurricane exposure were at an increased risk of having low birth weight infants. Rather than a general exposure to disaster, exposure to specific severe disaster events and the intensity of the disaster experience may be better predictors of poor pregnancy outcomes. To prevent poor pregnancy outcomes during and after disasters, future disaster preparedness may need to include the planning of earlier evacuation of pregnant women to minimize their exposure to severe disaster events.

Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology scores, obstetric statistics, and American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology pass rates before and after Katrina were analyzed for significant differences from year to year. Results: After Katrina, all residents were shifted to other teaching sites in the state, and the program gained 2 additional private teaching sites. The department lost 10 residents in the year following Katrina and replaced them with 5 new residents for the next academic year. There was no significant difference in Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology scores for individual residents from 2004 to 2006, and the median score for the program has not changed significantly for the past 4 years. The only number that has changed is the number of cesarean sections performed by second-year residents, which decreased significantly from 2005-2006 to 2006-2007 but has stabilized over the last year. The classes of 2004-2006 had 100% pass rates on the written American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology examination, with 1 failure in 2007. Conclusions: The Obstetrics and Gynecology program at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center provided uninterrupted training for residents through cooperation with other Louisiana State University facilities and private institutions in the state. We saw a small decrease in the number of cesarean sections performed by our second-year residents 1 year after Katrina; however, the rest of the resident experience has remained stable.

Physiological changes that mediate these effects include alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and in testosterone levels. This human study focuses on changes related to these physiological systems after prenatal stress exposure. METHODS: We examined the potential effect of prenatal stress associated with the Chernobyl disaster in an ongoing genetic epidemiological study in Finland. One birth cohort of twins (n = 121 twin pairs) was exposed in utero to maternal stress, and their saliva cortisol and testosterone levels at age 14 were compared with twins (n = 157 twin pairs) born one year later. RESULTS: Cortisol levels in both sexes and testosterone levels among females were significantly elevated after prenatal exposure to maternal stress from the second trimester onwards, compared to reference groups of non-exposed adolescents. Exposure explains 3% of variance (p<0.05) in cortisol levels and 18% of variance in testosterone levels (p<0.001). No significant differences were found for exposure from either first or third trimester onwards. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that prenatal exposure to maternal stress in the second trimester of pregnancy may have resulted in prenatal programming of physiological systems relating to cortisol and testosterone levels.";"hydrocortisone; testosterone; adolescent; article; chemistry; chernobyl accident; environmental exposure; female; Finland; human; hypophysis adrenal system; hypothalamus hypophysis system; male; mental stress; metabolism; physiology; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prenatal exposure; psychological aspect; puberty; saliva; twins; Adolescent; Chernobyl Nuclear Accident; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Male; Maternal Exposure; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Trimesters; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Puberty; Saliva; Stress, Psychological; Testosterone";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-48249122029&doi=10.1136%2Fjech.2007.060350&partnerID=40&md5=f4c40f9b9e8f103e1830babac1b949ce"

The only exception was November 1986, when the number of newborn boys was significantly reduced. This has been explained by a selective negative impact of the Chernobyl accident in April 1986 on male fetuses during the third month of their prenatal development. Objectives: The first and most radioactive cloud passed over the Czech Republic during 30 April-1 May 1986. Concurrent rainfall multiplied the radioactivity by up to > 10,000-fold in specific regions. We verified a hypothesis that the decrease in the male birth fraction in November 1986 correlated with the level of radiation in eight Czech regions after the Chernobyl disaster. Results: We found a relationship between the level of radiation and the decrease in the number of newborn boys. The number of newborn boys was decreased in the six eastern regions where the radiation was strongly increased due to rain that accompanied the radioactive cloud. In contrast, the number of newborn boys was not reduced in the two western regions where the radioactivity was markedly lower. Conclusions: A negative impact of radiation on the prenatal population was manifested as a selective loss of newborn boys in November 1986. This loss correlated with level of radioactivity. The 131I probably played the most important role because of its up-take during primary saturation of fetal thyroid by iodine, which accompanies the onset of the gland function in 3-month-old fetuses.";"Atomic power station; Birth seasonality; Ecologic catastrophe; Newborn sex ratio; Pregnancy outcome; Radiation; Radioiodine; Raining; Spontaneous abortion; thyroid hormone; article; birth rate; chernobyl accident; Czech Republic; female; geography; gestational age; human; male; metabolism; newborn; radiation; radioactive waste; season; spontaneous abortion; Abortion, Spontaneous; Birth Rate; Chernobyl Nuclear Accident; Female; Geography; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Radiation; Radioactive Fallout; Seasons; Thyroid Hormones";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38749137788&doi=10.1289%2Fehp.10779&partnerID=40&md5=ed179a625a8597347bcfd01c4c26f9c1"

The presence of these abnormalities in barn swallows is associated with reduced viability. These findings demonstrate a link between morphological abnormalities and radiation in an animal population that cannot be attributed to poverty and stress.

The Province has been a beneficiary of emergency relief programs, which have assisted >22% of the population. However, these programs were not based on sound epidemiological data, and they have not established baseline data against which to assess the impact of the programs.Objective: The objective of this study was to document mortality rates, causes of death, the prevalence of malnutrition, and the prevalence of lost pregnancies after 2.5 years of humanitarian response to the crisis.Methods: A two-stage, 30-cluster household survey was conducted in the Cahora Bassa and Changara districts from 22 October to 08 November 2004. A total of 838 households were surveyed, with a population size of 4,688 people.Results: Anthropometric data were collected among children 6-59 months of age. In addition, crude mortality rates (crude mortality rates), under five mortality rates (under 5 mortality rate), causes of deaths, and prevalence of lost pregnancies were determined among the sample population. The prevalence of malnutrition was 8.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 6.2-9.8%) for acute malnutrition, 26.9% (95% CI = 24.0-29.9%) for being underweight, and 37.0% (95% CI = 33.8-40.2%) for chronic malnutrition. Boys were more likely to be under-weight than were girls (odds ratio (OR) = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.00, 1.82;p <0.05) after controlling for a, household size, and food aid beneficiary status. Similarly, children 30-59 months of age were significantly less likely to suffer from acute malnutrition (OR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.26, 0.79; p <0.01) and less likely to be underweight (OR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.27, 0.51;p <0.01) than children 6-29 months of a, after adjusting for the other, aforementioned factors. The proportion of lost pregnancies was estimated at 7.7% (95% CI = 4.5-11.0%). A total of 215 deaths were reported during the year preceding the survey. Thirty-nine (18.1%) children <5 years of age died. The CMR was 1.23/10,000/day (95% CI = 1.08-1.38), and an under 5 mortality rate was 1.03/10,000/day (95% CI = 0.71-1.35). Diarrheal diseases, malaria, tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) accounted for more than two-thirds of all deaths.Conclusions: The observed CMR in Tete Province, Mozambique is three times higher than the baseline rate for sub-Saharan Africa and 1.4 times higher than the CMR cut-off point used to define excess mortality in emergencies.The current humanitarian response in Tete Province would benefit from an improved alignment of food aid programming in conjunction with diarrheal disease control, HIV/AIDS, and malaria prevention and treatment programs. The impact of the food programs would be improved if mutually acceptable food aid program objectives, verifiable indicators relevant to each objective, and beneficiary targets and selection criteria are developed.

Several characteristics of the Swedish data, however, raise questions regarding the external validity of the findings. We repeat the test with data from Denmark, Iceland, and England and Wales. We use time-series methods that control for trends, seasonal cycles, and other forms of autocorrelation that could confound the test. None of the results supports the ""damaged cohort"" theory. Consistent with the Swedish findings and with evolutionary theory, we find support in Iceland and England and Wales for the ""culled cohort"" theory.

Animal studies, using random assignment to experimental and control groups, demonstrate the noxious effects of prenatal maternal stress on physical, behavioural and cognitive development. The generalizability of these results to humans is problematic given that cognitive attributions moderate reactions to stressors. In humans, researchers have relied upon maternal anxiety or exposure to life events as proxies for the stressors used with animals. Yet, the associations between maternal anxiety or potentially non-independent life events and problems in infants are confounded by genetic transmission of temperament from mother to child. We summarize the literature on prenatal maternal stress and infant cognitive development, leading to the conclusion that the human literature lacks the ability to separate the effects of the objective exposure to a stressor and the mother's subjective reaction. We then describe our prospective Project Ice Storm in which we are following 150 children who were exposed in utero to a natural disaster.

Studies in humans and animals convincingly demonstrate that environmental perturbations in utero may permanently change organ structure and metabolism and/or alter homeostatic regulatory mechanisms among the offspring. These programmed changes may be the origins of adult diseases, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. Throughout evolution and development, humans and animals have been exposed to two common environmental stresses, drought and famine. Notably, drought-induced water deprivation is associated with dehydration anorexia and thus a concomitant potential nutrient stress. Our laboratory has performed studies among pregnant rat and sheep in which we simulate drought conditions via maternal dehydration and famine conditions via nutrient restriction. Maternal dehydration results in low-birth-weight offspring, which demonstrate gender-specific plasma hypernatremia and hypertonicity and arterial hypertension. Gestational nutrient restriction also resulted in low-birth-weight offspring. If permitted rapid catch-up growth by nutrient availability, these offspring demonstrate evidence of increased body weight and body fat, and leptin resistance as adults. Conversely, if the catch-up growth is delayed by nutrition restriction, the offspring exhibit normal body weight, body fat, and plasma leptin levels as adults. These studies indicate that osmoregulatory and cardiovascular homeostasis and phenotypic predisposition to obesity may be programmed in utero.

Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) scores and parent-reported language abilities of 58 toddlers of mothers who were exposed to varying levels of prenatal stress were obtained at 2 y of age. The hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that the toddlers' birth weight and age at testing accounted for 12.0% and 14.8% of the variance in the Bayley MDI scores and in productive language abilities, respectively. More importantly, the level of prenatal stress exposure accounted for an additional 11.4% and 12.1% of the variance in the toddlers' Bayley MDI and productive language abilities and uniquely accounted for 17.3% of the variance of their receptive language abilities. The more severe the level of prenatal stress exposure, the poorer the toddlers' abilities. The level of prenatal stress exposure accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in the three dependent variables above and beyond that already accounted for by non-ice storm-related factors.

These findings have led to the fetal origins hypothesis that proposes that the fetus adapts to a limited supply of nutrients, and in doing so it permanently alters its physiology and metabolism, which could increase its risk of disease in later life. The Dutch famine - though a historical disaster - provides a unique opportunity to study effects of undernutrition during gestation in humans. People who had been exposed to famine in late or mid gestation had reduced glucose tolerance. Whereas people exposed to famine in early gestation had a more atherogenic lipid profile, somewhat higher fibrinogen concentrations and reduced plasma concentrations of factor VII, a higher BMI and they appeared to have a higher risk of CHD. Though the latter was based on small numbers, as could be expected from the relatively young age of the cohort. Nevertheless, this is the first evidence in humans that maternal undernutrition during gestation is linked with the risk of CHD in later life. Our findings broadly support the hypothesis that chronic diseases originate through adaptations made by the fetus in response to undernutrition. The long-term effects of intrauterine undernutrition, however, depend upon its timing during gestation and on the tissues and systems undergoing critical periods of development at that time. Furthermore, our findings suggest that maternal malnutrition during gestation may permanently affect adult health without affecting the size of the baby at birth. This gives the fetal origins hypothesis a new dimension. It may imply that adaptations that enable the fetus to continue to grow may nevertheless have adverse consequences for health in later life. CHD may be viewed as the price paid for successful adaptations to an adverse intra-uterine environment. It also implies that the long-term consequences of improved nutrition of pregnant women will be underestimated if these are solely based on the size of the baby at birth. We need to know more about what an adequate diet for pregnant women might be. In general, women are especially receptive to advice about diet and lifestyle before and during a pregnancy.

In many cases the studies were aimed at the detection of differences of pregnancy outcome measurements between regions or time periods. Most authors conclude that there is no evidence of a detrimental physical effect on congenital anomalies or other outcomes of pregnancy following the accident. In this paper, we report on statistical analyses of time trends of perinatal mortality in Germany. Our main intention is to investigate whether perinatal mortality, as reflected in official records, was increased in 1987 as a possible effect of the Chernobyl accident. We show that, in Germany as a whole, there was a significantly elevated perinatal mortality proportion in 1987 as compared to the trend function. The increase is 4.8% (p = 0.0046) of the expected perinatal death proportion for 1987. Even more pronounced levels of 8.2% (p = 0.0458) and 8.5% (p = 0.0702) may be found in the higher contaminated areas of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), including West Berlin, and of Bavaria, respectively. To investigate the impact of statistical models on results, we applied three standard regression techniques. The observed significant increase in 1987 is independent of the statistical model used. Stillbirth proportions show essentially the same behavior as perinatal death proportions, but the results for all of Germany are nonsignificant due to the smaller numbers involved. Analysis of the association of stillbirth proportions with the 137Cs deposition on a district level in Bavaria discloses a significant relationship. Our results are in contrast to those of many analyses of the health consequences of the Chernobyl accident and contradict the present radiobiologic knowledge. As we are dealing with highly aggregated data, other causes or artifacts may explain the observed effects.

Other than SO2, we also examined the number of eruptions, the amount of ashfall, and the average level of suspended particulate matter. None of these factors was associated with neonatal mortality. Although the present study suggests that increase in SO2 levels has had an adverse effect on neonatal mortality in the neighborhood of Mt. Sakurajima, it is difficult to determine the source of the SO2. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of the excess neonatal mortality probably associated with the volcanic SO2 levels.";"sulfur dioxide; air pollutant; article; confidence interval; environmental exposure; human; infant mortality; Japan; newborn; Poisson distribution; regression analysis; risk factor; season; statistical model; statistics; volcano; Air Pollutants; Confidence Intervals; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Likelihood Functions; Poisson Distribution; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Seasons; Sulfur Dioxide; Volcanic Eruption";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033218426&doi=10.2188%2Fjea.9.344&partnerID=40&md5=0c509a159a1d5b60382c2a9e9d966fa9"

This report examines the impact of an economic embargo from 1991 to 1994 on health, well-being, and human rights in Haiti. Methods. Data from surveillance systems for nutrition, reportable diseases, and hospital diagnoses were combined with survey data and interviews with affected women, governmental representatives, diplomats, and staff of nongovernmental organizations. Results. Changes included declining income, rising unemployment, poorer nutrition, declining infant mortality, rising mortality among 1- to 4-year-olds, decreased attention to children's well-being and education, and family breakdown. Survival strategies among poor Haitians included changed dietary habits, informal-sector economic activity, moving in with relatives, selling domestic goods, increased informal unions among couples, decreased school attendance, and indentured servitude among children. Conclusions. The implementation of economic sanctions in Haiti resulted in extensive violations of rights; the impact was greatest on the most disadvantaged Haitians. Many Haitian and international supporters of democracy were unaware of the extensive negative impact that sanctions could have. The impact continues now, 5 years after sanctions ended. Modified policies reduced some of the burden of sanctions, and international assistance prevented what otherwise might have become a humanitarian disaster during sanctions.";"economic aspect; Haiti; health care; health care organization; human; human rights; malnutrition; nutrition; policy; review; unemployment; wellbeing";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032862241&doi=10.2105%2FAJPH.89.10.1499&partnerID=40&md5=f7b814a77c2f70fc5673db7610eeb615"

Numerous investigations have been carried out concerning the possible impact of the Chernobyl accident, in April 1986, on the prevalence of anomalies at birth and on perinatal mortality. The accident has contaminated Eastern Europe more heavily than Western Europe. If there was an effect of the radioactive contamination on perinatal mortality or stillbirth proportions one would expect to find it more pronounced in Eastern Europe as compared to Western Europe. We therefore studied long-term time trends in European stillbirth proportions. Methods. Linear logistic regression was applied to model the time trends in stillbirth proportions. Dummy variables were used to account for effects that can be associated with certain years or locations. A synoptic logistic regression model is suggested for the western, central, and eastern parts of Europe. Results. There is a marked differential effect in the long-term stillbirth time trends between Western Europe (Belgium, France, Great Britain, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal. Spain), Central Europe (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Norway Switzerland), and Eastern Europe represented by four countries (Greece, Hungary, Poland, Sweden). In contrast to the western and central European trends, the eastern European trend exhibits an absolute increase of the stillbirth proportion in 1986 as compared with 1985 and an apparent upward shift of the whole trend line from 1986 on. Conclusion. Our results are in contrast to those of many analyses of the health consequences of the Chernobyl accident and contradict the present radiobiological knowledge. As we are dealing with highly aggregated data, other causes or artefacts may explain the observed effects.

Information about speed and direction of winds was obtained from a local meteorologic station and an ambient air-quality monitoring trailer. Health and productivity data for surrounding beef herds, as well as exposure information, were collected and analyzed. Results - An association was not found between total herd calf mortality and herd distance from the leak wind-aided exposure, location in the river valley, signs of irritation consistent with exposure to the gas, or reports of odors of gas at the time of the leak. Management changes reported in response to the gas leak were identified as risk factors for total herd calf mortality. Other herd-level risk factors associated with increased calf mortality ratio included a median calving date in February and percentage of twin births for a herd.

Large camps settle great numbers of refugees to the hinterland of the camp and limit their access to resources available there. This may increase refugee dependency and vulnerability. There is some slight evidence from the analysis of data provided by Mercer (1992) that child mortality rates (aged 0-4 years) are positively correlated with camp size (as inferred from child populations).

Teratogenic potential of chemicals, released as a result of accidents and catastrophes, is of critical significance. Congenital Minamata disease is due to transplacental fetal toxicity caused by accidental ingestion of methyl mercury. Generalized disorders of ectodermal tissue following prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls have been reported in Taiwan and Japan. The Bhopal gas disaster; a catastrophic industrial accident, was due to a leak of toxic gas, methyl isocyanate (MIC), in the pesticide manufacturing process. The outcome of pregnancy was studied in female survivors of MIC exposure. The spontaneous abortion rate was nearly four times more common in the affected areas as compared to the control area (24.2% versus 5.6%; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, while stillbirth rate was found to be similar in the affected and control areas, the perinatal and neonatal mortality rates were observed to be higher in the affected area. The rate of congenital malformations in the affected and control areas did not show any significant difference.

Adverse reproductive outcomes include infertility, early pregnancy loss, stillbirths, congenital malformations, and serious developmental disabilities such as cerebral palsy and mental retardation. Recent disasters like the Chernobyl and Bhopal explosions have provided important lessons on the need for accurate and sound information about the risk of prenatal exposures for adverse reproductive outcomes. To study questions of adverse reproductive outcomes and disasters requires a well-planned approach.

This review fills a gap by synthesizing evidence for a clinician audience. DATA SOURCES: Systematic scoping review of articles published in PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov from January 2010 through December 2023. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Empirical studies published in English-language peer-reviewed journals, assessing associations between select climate drivers and adverse maternal and birth outcomes. The review included studies examining heat, storms, sea level rise, flooding, drought, wildfires, and other climate-related factors. Health outcomes included preterm birth, low birthweight, small for gestational age, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, miscarriage/stillbirth and maternal mortality. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: The scoping review protocol was registered with the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202410004, January 3, 2024) and conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Data were extracted by 2 authors; quality and risk of bias was assessed independently. RESULTS: Total of 966 references were screened; 16.35% (k=158) met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies (146/158; 92.4%) documented statistically significant and clinically meaningful associations between climate drivers and adverse perinatal health outcomes, including risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, and stillbirth as well as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, miscarriage, and maternal death. Among the most durable findings: extreme heat exposure in early and late pregnancy were associated with increased risk of preterm birth and stillbirth. Driven in part by large (often population-based) studies and objective outcomes from surveillance data or medical record reviews, studies in this scoping review were evaluated as high quality (scoring 7-9 on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale). Risk of bias was generally low. CONCLUSIONS: Climate drivers are consistently associated with adverse health outcomes for pregnant people. Continuing education for clinicians, and clinician-patient communications should be expanded to address risks of climate change and extreme weather exposure, especially risks of extreme heat in late-pregnancy. Results from this review should inform multilevel interventions to address adverse health effects of climate during pregnancy as well as practice advisories, protocols, checklists, and clinical guidelines in obstetrics.";"climate change; environmental health; pregnancy; maternal and child outcomes; scoping review; HIGH AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; BIRTH OUTCOMES; PRETERM BIRTH; HEAT WAVES; PLANETARY HEALTH; RISK; EXPOSURE; PREGNANCY; ASSOCIATION; IMPACT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

If oil spill-exposed women were equally prone to complications in pregnancies that occurred prior to the oil spill as after it, it was considered that any associations were likely due to selection or reporting issues. Women who reported oil spill exposure, particularly loss of use of the coast, were more likely to report gestational diabetes; however, the level of association was similar for pregnancies before and after the spill (p for interaction > 0.10 and odds ratios (ORs) for pregnancies prior to the spill > than those after the spill).

The question arises whether the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident entailed similar phenomena in Japan. For 47 prefectures representing 15.2 million births from 2001 to 2014, the Japanese government provides monthly statistics on 69,171 cases of perinatal death of the fetus or the newborn after 22 weeks of pregnancy to 7 days after birth. Employing change-point methodology for detecting alterations in longitudinal data, we analyzed time trends in perinatal mortality in the Japanese prefectures stratified by exposure to estimate and test potential increases in perinatal death proportions after Fukushima possibly associated with the earthquake, the tsunami, or the estimated radiation exposure. Areas with moderate to high levels of radiation were compared with less exposed and unaffected areas, as were highly contaminated areas hit versus untroubled by the earthquake and the tsunami. Ten months after the earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident, perinatal mortality in 6 severely contaminated prefectures jumped up from January 2012 onward: jump odds ratio 1.156; 95% confidence interval (1.061, 1.259), P-value 0.0009. There were slight increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. In severely contaminated areas, the increases of perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima were essentially independent of the numbers of dead and missing due to the earthquake and the tsunami. Perinatal mortality in areas contaminated with radioactive substances started to increase 10 months after the nuclear accident relative to the prevailing and stable secular downward trend. These results are consistent with findings in Europe after Chernobyl. Since observational studies as the one presented here may suggest but cannot prove causality because of unknown and uncontrolled factors or confounders, intensified research in various scientific disciplines is urgently needed to better qualify and quantify the association of natural and artificial environmental radiation with detrimental genetic health effects at the population level.";"change-point analysis; detrimental pregnancy outcome; ionizing radiation; nuclear accident; radiation induced genetic effect; stillbirth; CHERNOBYL REACTOR ACCIDENT; SEX-RATIO; IONIZING-RADIATION; CHILDHOOD-CANCER; X-RAYS; GERMANY; BIRTH; WOMEN; RISK; STILLBIRTH";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Exposure during pregnancy can influence birth outcomes through mechanisms related to healthcare, infrastructure disruption, stress, nutrition, and injury. However, accurate estimation of health effects may be limited by nonspecific exposure definitions that create potential misclassification. The two predominant hurricane exposure assignments are (1) the county of a FEMA presidential disaster declaration; and (2) the specified area within a storm track. The authors propose a third method: meteorological severity of wind speed. Based on the Saffir-Simpson categories, wind speed was examined through binary and quartile comparisons. All three methods of exposure classification were compared by examining the associations with county-level preterm birth and low-birth-weight rates among Florida women who were pregnant during the 2004 hurricane season. The county-level environmental quality index developed by the EPA was used to control for county-level environmental factors. Although the models yielded unexpected negative results and insignificant rate differences, a descriptive and mapping analysis of the exposure methods showed clear heterogeneity of county exposure.

Daily wildfire-specific PM2.5 at a 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees (approximate to 25 km x 25 km) resolution was estimated by a machine learning method combining 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and reanalysis meteorological data. Cox proportional hazards models were implemented to evaluate the association between wildfire-specific PM2.5 and preterm birth/term low birth weight. Number and fraction of preterm birth/term low birth weight attributable to wildfire-specific PM2.5 during pregnancy were calculated.Results: Per one interquartile-range rise in wildfire-specific PM2.5 was found to be associated with 6.9% (HR: 1.069, 95% CI: 1.058-1.081) increased risk of preterm birth and 3.6% (HR: 1.036, 95% CI: 1.014-1.058) higher risk of term low birth weight. The most susceptible gestational window was the 2nd trimester for preterm birth whereas the 1st for term low birth weight. We estimated that 14.30% preterm births and 8.04% term low birth weight cases were attributable to maternal exposure to wildfire-specific PM2.5 during the whole pregnancy. Male infants and mothers aged >= 40, experiencing temperature extremes or living in the inner region, and concepted during spring had higher risks of preterm birth/term low birth weight associated with wildfire-specific PM2.5. Comparatively, mothers with advanced age have a higher risk of preterm birth while younger mothers were more likely to deliver term newborns with low birth weight, when being exposed to wildfire-specific PM2.5. Pregnancy - induced hypertension enhanced the risk of preterm birth associated with wildfire-specific PM2.5.Conclusions: This study strengthened robust evidence on the enhanced risk of preterm birth/term low birth weight associated with maternal exposure to wildfire-specific PM2.5.

These children are compared with other children born in the same county who were not exposed to disasters while in utero. Regression results suggest that children exposed to hurricanes prenatally have lower scores on third grade standardized tests in math and reading. Those exposed to flooding or tornadoes also have somewhat lower math scores.

Floods can increase stress which may negatively impact perinatal outcomes and mental health, but previous research is inconsistent. The objectives of this study are to examine the impact of the flood on pregnancy health, birth outcomes and postpartum mental health. Methods Linked administrative data from the province of Alberta were used. Outcomes included preterm birth, small for gestational age, a new diagnoses of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, and a diagnosis of, or drug prescription for, depression or anxiety. Data were analyzed using a quasi-experimental difference in difference design, comparing flooded and non-flooded areas and in affected and unaffected time periods. Multivariable log binomial regression models were used to estimate risk ratios, adjusted for maternal age. Marginal probabilities for the difference in difference term were used to show the potential effect of the flood. Results Participants included 18,266 nulliparous women for the pregnancy outcomes, and 26,956 women with infants for the mental health analysis. There were no effects for preterm birth (DID 0.00, CI: -0.02, 0.02), small for gestational age (DID 0.00, CI: -0.02, 0.02), or new cases of preeclampsia (DID 0.00, CI: -0.01, 0.01). There was a small increase in new cases of gestational hypertension (DID 0.02, CI: 0.01, 0.03) in flood affected areas.

Notably, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) constitute a significant determinant associated with maternal mortality and adverse birth outcomes. Despite the accumulating body of evidence, scant research has delved into the correlation between chemical components of wildfire PM2.5 and the risk of HDP. Derived from data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics, singleton births from >2.68 million pregnant women were selected across 8 states (Arizona, AZ; California, CA, Idaho, ID, Montana, MT; Nevada, NV; Oregon, OR; Utah, UT, and Wyoming, WY) in the southwestern US from 2001 to 2004. A spatiotemporal model and a Goddard Earth Observing System chemical transport model were employed to forecast daily concentrations of total and wildfire PM2.5-derived exposure. Various modeling techniques including unadjusted analyses, covariate-adjusted models, propensity-score matching, and double robust typical logit models were applied to assess the relationship between wildfire PM2.5 exposure and gestational hypertension and eclampsia. Exposure to fire PM2.5, fire-sourced black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) were associated with an augmented risk of gestational hypertension (ORPM2.5 = 1.125, 95 % CI: 1.109,1.141; ORBC = 1.247, 95 % CI: 1.214,1.281; OROC = 1.153, 95 % CI: 1.132, 1.174) and eclampsia (ORPM2.5 = 1.217, 95 % CI: 1.145,1.293; ORBC = 1.458, 95 % CI: 1.291,1.646; OROC = 1.309, 95 % CI: 1.208,1.418) during the pregnancy exposure window with the strongest effect. The associations were stronger that the observed effects of ambient PM2.5 in which the sources primarily came from urban emissions.

The impacts of climate change on kidney development during gestation and thereby on kidney function later in life have been poorly described. Clinical evidence is summarized to highlight possible associations between climate change and nephron mass. Recent findings Pregnant women are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, being less able to thermoregulate, more sensitive to the effects of dehydration, and more susceptible to infections. Exposure to heat, wildfire smoke, drought, floods and climate-related infections are associated with low birth weight, preterm birth and preeclampsia. These factors are associated with reduced nephron numbers, kidney dysfunction and higher blood pressures in offspring in later life. Exposure to air pollution is associated with higher blood pressures in children and has variable effects on estimated glomerular filtration rate. Summary Climate change has important impacts on pregnant women and their unborn children. Being born too small or too soon is associated with life-time risk of kidney disease. Climate change may therefore have a dual effect of impacting fetal kidney development and contributing to cumulative postnatal kidney injury. The impact on population kidney health of future generations may be significant.";"chronic kidney disease; climate change; developmental programming; low birth weight; preterm birth; GROWTH RESTRICTION; BLOOD-PRESSURE; BIRTH-WEIGHT; HEALTH; RISK; PREGNANCY; MITIGATION; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES; DISEASE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Objective: Assess the relationship between neighborhood soil Pb and maternal eclampsia risk. Methods: Zip code summarized high density soil survey data of New Orleans collected before and after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (HKR) were merged with pregnancy outcome data on 75,501 mothers from the Louisiana office of public health. Cross-sectional logistic regression analyses are performed testing the association between pre-HKR accumulation of Pb in soils in thirty-two neighborhoods and eclampsia risk. Then we examine whether measured declines in soil Pb following the flooding of the city resulted in corresponding reductions of eclampsia risk. Results: Cross-sectional analyses show that a one standard deviation increase in soil Pb increases the odds of eclampsia by a factor of 1.48 (95% CI: 131, 1.66).

The study aims to assess the associations between wildfire air pollution and pregnancy outcomes in the Southwestern United States. Study design: This was a retrospective cohort study. Methods: Birth records of 627,404 singleton deliveries in 2018 were obtained in eight states of the Southwestern United States and were linked to wildfire-sourced fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and their constituents (black carbon [BC] and organic carbon [OC]) during the entire gestational period. A doublerobust logistic regression model was used to assess the associations of wildfire-sourced PM2.5 exposures and preterm birth and term low birth weight, adjusting for non-fire-sourced PM2.5 exposure and individual- and area-level confounder variables. Results: Wildfire-sourced PM2.5 contributed on average 15% of the ambient total PM2.5 concentrations. For preterm birth, the strongest association was observed in the second trimester (odds ratio [OR]: 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.07 for PM2.5; 1.06, 95% CI: 1.05-1.07 for BC; 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03-1.05 for OC, per interquartile range increment of exposure), with higher risks identified among non-smokers or those with low socio-economic status. For term low birth weight, the associations with wildfiresourced PM2.5 exposures were consistently elevated for all trimesters except for the exposure averaged over the entire gestational period. Overall, the associations between wildfire-sourced PM2.5 and pregnancy outcomes were stronger than those with total PM2.5. Conclusions: Wildfire-sourced PM2.5 and its constituents are linked to higher risks of preterm birth and term low birth weight among a significant US population than the effects of ambient total PM2.5.

The empirical literature on the effects of disaster on pregnancy and the postpartum period is limited. The objective of this review was to examine the existing evidence on the effect of disasters on perinatal health. Methods. A systematic review was conducted by searching electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cinahl, PsycInfo), including literature on disasters and pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital anomalies), mental health, and child development. A total of 110 articles were identified, but many published reports were anecdotes or recommendations rather than systematic studies. The final review included 49 peer-reviewed studies that met inclusion criteria. Results. Studies addressing the World Trade Center disaster of September 11 and other terrorist attacks, environmental/chemical disasters, and natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes were identified. Disasters of various types may reduce fetal growth in some women, although there does not appear to be an effect on gestational age at birth. Severity of exposure is the major predictor of mental health issues among pregnant and postpartum women. After a disaster, mental health of the mother may more strongly influence on child development than any direct effect of disaster-related prenatal stress. Conclusions. There is evidence that disaster impacts maternal mental health and some perinatal health outcomes, particular among highly exposed women. Future research should focus on understudied outcomes such as spontaneous abortion. Relief workers and clinicians should concentrate on the most exposed women, particularly with respect to mental health. Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists Learning Objectives: After completion of this educational activity, the obstetrician/gynecologist should be better able to compare and contrast the effects of different types of disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, chemical spills) on pregnant and postpartum women in order to prepare for patient care in the aftermath of such disasters; differentiate the birth outcomes likely to be affected by disaster, in order to identify patients likely to be at high risk; and assess the extent to which pregnant and postpartum women are a uniquely vulnerable population after disaster, to assist in organizing care under such circumstances.";"WORLD-TRADE-CENTER; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; PRENATAL MATERNAL STRESS; PROJECT ICE STORM; PREGNANT-WOMEN; HURRICANE-KATRINA; MENTAL-HEALTH; CONGENITAL-MALFORMATIONS; CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Many pregnant women at this time were exposed to both the bushfires and COVID-19 restrictions. Objective: To assess the impact of exposure to bushfires and pandemic restrictions on perinatal outcomes. Methods: The study included 60 054 pregnant women who gave birth between November 2017 and December 2020 in South Sydney. Exposure cohorts were based on conception and birthing dates: 1) bushfire late pregnancy, born before lockdown; 2) bushfires in early-mid pregnancy, born during lockdown or soon after; 3) conceived during bushfires, lockdown in second trimester; 4) conceived after bushfires, pregnancy during restrictions. Exposure cohorts were compared with pregnancies in the matching periods in the two years prior. Associations between exposure cohorts and gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, hypertension, stillbirth, mode of birth, birthweight, preterm birth and small for gestational age were assessed using generalised estimating equations, adjusting for covariates. Results: A decrease in low birth weight was observed for cohort 1 (aOR 0.81, 95%CI 0.69, 0.95). Conversely, cohort 2 showed an increase in low birth weight, and increases in prelabour rupture of membranes, and caesarean sections (aOR 1.18, 95%CI 1.03, 1.37; aOR 1.21, 95%CI 1.07, 1.37; aOR 1.10 (1.02, 1.18) respectively).

Elevated counts of surgeries for cryptorchidism and congenital heart malformations were observed throughout Japan from 2012 onward. The thyroid cancer detection rate (2011 to 2016) was associated with the dose-rate at the municipality level in the Fukushima prefecture. Since the birth weight is a simple and objective indicator for gestational development and pregnancy outcome, the question arises whether the annual birth weight distribution was distorted in a dose-rate-dependent manner across Japan after Fukushima. Methods The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare provides prefecture-specific annual counts for 26.158 million live births from 1995 to 2018, of which 2.366 million births (9.04%) with weights < 2500 g. Prefecture-specific spatiotemporal trends of the low birth weight proportions were analyzed. Logistic regression allowing for level-shifts from 2012 onward was employed to test whether those level-shifts were proportional to the prefecture-specific dose-rates derived from Cs-137 deposition in the 47 Japanese prefectures. Results The overall trend of the low birth weight prevalence (LBWp) in Japan discloses a jump in 2012 with a jump odds ratio (OR) 1.020, 95%-confidence interval (1.003,1.037),p-value 0.0246. A logistic regression of LBWp on the additional dose-rate after the FDNPP accidents adjusted for prefecture-specific spatiotemporal base-line trends yields an OR per mu Sv/h of 1.098 (1.058, 1.139),p-value < 0.0001. Further adjusting the logistic regression for the annual population size and physician density of the prefectures, as well as for the counts of the dead, the missing, and the evacuees due to earthquake and tsunami (as surrogate measures for medical infrastructure and stress) yields an OR per mu Sv/h of 1.109 (1.032, 1.191),p-value 0.0046. Conclusions This study shows increased low birth weight prevalence related to the Cs-137 deposition and the corresponding additional dose-rate in Japan from 2012 onward.

It has also been proposed that stress exposure reduces the ratio of male-to-female births. To date, no study has jointly examined both outcomes, although they may be strongly related. Using population-level data with no selectivity, we jointly study the sex-specific effect of stress on the duration of pregnancy and the observed sex ratio among pregnant women exposed to a major earthquake in Chile. METHODS: In a quasi-experimental design, women exposed to the earthquake in different months of gestation were compared with women pregnant 1 year earlier. Estimates from a comparison group of pregnant women living in areas not affected by the earthquake were also examined to rule out confounding trends. Regression models were used to measure the impact of earthquake exposure on gestational age and preterm birth by sex across month of gestation. A counterfactual simulation was implemented to assess the effect of the earthquake on the secondary sex ratio accounting for the differential impact of stress on gestational age by sex. RESULTS: Earthquake exposure in Months 2 and 3 of gestation resulted in a significant decline in gestational age and increase in preterm delivery. Effects varied by sex, and were much larger for female than male pregnancies. Among females, the probability of preterm birth increased by 0.038 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.005, 0.072] in Month 2 and by 0.039 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.075) in Month 3. Comparable increases for males were insignificant at the conventional P < 0.05 level. After accounting for the sex-specific impact on gestational age, a decline in the male-to-female ratio in Month 3 of exposure was detected [-0.058 (95% CI: -0.113, -0.003)]. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal exposure to an exogenous stressor early but not late in the pregnancy affects gestational age and the probability of preterm birth. This effect is much stronger in females than males. Stress exposure in early pregnancy may also contribute to a decline in the ratio of male-to-female live births in exposed cohorts.";"maternal stress; natural disaster; gestational age; preterm birth; secondary sex ratio; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; DUTCH-HUNGER-WINTER; SELECTION IN-UTERO; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; TERRORIST ATTACKS; PRETERM BIRTH; SEPTEMBER 11; MATERNAL STRESS; FETAL SEX; CRH";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Little is known about the effects of natural disasters on pregnancy outcomes. We studied mental health and birth outcomes among women exposed to Hurricane Katrina. Methods: We collected data prospectively from a cohort of 301 women from New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Pregnant women were interviewed during pregnancy about their experiences during the hurricane, and whether they had experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or depression. High hurricane exposure was defined as having 3 or more of the 8 severe hurricane experiences, such as feeling that one's life was in danger, walking through floodwaters, or having a loved one die. Results: The frequency of low birth weight was higher in women with high hurricane exposure (14.0%) than women without high hurricane exposure (4.7%), with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.3; 95% confidence interval (0): 1.13-9.89; P < 0.01. The frequency of preterm birth was higher in women with high hurricane exposure (14.0%) than women without high hurricane exposure (6.3%), with aOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 0.82-6.38; P > 0.05. There were no significant differences in the frequency of low birth weight or preterm birth between women with PTSD or depression and women without PTSD or depression (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Women who had high hurricane exposure were at an increased risk of having low birth weight infants. Rather than a general exposure to disaster, exposure to specific severe disaster events and the intensity of the disaster experience may be better predictors of poor pregnancy outcomes. To prevent poor pregnancy outcomes during and after disasters, future disaster preparedness may need to include the planning of earlier evacuation of pregnant women to minimize their exposure to severe disaster events.";"depression; disaster; low birth weight; post-traumatic stress disorder; pregnancy; DISASTER; SUPPORT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Participants: Pregnant women (N = 175) in the third trimester that had uncomplicated pregnancies and no history of mental illness. Methods: During pregnancy, the participants completed standardized measurements of depression symptoms, perceived social support, and questionnaires concerning the effect of the flood. After giving birth, infant birth weight and gestational age at birth were retrieved from delivery records. Results: Seventy percent (n = 123) of the participants experienced displacement during the flood. The displaced women had a mean infant birth weight of 175 grams less than that of the nondisplaced women, t(173) = -2.38, p = .02, whereas infant gestational age was not different.

Conclusion: Being displaced during pregnancy due to a natural disaster affected fetal growth rather than length of gestation. Health care providers should closely monitor maternal weight gain and fetal growth of pregnant women who experience displacement. Among the displaced women, social support was associated with higher infant birth weight; therefore, high levels of perceived social support may be protective for pregnant women who experience stressful events such as displacement from flooding.";"birth outcomes; displacement; natural disaster; social support; HURRICANE-KATRINA; PREGNANT-WOMEN; STRESS; WEIGHT; CARE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Pregnant community residents who were at least 18 years old with a singleton, intrauterine pregnancy participated in the study (N = 169). Analyses examined if birth weight and length of gestation were associated with residential distance from flooding and gestational age at time of the flood crest. Results: For pregnancies earlier in gestation during the crest (-1 SD = 12 weeks), birth weight decreased as distance from flooding decreased (-42.29 g/mi, p < .01). For pregnancies later in gestation at crest (+1 SD = 26 weeks), distance was not associated with birth weight (p > .10). Biparietal growth trajectories showed a decrease in growth after the crest of the flood but only for women early in pregnancy. However, various measures of flood related and general stress or strain did not explain these effects. Length of gestation was not associated with distance from or the timing of the flood. Conclusions: Pregnant women in the first trimester who experience a major flood near their homes are at risk of having lower birth weight neonates due to a reduction in fetal growth.

Results: Eight epidemiological studies conducted in four countries and involving 1,702,252 births were included in the review. The exposure to wildfire during pregnancy was assessed in individual studies by measurement of PM2.5 (n = 2), PM10 (n = 1), Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aerosol index (n = 1), heat spots (n = 1), and by proximity of maternal residence to wildfire-affected areas (n = 3). There is some evidence indicating that maternal wildfire exposure associates with birth weight reduction (n = 7) and preterm birth (n = 4), particularly when exposure to wildfire smoke occurred in late pregnancy. The association between wildfire exposure and small for gestational age (n = 2) and infant mortality (n = 1) was inconclusive. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that maternal exposure to wildfire during late pregnancy is linked to reduced birth weight and preterm birth. Well-designed comprehensive studies are needed to better understand the perinatal effects of wildfires.";"Wildfire; Pregnancy; Adverse birth outcomes; FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; PRETERM BIRTH; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; AIR-POLLUTION; FETAL HEALTH; WEIGHT; SMOKE; QUALITY; STRESS; PM2.5";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

In an extremely hot climate, pregnant women face an increased risk of premature birth, stillbirth, low birth weight, congenital anomalies and pre-eclampsia.

The possible causes and consequences of dehydration in the heat are poorly understood and have been little discussed in the literature. Living in a hot climate poses various challenges, including dehydration, where biological mechanisms and insufficient access to water can lead to dehydration in women and children, with consequences for the health of both mothers and children, particularly in relation to breastfeeding habits. During pregnancy, increased metabolic and cardiovascular demands interact with heat exhaustion and reduced availability of fresh water, which can affect the child's growth and development. In this opinion piece, we emphasise the possible causes and impacts of dehydration in extreme heat on the health and well-being of mothers and children.

However, publications on evacuation from NICUs are sparse. The 2016 Kumamoto Earthquakes caused serious damage to Kumamoto City Hospital and its level III regional core NICU. Local/neighbour NICU teams and the disaster-communication team of a neonatal academic society cooperated to evacuate 38 newborn infants from the ward. Objective: The aim of this paper was to highlight potential key factors to improve emergency NICU evacuation and coordination of hospital transportation following natural disasters. Methods: Background variables including clinical risk scores and timing/destination of transportation were compared between infants, who subsequently were transferred to destinations outside of Kumamoto Prefecture, and their peers. Results: All but 1 of the infants were successfully evacuated from their NICU within 8 h. One very-low-birth-weight infant developed moderate hypothermia following transportation. Fourteen infants were transferred to NICUs outside of Kumamoto Prefecture, which was associated with the diagnosis of congenital heart disease, dependence on respiratory support, higher risk scores, and longer elapsed time from the decision to departure. There was difficulty in arranging helicopter transportation because the coordination office of the Disaster Medical Assistance Team had requisitioned most air/ground ambulances and only helped arrange ground transportations for 13 low-risk infants. Transportation for all 10 high-risk infants (risk scores greater than or equal to the upper quartile) was arranged by local/neighbour NICUs. Conclusions: Although the overall evacuation process was satisfactory, potential risks of relying on the adult-based emergency transportation system were highlighted. A better system needs to be developed urgently to put appropriate priority on vulnerable infants. (C) 2017 S.

Understanding the infiltration of outdoor wildfire smoke into a residential space is critical for the accurate assessment of wildfire smoke exposure and associated health effects in pregnant people. Relying on ambient measurements of wildfire smoke alone can result in exposure misclassification. In this study, we examine the role of physical housing characteristics in the relationship between smoke exposure and preterm birth. In particular, we examine the effect of home size, year of construction, cooling type, and renovation status, as effect modifiers in the relationship between smoke exposure during pregnancy and preterm birth from 2007 to 2015 in California. To do this, we combined data on home characteristics from the California Tax Assessor, birth outcomes from the California birth records database, and the number of smoke days for each pregnancy from theNOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Hazard Mapping System (HMS). We estimated the association between smoke day exposures and odds of preterm birth using logistic regression models and stratified by air basin and housing characteristics. Our findings reveal that cooling type and renovation status are key factors modifying the smoke exposure-preterm birth relationship. Notably, we found elevated associations for people living in unrenovated homes, those using evaporative cooling systems, and those using central air conditioning units. While we observed elevated odds of preterm birth associated with increasing smoke day exposure for residents of large and new homes, this effect does not significantly differ across home size and age quartiles.

This review summarizes recent literature regarding the impacts of climate change and related environmental disasters on pregnancy health and provides recommendations to inform future adaptation and mitigation efforts. Recent Findings Accumulating evidence suggests that the changing climate affects pregnancy health directly via discrete environmental disasters (i.e., wildfire, extreme heat, hurricane, flood, and drought), and indirectly through changes in the natural and social environment. Although studies vary greatly in design, analytic methods, and assessment strategies, they generally converge to suggest that climate-related disasters are associated with increased risk of gestational complication, pregnancy loss, restricted fetal growth, low birthweight, preterm birth, and selected delivery/newborn complications. Window(s) of exposure with the highest sensitivity are not clear, but both acute and chronic exposures appear important. Furthermore, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations may be more vulnerable. Policy, clinical, and research strategies for adaptation and mitigation should be continued, strengthened, and expanded with cross-disciplinary efforts. Top priorities should include (a) reinforcing and expanding policies to further reduce emission, (b) increasing awareness and education resources for healthcare providers and the public, (c) facilitating access to quality population-based data in low-resource areas, and (d) research efforts to better understand mechanisms of effects, identify susceptible populations and windows of exposure, explore interactive impacts of multiple exposures, and develop novel methods to better quantify pregnancy health impacts.";"Climate change; Environmental disaster; Extreme weather; Pregnancy health; Perinatal health; ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES; AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; RESIDENTIAL PROXIMITY; MATERNAL EXPOSURE; FOOD INSECURITY; OCCUPATIONAL-EXPOSURE; TEMPERATURE EXPOSURE; DRINKING-WATER; NORTH-CAROLINA; INCREASED RISK";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

We employ this strategy to estimate the effect of exposure to severe tornadoes on infant birth weight in the United States from 1991 to 2017. We merge county month data on singleton births with block group level monthly data on the paths of severe tornadoes and block group data on the distribution of the population at risk of a birth. We then estimate difference indifferences models in which the treatment variable is equal to the percentage of the population at risk of a birth affected by the tornado. This strategy results in an estimand that is both more interpretable and more policyrelevant than estimands from traditional models.

Few studies have examined whether hurricane exposure is associated with preterm delivery. We aimed to estimate associations between maternal hurricane exposure and hazard of preterm delivery. Methods We used data on 342,942 singleton births from Florida Vital Statistics Records 2004-2005 to capture pregnancies at risk of delivery during the 2004 hurricane season. Maternal exposure to Hurricane Charley was assigned based on maximum wind speed in maternal county of residence. We estimated hazards of overall preterm delivery (<37 gestational weeks) and extremely preterm delivery (<32 gestational weeks) in Cox regression models, adjusting for maternal/pregnancy characteristics. To evaluate heterogeneity among racial/ethnic subgroups, we performed analyses stratified by race/ethnicity. Additional models investigated whether exposure to multiples hurricanes increased hazard relative to exposure to one hurricane. Results Exposure to wind speeds >= 39 mph from Hurricane Charley was associated with a 9 % (95 % CI 3, 16 %) increase in hazard of extremely preterm delivery, while exposure to wind speed >= 74 mph was associated with a 21 % (95 % CI 6, 38 %) increase. Associations appeared greater for Hispanic mothers compared to non-Hispanic white mothers. Hurricane exposure did not appear to be associated with hazard of overall preterm delivery.

However, no study has yet explored this in the context of delay discounting (DD), which refers to the tendency to prefer smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed ones. Both prenatal factors, such as LBW, and postnatal factors, including adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and exposure to natural disasters, may influence DD. To investigate whether LBW children seek larger future rewards, we analyzed LBW's effect on DD, accounting for ACEs and natural disaster exposure. This prospective cohort study involved 167 children from areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE), with a mean age of 8.3 years at the time of the DD experiment. LBW was assessed in the 2012 baseline questionnaire using the Mother-Child Handbook, along with ACEs prior to the GEJE and traumatic earthquake experiences. In 2014, DD was assessed through a token-based experiment where children allocated tokens for either immediate rewards (one candy per token for ""now"") or delayed rewards (two candies per token for ""one month later""). Our results showed that children with LBW and three or more ACEs exhibited lower DD, while traumatic earthquake experiences were not associated with DD. These findings suggest that children with LBW and multiple ACEs may develop adaptive strategies to seek more resources, indicating a responsive reward system to childhood adversity, even after exposure to a severe natural disaster.";"Adverse childhood experiences; delay discounting; great East Japan earthquake; low birthweight; EARLY-LIFE ADVERSITY; TIME-PREFERENCES; HEALTH; BRAIN; EXPERIENCES; STRESS; GRATIFICATION; GROWTH; CORTEX; RISK";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Animal models have been indispensable in defining the mechanisms responsible for these associations and the potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Among the modifiable risk factors, micronutrient deficiency, physical immobility, exaggerated stress hormone exposure and deficient trophic hormone production are leading candidates for targeted therapies. With the strong inverse relationship seen between gestational age at delivery and the risk of hypertension in adulthood trumping all other major cardiovascular risk factors, improvements in neonatal care are required. Unfortunately, therapeutic breakthroughs have not kept pace with rapidly improving perinatal survival, and groundbreaking benchto-bedside studies are urgently needed to mitigate and ultimately prevent the tsunami of prematurity-related adult cardiovascular disease that may be on the horizon.

Extreme weather events (EWEs), along with other factors such as socioeconomic and cultural factors, influence population dynamics, particularly changes in fertility, mortality, and migration. This study focuses solely on the fertility aspect of climate change and aims to investigate it in Bangladesh, which is extremely sensitive to climate change and EWEs such as floods, cyclones, and droughts. On a regular basis, the country is confronted with a number of EWEs. The current study examines how different types of extreme weather events affect vulnerable people's decisions to have children or to prefer children of a certain gender. People who reside in a particular area may be more vulnerable to particular EWE types, which may result in different preferences for fertility and gender. This study employed individual-level data from three places (flood-prone, drought-prone, and cyclone-prone), each exposed to a distinct hazard, to address this issue, and collected pertinent information from 177 respondents in the susceptible areas using a survey questionnaire. The quantitative results show that the gender of the first child, the perceived risk of infant death due to EWE, the opinion on having more children to recover from the damage and losses caused by EWE, government and non-governmental organization (NGO) support during EWE, and the intended timing of child bearing (after or before EWE) are all significant factors influencing fertility preferences and gender preferences. The findings also indicate that the three regions under investigation have statistically distinct preferences for fertility and gender. There were larger differences between flood-prone areas and drought- and cyclone-prone areas. The complex issue of variations due to different EWEs requires more in-depth studies with larger samples and different methodological techniques.";"Bangladesh; extreme weather events; fertility preference; gender preference; intended fertility timing; perceived risk of dying; FAMILY-SIZE PREFERENCES; SOCIAL NETWORKS; WOMEN; POPULATION; MORTALITY; LIVELIHOODS; ENVIRONMENT; RESILIENCE; DISASTERS; DECISION";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Although some research has been conducted into the adverse health impacts of POs, significant gaps remain regarding whether POs would affect the health of pregnant women. We investigated the association between ED visits due to pregnancy complications and the occurence, intensity, and duration of large-scale POs in eight Sandy-affected counties in New York State (NYS). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, daily ED visits for pregnancy complications and large-scale POdata in eight counties in NYS from October to December in 2005-2014 were collected. Using time-series analysis, we estimated the relative increase in ED visits for pregnancy complications during POs compared with non-PO periods at lag 0-7 days. Short-term health impacts of PO intensity and PO duration were investigated. Estimations were also stratified by sociodemographic characteristics and disease subtypes including threatened or spontaneous abortion, threatened or early labor, hypertension complications, infections of genitourinary tract, renal diseases, gestational diabetes mellitus, mental illnesses, and cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy. Results: From October to December in 2005-2014, there were 307,739 ED visits for pregnancy complications in the eight counties. We found significant increases in ED visits for overall pregnancy complications (16.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.3%, 23.2%) during the Hurricane-PO period at lag 0-7 days. The ED visits increased by 8.8% per level increase in PO intensity and 1.4% per day increase in PO duration.

However, no studies in Japan have classified infant mortality trends into neonatal and postneonatal or considered regional issues. This study aimed to explore trends in neonatal and postneonatal deaths, both overall for Japan and in a region affected by a natural disaster. Methods: Drawing on national infant death data, we used a multi-attribute compositional study design to examine all infant deaths occurring in a region affected by a disaster (Tohoku, which consists of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima) between 2002 and 2012. We used conjoint analysis to clarify the associations between infant and maternal characteristics and age of infant death. Results: We obtained data of a total of 31,012 infant deaths between 2002 and 2012, which included 1450 from Tohoku. Infant mortality rates in Japan overall declined over the period but increased in 2011. There were more postneonatal (29-364 days post-birth) than neonatal (0-28 days post-birth) deaths. Infant deaths in Tohoku declined slightly overall, with a fluctuation in 2011. In Tohoku, the trends in postneonatal death rates were similar; the overall rates for males increased, but those for females decreased in 2011. We found that the cause and place of infant death differed by gender for neonatal and postneonatal deaths in both Japan in general and Tohoku. The conjoint analysis showed that most variables affected the age of postneonatal death. The factor with the largest influence on the variation in infant death age was gestational week (55.5%). A maternal gestational week <= 36 was linked to an average age at death of 43.4 days, and > 37 was linked to an average of 83.7 days. Conclusions: In Japan, infant death rates have declined steadily over the past 10 years. The recent trends indicated that postneonatal death rates were higher than neonatal rates, especially in Tohoku. However, not much attention has been focused on postneonatal deaths in Japan. Our findings may help health planners to prioritise work on the factors that are linked to infant deaths in the neonatal and postneonatal periods.";"Trends in infant mortality; Neonatal/postneonatal; Causes of death; Conjoint analysis; Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami; Japan; IMPACT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Recent work from the PROTECT study confirms that in utero exposure to certain phthalates is associated with shorter gestation and increased risk of preterm birth. However, previous research also suggests that pregnant women who experience a natural disaster such as Hurricane Maria are at higher risk of adverse birth outcomes, but it is unknown whether this is due to stress, hazardous exposures, or a combination of factors. Thus, the aim of this analysis was to characterize hurricane-related changes in phthalate exposures and experiences within the PROTECT cohort. Among 176 participants who were pregnant during or within 5 months after Maria, 122 completed a questionnaire on hurricane-related experiences. Questionnaire results and biomarkers of exposure suggest that participants did not have regular access to fresh foods and water during hurricane recovery, and almost half reported structural damage to their home. In addition, biomarker concentrations of phthalates commonly used in food packaging were higher among participants post-hurricane, while phthalates commonly used in personal care products were lower compared to pre-hurricane levels. Hurricane-related increases in phthalate exposure, as well as widespread structural damage, food and water shortages, and long-term absence of electricity and cell phone service, likely increased the risk of adverse birth outcomes among this already vulnerable population.";"Puerto Rico; Hurricane Maria; Pregnancy; Birth cohort; Environmental exposures; PHTHALATE EXPOSURE; REPRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES; PREGNANCY; STRESS; HEALTH; WOMEN; FETAL; DISASTERS; CONSEQUENCES; EPIDEMIOLOGY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Low birth weight (LBW) is a critical global health concern, contributing to neonatal mortality. However, the association between floods and LBW remains underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the association between flood hazards and LBW in India using a geospatial approach. By analyzing data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) and flood zonation maps, the study aims to uncover the spatial dynamics of this association, offering insights into the implications of floods on birth weight across diverse geographical regions.Methods: The study used the fifth round of NFHS data, 2019-21, which involved 202,194 children selected through a multi-stage stratified sampling technique. The Vulnerability Atlas of India 2019 maps were also uti-lized to classify areas as flood or non-flood zones. Birth weight data from the NFHS-5 were categorized into three groups: very low, low, and normal birth weight (VLBW, LBW and NBW). Control variables including flood exposure, socio-demographic attributes, and geographic region were considered. Bivariate analysis and multi-nomial logistic regression were employed for statistical analysis. The spatial analysis involved Moran's I statistics and Geographically Weighted Regression to explore spatial dynamics of the association between floods and birth weight in India.Results: Floods predominantly affect India's lower Himalayan belts and western coastal regions. Flood-affected areas show higher proportions of VLBW and LBW infants. Groundwater usage and unimproved sanitation are associated with higher risk of VLBW and LBW. Sex, wealth, maternal education, residence type, and geographic region significantly influence birth weights. Multinomial logistic regression reveals 8 % and 27 % higher risks for LBW and VLBW in flood-affected regions. LISA cluster maps identify high-risk areas for both LBW and floods. Geographically Weighted Regression highlights 52 % of the variability in LBW occurrences can be attributed to the influence of flood hazards. Families hailing from the poorest wealth background and exposed to flood hazards bear a 5 % heightened likelihood of delivering LBW infants, in stark contrast to their counterparts from the same economic background yet unaffected by floods.Conclusions: The significant association between floods and LBW underscores the importance of robust disaster preparedness and public health strategies. By unraveling the spatial intricacies of flood-induced LBW disparities, this research provides valuable insights for promoting healthier birth outcomes and reducing child mortality rates, particularly in flood-prone regions. These findings emphasize the importance of holistic policies that address both environmental challenges and socioeconomic inequalities to safeguard maternal and infant health across the nation.";"Flood; Low birth weight; Geospatial analysis; Environmental health; NFHS-5; STRESS; DISASTER; OUTCOMES; HEALTH; IMPACT; AREA";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

We estimated the likelihood of pre- and early-term births using logistic regression, comparing births occurring during or within 1, 2, or 4 weeks of Hurricane Harvey to unexposed reference periods encompassing the same dates 2 years prior and after. Stratified models assessed effect modification by degree of flooding, birth parent age, high- vs. low-risk pregnancy, race/ethnicity, and prenatal care. Results: Among 15,564 births, we found no association between exposure to Hurricane Harvey and spontaneous preterm birth within 1 week adjusted (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91, 1.25) but a 14% higher odds of spontaneous early-term birth (OR, 1.14; 95% CI = 1.04, 1.25). The odds of early-term birth were even higher in neighborhoods with severe flooding (OR, 1.21; 95% CI = 1.05, 1.38), segregated neighborhoods (OR, 1.23; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.47), and among foreign-born Hispanics (OR, 1.21; 95% CI = 1.04, 1.53) and pregnant people receiving no prenatal care (OR, 1.37; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.82). Effect estimates were attenuated or null when considering 2-week or 4-week lags to define exposure. Conclusions: Hurricane Harvey was associated with higher odds of spontaneous early-term birth up to 1 week later, especially among socially marginalized populations.";"UNITED-STATES; CARE UTILIZATION; HEALTH; OUTCOMES; EXPOSURE; KATRINA; DISPARITIES; PREGNANCY; IMPACT; LOUISIANA";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Objectives: To examine the relationship between oil spill exposure and birth outcomes in a cohort of women living near the Gulf of Mexico at the time of the 2010 oil spill. Methods: Between 2012 and 2016, 1375 women reported their exposure to the oil spill, and at least one livebirth. Five hundred and three had births both before and after the oil spill. Indicators of oil spill exposure included selfreported financial consequences, direct contact with oil, traumatic experiences, loss of use of the coast, and involvement in litigation. Birth outcomes were low birthweight (LBW; birthweight <2500 g) and preterm birth (PTB; >3 weeks early). Women who were not pregnant at the time of the interview (n = 1001) self-reported outcomes, while women who were pregnant (n = 374) primarily had them abstracted from medical records (n = 374). All pregnancies prior to the oil spill were considered unexposed; those after the oil spill were considered exposed or unexposed depending on interview responses. Generalized estimating equations were used to control for clustering within women, with control for confounders. Results: The most common type of exposure was economic (49%), but 302 women (22.0%) reported some degree of direct contact with the oil. Associations between most indicators of oil spill exposure and pregnancy outcomes were null, although when all pregnancies were examined, associations were seen with high levels of contact with oil for LBW (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 2.19, 95% CI, 1.29-3.71) and PTB (aOR 2.27, 1.34-3.87).

Methods We included 73,493 women who delivered in 96 hospitals in 24 provinces and autonomous regions from the 2015/16 China Labor and Delivery Survey. We weighted the multivariable logistic models based on the combination of coarsened exact matching (CEM) weight and survey weight, and performed sex-stratified analysis to test whether associations of maternal earthquake exposure with adverse birth outcomes (Stillbirth, preterm birth [PTB], low birthweight [LBW], and small for gestational age [SGA]) varied by sex. Results The bivariate models showed that the weighted incidence of each adverse birth outcome was higher in exposed group than unexposed group: stillbirth (2.00% vs. 1.33%), PTB (14.14% vs. 7.32%), LBW (10.82% vs. 5.76%), and SGA (11.32% vs. 9.52%). The multivariable models showed maternal earthquake exposure was only associated significantly with a higher risk of PTB in offspring among all births (adjusted risk ratio [aRR](95%CI):1.25(1.06-1.48),P = 0.010). The sex-stratified analysis showed the association was significant among male births (aRR (95%CI): 1.40(1.12-1.75),P = 0.002),but unsignificant among female births. The sensitivity analysis reported similar findings. Conclusions The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake exposure has a long-term effect on PTB.

I show that children exposed to severe floods in utero, especially during the third trimester, are shorter in stature five and seven years later. Also, children affected by the floods in the first trimester of pregnancy score lower on cognitive tests. Additionally, I explore potential mechanisms by studying health at birth and family inputs (income, consumption, and breastfeeding).

Furthermore, households affected by El Nino suffered a decline in income, total consumption, and food consumption in the aftermath of the shock.

The short-notice evacuation had destabilizing consequences for residents, including changes in routines, loss of control, and increased uncertainty. These consequences were especially detrimental to women who were pregnant or pre-conception during the evacuation. Pregnant and pre-conception women are particularly susceptible to a vast range of negative consequences during and post natural disasters, including elevated stress and higher incidence of pregnancy complications including gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy induced hypertension and C-section. The aim of this study was to understand the experiences, perceived stress and resilience of women who were pregnant during the wildfire. As well as to explore potential interventions to promote the health and enhance resilience of pregnant women and to assist in recovery after exposure to a natural disaster or other traumatic events. MethodsA qualitative thematic analysis of 16 narratives penned by pregnant women and recounted in Ashley Tobin's compilations 93/88,000 and 159 More/ 88,000: Stories of Evacuation, Re-Entry and the In-Between was conducted. ResultsAnalysis revealed five key themes: (1) experience of stress responses due to personal and external factors, (2) social connectedness and support as a facilitator of resilience, (3) performance of resilience-enhancing activities, (4) the roles of pregnancy and motherhood in the experiences of loss and resilience, and (5) the importance of home. ConclusionPregnant women have unique barriers that may negatively impact them during a natural disaster or other form of stressful event. They may benefit from assistance with navigating role transition during pregnancy, training in stress management strategies, and writing interventions to build resiliency and begin the process of recovery from trauma.";"stress; resilience; pregnancy; natural disasters; factors of resilience; PRENATAL MATERNAL STRESS; NATURAL DISASTER; BIRTH OUTCOMES; IDENTITY; MOTHER";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

This study aimed to investigate the association between drought and risk of infant mortality in Africa, a region highly vulnerable to climate change that bears the heaviest share of the global burden.Methods and findings In this cross-sectional study, we obtained data on infant mortality in 34 African countries during 1992-2019 from the Demographic and Health Surveys program. We measured drought by the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index at a timescale of 24 months and a spatial resolution of 10 x 10 km, which was further dichotomized into mild and severe drought. The association between drought exposure and infant mortality risk was estimated using Cox regression models allowing time-dependent covariates. We further examined whether the association varied for neonatal and post-neonatal mortality and whether there was a delayed association with drought exposure during pregnancy or infancy. The mean (standard deviation) number of months in which children experienced any drought during pregnancy and survival period (from birth through death before 1 year of age) was 4.6 (5.2) and 7.3 (7.4) among cases and non-cases, respectively. Compared to children who did not experience drought, we did not find evidence that any drought exposure was associated with an increased risk of infant mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.00, 1.04], p = 0.072). When stratified by drought severity, we found a statistically significant association with severe drought (HR: 1.04; 95% CI [1.01, 1.07], p = 0.015), but no significant association with mild drought (HR: 1.01; 95% CI [0.99, 1.03], p = 0.353), compared to non-exposure to any drought. However, when excluding drought exposure during pregnancy, the association with severe drought was found to be non-significant. In addition, an increased risk of neonatal mortality was associated with severe drought (HR: 1.05; 95% CI [1.01, 1.10], p = 0.019), but not with mild drought (HR: 0.99; 95% CI [0.96, 1.02], p = 0.657).Methods and findings In this cross-sectional study, we obtained data on infant mortality in 34 African countries during 1992-2019 from the Demographic and Health Surveys program.

When stratified by drought severity, we found a statistically significant association with severe drought (HR: 1.04; 95% CI [1.01, 1. 07], p = 0.015), but no significant association with mild drought (HR: 1.01; 95% CI [0.99, 1.03], p = 0.353), compared to non-exposure to any drought. However, when excluding drought exposure during pregnancy, the association with severe drought was found to be non-significant. In addition, an increased risk of neonatal mortality was associated with severe drought (HR: 1.05; 95% CI [1.01, 1.10], p = 0.019), but not with mild drought (HR: 0.99; 95% CI [0.96, 1.02], p = 0.657).Conclusions Exposure to long-term severe drought was associated with increased infant mortality risk in Africa. Our findings urge more effective adaptation measures and alleviation strategies against the adverse impact of drought on child health.";"HEALTH SURVEYS; WATER-QUALITY; ASSOCIATION; OUTCOMES; HAZARDS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Totally 13,003 of neonates were recorded, with 6638 and 6365 for pre- and post-earthquake, respectively. Significant low birthweight, high ratio of low birthweight, and low Apgar scores of post-earthquake group were observed. In contrast, the sex ratio at birth, birth length and length of gestation did not show statistical differences. The overall ratio of birth-defect in the post-earthquake (1.18%) is statistically high than that of pre- earthquake (0.99%), especially for those in the first trimester on earthquake day (1.47%). The birth-defect spectrum was dramatically altered after earthquake, with the markedly increased occurrences of ear malformations. The ratio of preterm birth post-earthquake (7.41%) is significant increased than that of pre- earthquake (5.63%). For the birth outcomes of twins, significant differences of the ratio of twins, birth weight, ratio of low birthweight and birth-defect rate were observed after earthquake.

Puerto Rico-a U.S. territory with a colonial history-offers a unique case for examining how multiple disasters, including Hurricane Maria, ongoing earthquakes, and the COVID-19 pandemic, interact with structural vulnerabilities to affect maternal and child health. Despite increasing attention to climate-related health outcomes, little is known about the reproductive health impacts of cumulative disaster exposure in colonial contexts.MethodsWe used U.S. National Vital Statistics System data (2017-2021) to assess associations between disaster exposure and six maternal and newborn outcomes: preterm birth, low birthweight, term low birthweight, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, and excessive weight gain. Disaster exposure was defined based on the timing of hurricanes and the pandemic, using a three-month lag period. We analyzed data from Puerto Rico and used Florida and Texas as comparison sites. Multivariable log-binomial regression models estimated adjusted prevalence ratios. Effect modification was tested for (1) region within Puerto Rico and (2) colonial status, comparing Puerto Rico (territory) to Florida and Texas (states). Simulations were conducted to account for potential live-birth bias.ResultsAcross 104,560 births in Puerto Rico, disaster periods were consistently associated with worse maternal health outcomes. For example, during the late post-hurricane period, gestational diabetes increased (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31), while term low birthweight surprisingly appeared to decline (RR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.98). Associations with newborn health were mixed and may have been underestimated due to sharp declines in live births after disasters. Simulations suggested stronger disaster-related risks than observed in primary analyses. Effect modification by region and colonial status showed inconsistent but notable differences, particularly elevated maternal health risks in certain regions of Puerto Rico and compared to U.S. states.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that multiple disasters negatively affect reproductive health in Puerto Rico and that structural factors, including colonialism, may exacerbate these impacts. Public health responses must account for cumulative disaster exposure and systemic inequities to better support maternal and child health in marginalized settings, especially as climate change continues to intensify.";"Maternal health; Child health; Disasters; Colonialism; Climate change; Puerto Rico; Health inequities; Reproductive health; COVID-19 pandemic; Environmental Justice; ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES; HURRICANE-KATRINA; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; PREGNANCY; IMPACT; DISPARITIES; RESILIENCE; DEPRESSION; DISASTERS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

However, a comprehensive synthesis of the current evidence on the health impacts of ambient wildfire smoke on children and adolescents, an exceptionally vulnerable population, is lacking. We conduct a systematic review of peer-reviewed epidemiological studies on the association between wildfire smoke and health of children and adolescents.Recent FindingsWe searched for studies available in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus from database inception up to October 11, 2022. Of 4926 studies initially identified, 59 studies from 14 countries were ultimately eligible. Over 33.3% of the studies were conducted in the USA, and two focused on multi-countries. The exposure assessment of wildfire smoke was heterogenous, with wildfire-specific particulate matters with diameters <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5, 22.0%) and all-source (22.0%) PM2.5 during wildfire period most frequently used. Over half of studies (50.6%) focused on respiratory-related morbidities/mortalities. Wildfire smoke exposure was consistently associated with enhanced risks of adverse health outcomes in children/adolescents. Meta-analysis results presented a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.12) for all-cause respiratory morbidity, 1.11 (95% Ci: 0.93-1.32) for asthma, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85-1.03) for bronchitis, and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.05-1.23) for upper respiratory infection, whilst - 21.71 g for birth weight (95% CI, - 32.92 to - 10.50) per 10 mu g/m3 increment in wildfire-specific PM2.5/all-source PM2.5 during wildfire event.SummaryThe majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with multiple adverse health outcomes among children and adolescents, with respiratory morbidities of significant concern. In-utero exposure to wildfire smoke may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes and have long-term impacts on height. Higher maternal baseline exposure to wildfire smoke and poor family-level baseline birthweight respectively elevated risks in preterm birth and low birth weight associated with wildfire smoke. More studies in low- and middle-income countries and focusing on extremely young children are needed. Despite technological progress, wildfire smoke exposure measurements remain uncertain, demanding improved methodologies to have more precise assessment of wildfire smoke levels and thus quantify the corresponding health impacts and guide public mitigation actions.";"Wildfire smoke; Air pollution; Children/adolescent health; Meta-analysis; Systematic reviews; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES; AIR-POLLUTION; FIRE SMOKE; HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; FOREST-FIRES; EXPOSURE; MORTALITY; ASSOCIATIONS; SYMPTOMS; OUTCOMES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Negative effects may also occur in the unborn, exposed to disaster stressors when critical organ systems are developing and when the consequences of exposure are large. Methods We exploit spatial and temporal variation in hurricane behaviour as a quasi-experimental design to assess whether fetal death is dose-responsive in the extent of hurricane damage. Data on births and fetal deaths are merged with Parish-level housing wreckage data. Fetal outcomes are regressed on housing wreckage adjusting for the maternal, fetal, placental and other risk factors. The average causal effect of maternal exposure to hurricane destruction is captured by difference-indifferences analyses. Results The adjusted odds of fetal death are 1.40 (1.07-1.83) and 2.37 (1.684-3.327) times higher in parishes suffering 10-50% and >50% wreckage to housing stock, respectively. For every 1% increase in the destruction of housing stock, we observe a 1.7% (1.1-2.4%) increase in fetal death. Of the 410 officially recorded fetal deaths in these parishes, between 117 and 205 may be attributable to hurricane destruction and postdisaster disorder. The estimated fetal death toll is 17.4-30.6% of the human death toll. Conclusions The destruction caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita imposed significant measurable losses in terms of fetal death.

Although there have been tremendous strides made in reducing infant mortality rates largely due to vaccinations and improved standards of living, a lot remains to be done to reduce neonatal mortality. Achievement of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) number 4 on childhood mortality will remain unattainable in most developing countries unless purpose based interventions targeted at reducing neonatal mortality are instituted. This viewpoint is based on the experiences gained in Eritrea, a country that gained independence less than twenty years ago following a protracted war that left a trail of destruction of infrastructure in general and health facilities in particular. War that broke out with Ethiopia less than 10 years into its independence and border conflicts followed by a no peace no war stalemate situation aggravated by frequent droughts have continued to throttle economic recovery, reconstruction and rehabilitative efforts.

This study aimed to examine effects of the Great East Japan Earthquake on perinatal outcomes using vital statistics of Japan. Methods: Birth registration data from vital statistics of Japan between March 2010 and March 2012 were used. Pregnant women who experienced the earthquake were categorized according to their gestational period as of March 11, 2011, as follows: gestational weeks 4-11, 12-19, 20-27, and 28-36 (2011 group). Similarly, pregnant women who did not experience the earthquake were categorized according to their gestational period as of March 11, 2010 and used as controls (2010 group). We also categorized prefectures as ""extremely affected"", ""moderately affected"", and ""slightly or unaffected"" regions. SSR, birth weight, and gestational period were compared between both groups. Results: The number of singleton births was 688 479 in the 2010 group and 679 131 in the 2011 group. In the extremely affected region, the SSR among women at 4-11 weeks of gestation was significantly lower in the 2011 group compared with the 2010 group (49.8% vs 52.1%, P = 0.009). In the extremely affected region, children born to women who experienced the earthquake at 28-36 weeks of gestation had significantly lower birth weights. Conclusions: The SSR declined among women who experienced the earthquake during early pregnancy, particularly in the extremely affected region.

This systematic review evaluated the association between maternal exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy and the risk of perinatal, obstetric, and early childhood health outcomes. Methods: We searched CINAHL Complete, Ovid/EMBASE, Ovid/MEDLINE, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant epidemiological observational studies indexed through September 2023. The screening of titles, abstracts, and full-texts, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment was performed by pairs of independent reviewers.Results: Our systematic search yielded 28,549 records. After duplicate removal, we screened 14,009 studies, identifying 31 for inclusion in the present review. Data extraction highlighted high methodological heterogeneity between studies, including a lack of geographic variation. Approximately 56.5% and 16% originated in the United States and Brazil, respectively, and fewer in other countries. Among the studies, wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy was assessed using distance of residence from wildfire-affected areas (n = 15), measurement of air pollutant concentration during wildfires (n = 11), number of wildfire records (n = 3), aerosol index (n = 1), and geographic hot spots (n = 1). Pooled meta-analysis for birthweight and low birthweight were inconclusive, likely due to low number of methodologically homogenous studies. However, the reviewed studies provided suggestive evidence for an increased risk of birthweight reduction, low birthweight, preterm birth, and other adverse health outcomes.Conclusions: This review identified 31 studies evaluating the impacts of maternal wildfire smoke exposure on maternal, infant, and child health. Although we found suggestive evidence of harm from exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy, more methodologically homogenous studies are required to enable future meta -analysis with greater statistical power to more accurately evaluate the association between maternal wildfire smoke and adverse birth outcomes and other health outcomes.";"Wildfire; Air pollution; Pregnancy; Birthweight; Preterm birth; Obstetric; BIRTH-WEIGHT; PARTICULATE MATTER; CALIFORNIA; STRESS; COHORT; PM2.5";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72·3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71·2-73·2) of deaths in 2016 with 19·3% (18·5-20·4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8·43% (8·00-8·67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16-age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1·80 million deaths (95% UI 1·59 million to 1·89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2·89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1·59%) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a national policy mandating second-trimester cervical length screening by ultrasound, followed by vaginal progesterone treatment for short cervical length in comparison with no screening strategy. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a decision model comparing 2 strategies, namely (1) universal cervical length screening, and (2) no screening strategy. This study used the national delivery registry of Israel's Ministry of Health. All women diagnosed with a second-trimester cervical length <25 mm were treated with vaginal progesterone and were monitored with a bimonthly ultrasound scan for cervical dynamics and threat of early delivery. Preterm birth prevalence associated with short cervical length, the efficacy of progesterone in preterm birth prevention, and the accuracy of cervical length measurements were derived from previous studies. The cost of progesterone and bimonthly sonographic surveillance, low birthweight delivery, newborn admission to intensive care units, the first-year costs of managing preterm birth and low birthweight, and instances of handicaps and the cost of their follow-up were extracted from the publicly posted registry of Israel's Ministry of Health and Israel Social Securities data. Monte Carlo simulations decision tree mode, Tornado diagrams, and 1 and 2-way sensitivity analyses were implemented and the base case and sensitivity to parameters that were predicted to influence cost-effectiveness were calculated. RESULTS: Without cervical length screening, the discounted quality-adjusted life years were 30.179, and with universal cervical length screening, it increased to 30.198 (difference of 0.018 quality-adjusted life years). The average cost of no screening for cervical length strategy was $1047, and for universal cervical length screening, it was reduced to $998. The calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was -$2676 per quality-adjusted life year (dividing the difference in costs by the difference in quality-adjusted life years). Monte Carlo simulation of cervical length screening of 170,000 singleton newborns (rounded large number close to the number of singleton newborns in Israel) showed that 95.17% of all babies were delivered at gestational week >= 37 in comparison with 94.46% of babies with the no screening strategy. Given 170,000 singleton births, the national savings of screening for short cervical length when compared with no cervical length screening amounted to $8.31M annually, equating to $48.84 for a base case, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each case of low birthweight or very low birthweight avoided was -$14,718. A cervical length <25 mm was measured for 30,090 women, and of those, 24,650 were false positives. The major parameters that affected the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were the incidence of preterm birth, the specificity of cervical length measurements, and the efficacy of progesterone treatment. At a preterm birth incidence of <3%, universal screening does not lead to a cost saving. CONCLUSION: National universal cervical length screening should be incorporated into the routine anomaly scan in the second trimester, because it leads to a drop in the incidence of preterm birth and low birth weight babies in singleton pregnancies, thereby saving costs related to the newborn and gaining quality-adjusted life years.";"incremental cost-effectiveness ratios; low birth weight; pre-term birth; progesterone; quality-adjusted life year; short cervical length; Tornedo analysis; transabdominal ultrasound; transvaginal ultrasound; universal screening; very low birth weight; gestational age; Israel ministry of Health; health Management Organization; first year cost; PRETERM BIRTH; VAGINAL PROGESTERONE; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; RISK; RECOMMENDATIONS; OUTCOMES; HEALTH";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

METHODS: Using an institutional perinatal database from two hospitals in Houston, Texas, women with nonanomalous singletons delivering after 24 weeks of gestation between August 2011 and June 2018 were included. To evaluate the possible association of hurricane landfall with pregnancy outcomes, gravid women delivering within 280 days (40 weeks of gestation) on or after August 25, 2017 (the day of hurricane landfall) were categorized as exposed, and women who delivered before August 25, 2017, were the reference group. Composite maternal morbidity included any of the following: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, chorioamnionitis, endometritis, blood transfusion, peripartum hysterectomy, maternal critical care admission, pulmonary edema, or maternal death. Composite neonatal morbidity included any of the following: 5-minute Apgar score 3 or less, respiratory distress syndrome, use of ventilator or continuous positive airway pressure, suspected newborn sepsis, seizure, stillbirth, or neonatal death. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated after correcting for possible confounders identified on univariate analysis. Disruption in outcome trends were measured in time series analyses. RESULTS: Of 40,502 deliveries in our database, 29,179 (72%) met the inclusion criteria, with 3,842 (13.2%) delivering within 280 days of Hurricane Harvey landfall. Women delivering after Hurricane Harvey were on average less likely to be obese and more likely to be older, Caucasian, married, have a household income higher than $75,000, a high school education, and private insurance. However, compared with the cohort of gravid patients who delivered before Hurricane Harvey, composite maternal morbidity increased by 27% (11.5% vs 14.7%, aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.14-1.42) after the storm. Composite neonatal morbidity increased by 50% (7.8% vs 11.9%, aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.34-1.71). In time series analyses, we observed a significant shift in composite maternal morbidity specific to women of low socioeconomic status (estimate 2.87, P=.028).

Objective To evaluate the effect of earthquake occurred on February 27, 2010 and perinatal outcomes of Chilean pregnant women, and to examine these effects by timing of exposure during pregnancy and newborn gender. Methods A register-based study was performed using data collected from women who had a vaginal delivery in a large private health center in Santiago, Chile, during 2009 and 2010. The study population was categorized according to exposure to earthquake and timing during gestation. Primary perinatal outcomes were gestational age at birth, birth weight, length and head circumference. Analyses adjusted for gender, gestational age at exposure, parity, maternal age and income. Results A total of 1,966 eligible vaginal deliveries occurred during 2009 and 2,110 in 2010. Birth weight was not affected by the trimester of exposure; however, length, head circumference and gestational age at birth were significantly different according to trimester of exposure and gender of newborn. In multivariable analysis, newborns were shorter by 2 mm, 5 mm and 4.5 mm, if they were exposed during their first, second and third trimester, respectively. Furthermore, newborns had a smaller head circumference by 1.2 mm and 1.5 mm if they were exposed during first and second trimester of gestation. Conclusion In this cohort, exposure to the February 2010 earthquake resulted in earlier delivery and reduced length and head circumference in the offspring.

This study aimed to quantify the association between exposure to ambient biomass-attributable PM2.5 and the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth across pregnancy windows in Sydney, Australia, from 2010 to 2020. We conducted case-control studies nested within a cohort of 578,391 singleton pregnancies, including 29,954 preterm births and 2,928 stillbirths. Controls were randomly selected using risk-set sampling. Daily all-source PM2.5 estimates at a 5 km resolution were obtained from a previous study. Days exceeding the 95th percentile of all-source PM2.5 at statistical area level 4 without significant dust storm pollution were classified as biomass-affected days. For these days, biomass-attributable PM2.5 was estimated using the remainder component from a seasonal trend decomposition, with the seasonal and trend components representing nonbiomass-attributable PM2.5. Conditional logistic regressions were used to analyze associations between biomass-attributable PM2.5 exposure and outcomes, adjusting for area-level socioeconomic factors, temperature, humidity, and temporal and seasonal trends. The odds ratio for preterm birth per interquartile range increase in biomass-attributable PM2.5 was 1.002 (95% CI = 0.997, 1.007) for the entire pregnancy average exposure, with similar null results across trimesters. For stillbirth, the odds ratio was 1.002 (95% CI = 0.985, 1.019) for the entire pregnancy average exposure, with comparable null findings across trimesters. These results suggest that in Sydney, biomass-attributable PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy may not increase the risk of preterm births or stillbirths.";"PM2.5; Biomass combustion; Biomass-attributable PM2.5; Wildfires; Wood heaters; Preterm birth; Stillbirth; Case-control design; LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; AIR-POLLUTION; HEALTH IMPACTS; ALL-CAUSE; MORTALITY; COHORT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

These wildfires burned approximately 23,794 hectares of forestland over several days. We investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to the by-products generated by wildfire disasters on birth weight. METHODS: Birth weight data were obtained for 1999-2001 from the birth registration database of the Korean National Statis-tical Office and matched with the zip code and exposed/unexposed pregnancy week for days of the wildfires. Generalized linear models were then used to assess the associations between birth weight and exposure to wildfires after adjusting for fetal sex, gestational age, parity, maternal age, maternal education, paternal education, and average exposed atmospheric temperature. RESULTS: Compared with unexposed pregnancies before and after the wildfires, mean birth weight decreased by 41.4 g (95% confidence interval [CI],-72.4 to-10.4) after wildfire exposure during the first trimester, 23.2 g (95% CI,-59.3 to 13.0) for expo-sure during the second trimester, and 27.0 g (95% CI,-63.8 to 9.8) during the third trimester. In the adjusted model for infants exposed in utero during any trimester, the mean birth weight decreased by 32.5 g (95% CI,-53.2 to-11.7). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a 1% reduction in birth weight after wildfire exposure. Thus, exposure to by-products gener-ated during a wildfire disaster during pregnancy may slow fetal growth and cause developmental delays.";"Birth weight; Prenatal exposure; Trimester; Wildfire; Disaster; Korea; CARBON-MONOXIDE; FIRE; TOXICITY; SMOKE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Earthquakes can cause acute distress, but can also contribute to chronic stress through long-term disruptions to social, economic and domestic circumstances. The aims of this study were to examine the direct effect of earthquake experiences on the birthweight of infants of women who experienced the 2015 Nepal Earthquakes during pregnancy and whether mental health mediated this relationship. Methods This is a prospective, population-based cohort study. Pregnant women in Bhaktapur District, Nepal who had experienced the 2015 earthquakes after conception were recruited. Baseline data were collected in structured individual interviews. Follow up was a short telephone interview two weeks after the baby's birth. Infant birthweight recorded on the hospital-issued birth certificate. The direct effect of earthquake experiences on birthweight and the indirect effect via antenatal common mental disorders (CMDs) were tested using Sobel tests simultaneously. Results In total 497/498 women contributed baseline data and 469 (94.4%) women also provided the birth weight of their infants. In total 6% of infants had low birth weight (< 2.5 kg). The earthquake experiences did not have a significant direct effect on birthweight (p = 0.116). However, the effect of earthquake experiences had a significant indirect effect on infant birthweight via CMDs. When 15 covariates were controlled, women who had moderate to severe earthquake experiences had an increase of 1.58 scores of antenatal CMD symptoms that resulted in their babies being 20.50 g lighter than those who had low earthquake experiences (p = 0.026). Conclusions The findings from this study indicate that the relationship is mediated by the mental health of women during pregnancy. Data demonstrate that the mental health of women who are pregnant should be prioritised in post-disaster management not only because of the burden experienced by women but also because of the risk for the growth and development of their babies.";"Birthweight; Earthquake experiences; Antenatal; Common mental disorders; INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; PRETERM BIRTH; MATERNAL STRESS; DISORDERS; OUTCOMES; WOMEN; RISK; DEPRESSION; PREVALENCE; COUNTRIES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

This association has been attributed to excess death of males in gestation and to reduced conception of males. We attempt to empirically discriminate between these two attributions by testing the hypotheses that the attacks of September 11, 2001 were followed in California first by higher fetal death sex ratios and later by lower sex ratios among very low weight births and total live births. METHODS: We apply interrupted time-series methods to the fetal death, very low birth weight, and secondary sex ratios. The methods control for trends, seasonal cycles, and other forms of autocorrelation that could induce spurious associations. RESULTS: Findings support the excess death explanation in that the fetal death sex ratio reached its highest level in the 6 year test period in October and November of 2001, while the very low weight birth sex ratio dropped to its lowest level in 14 years in December of 2001. The secondary sex ratio exhibited its second lowest value in 14 years in December of 2001. No support was found for the reduced conception explanation in that the sex ratio did not differ from expected values 9, 10 or 11 months after the attacks. CONCLUSIONS: We infer support for the excess death explanation at the expense of the reduced conception explanation.

We investigated this association in the prospective nationwide US Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Cohort, focusing on prenatal wildfire PM2.5 exposure intensity, duration, and timing. Methods In this cohort analysis, we included live singleton births recorded in the ECHO Cohort with available data on gestational age at birth and birthweight and dates of conception between Jan 1, 2006, and March 20, 2020. Census tract-level estimates of daily mean wildfire-derived PM2.5 for the years 2006-20 from a previous machine learning model were linked to residential address history. We calculated the mean concentration of daily wildfire PM2.5, days with wildfire PM2.5 (>0, >= 2.5, >= 5.0, and >= 10.0 mu g/m(3); termed smoke days) and consecutive smoke days (2, 3, or >= 4 days; termed smoke waves) above the prespecified concentration thresholds across pregnancy. Associations of cumlative pregnancy wildfire PM2.5 exposure with preterm birth (delivery before 37 weeks of gestation) were analysed by adjusted pooled logistic regression in the nationwide ECHO sample and in the US West census region. Associations between smoke days in gestational weeks 0-35 and preterm birth were evaluated by logistic regression in the national sample. Findings We included 20 034 births from 30 ECHO Cohort study sites, with residences during pregnancy in all 48 contiguous US states and the District of Columbia. 1687 (8.4%) of the 20 034 infants were preterm. The mean daily wildfire PM2.5 concentration during pregnancy was 0.36 mu g/m(3) (SD 0.46), with exposure to a mean of 22.2 smoke days (SD 16.6) of any wildfire PM2.5 concentration (>0 mu g/m(3)). Estimates of association between wildfire PM2.5 exposure metrics and preterm birth included the null in nationwide analyses; whereas, in the US West sample (N=5807), we estimated increased odds of preterm birth associated with mean daily wildfire PM2.5 (odds ratio [OR] 1.139 per 1-mu g/m3 increase [95% CI 1.001-1.296]), exposure to smoke days with a wildfire PM2.5 concentration of 5.0 mu g/m(3) or greater (OR 1.018 per additional smoke day [1.003-1.032]) and 10.0 mu g/m(3) or greater (OR 1.030 [1.006-1.054]), and exposure to >= 4-day smoke waves of 5.0 mu g/m(3) or greater (OR 1.185 per additional smoke wave [1.044-1.347]) and 10.0 mu g/m(3) or greater (OR 1.232 [1.029-1.475]). At the national level, by week of gestation, associations with preterm birth were observed in mid-pregnancy for smoke days with wildfire PM2.5 concentrations above 0 mu g/m3, of 2.5 mu g/m(3) or greater, and of 5.0 mu g/m(3) or greater, and in late pregnancy for smoke days of 10.0 mu g/m(3) or greater. Interpretation In a prospective cohort, we observed increased odds of preterm birth associated with wildfire PM2.5 exposure in the western USA, with findings suggesting an exposure-response relationship for increasing exposure intensity and duration. Preterm birth was also associated with exposure to smoke days in mid-to-late pregnancy at the national level. For practice and policy, these findings support the need for public health interventions aimed at reducing exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy.

A comprehensive review is urgently needed to summarize and update the evidence on the health effects of cyclones. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to provide a systematic review with meta-analysis of current evidence on the risks of all reported health outcomes related to cyclones and to identify research gaps and make recommendations for further research. METHODS: We systematically searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies in English published before 21 December 2022. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guide-lines, we developed inclusion criteria, screened the literature, and included epidemiological studies with a quantitative risk assessment of any mortality or morbidity-related outcomes associated with cyclone exposures. We extracted key data and assessed study quality for these studies and applied meta-analyses to quantify the overall effect estimate and the heterogeneity of comparable studies. RESULTS: In total, 71 studies from eight countries (the United States, China, India, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Australia, Brazil), mostly the United States, were included in the review. These studies investigated the all-cause and cause-specific mortality, as well as morbidity related to injury, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, mental disorders, adverse birth outcomes, cancer, diabetes, and other outcomes (e.g., suicide rates, gender-based violence). Studies mostly included only one high-amplitude cyclone (cyclones with a Saffir-Simpson category of 4 or 5, i.e., Hurricanes Katrina or Sandy) and focused on mental disorders morbidity and all-cause mortality and hospitalizations. Consistently elevated risks of overall mental health morbidity, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as all-cause mortality or hospitalizations, were found to be associated with cyclones. However, the results for other outcomes were generally mixed or limited. A statistically significant overall relative risk of 1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.13], 1.18 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.25), 1.15 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.18), 1.26 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.50) was observed for all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalizations, respiratory disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospitalizations, respectively, after cyclone exposures, whereas no statistically significant risks were identified for diabetes mortality, heart disease mortality, and preterm birth. High between-study heterogeneity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: There is generally consistent evidence supporting the notion that high-amplitude cyclones could significantly increase risks of mental disorders, especially for PTSD, as well as mortality and hospitalizations, but the evidence for other health outcomes, such as chronic diseases (e.g., CVDs, cancer, diabetes), and adverse birth outcomes remains limited or inconsistent.

During pregnancy, disruptions in homeostasis may increase the likelihood of preterm birth and preeclampsia. Expectant mothers traditionally have high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders, and many are susceptible to a variety of stressors during pregnancy. These common life stressors include financial concerns and relationship challenges and may be exacerbated by the biological, social, and psychological changes occurring during pregnancy. In addition, external stressors such as major weather events (eg, hurricanes, tornados, floods) and other global phenomena (eg, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) may contribute to stress during pregnancy. This review investigates recent literature published about the use of nonpharmacologic modalities for stress relief in pregnancy and examines the interplay between psychiatric diagnoses and stressors, with the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of implementing nonpharmacologic interventions as sole therapies or in conjunction with psychotherapy or psychiatric medication therapy. Further, the effectiveness of each nonpharmacologic therapy in reducing symptoms of maternal stress is reviewed. Mindfulness meditation and biofeedback have shown effectiveness in improving one's mental health, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety. Exercise, including yoga, may improve both depressive symptoms and birth outcomes. Expressive writing has successfully been applied postpartum and in response to pregnancy challenges.

Methods: Participants were interviewed regarding their hurricane experiences and perceived stress, and coping styles were assessed using the Brief COPE. Medical charts were also reviewed to obtain information about pregnancy outcomes. Logistic regression was performed to determine possible associations. Results: Hurricane exposure was significantly associated with induction of labor (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.03, 1.86], P =.03) and current perceived stress (aOR = 1.50, CI [1.34, 1.99], P <.01).

In order to investigate this relationship, data on every singleton birth in California 2006-2012 were combined with satellite-based estimates of wildfire smoke plume boundaries and high-resolution gridded estimates of surface PM2.5 concentrations and a regression model was used to estimate associations with preterm birth risk. Results suggest that each additional day of exposure to any wildfire smoke during pregnancy was associated with an 0.49 % (95 % CI: 0.41-0.59 %) increase in risk of preterm birth ( 37 weeks). At sample median smoke exposure (7 days) this translated to a 3.4 % increase in risk, relative to an unexposed mother. Estimates by trimester suggest stronger associations with exposure later in pregnancy and estimates by smoke intensity indicate that observed associations were driven by higher intensity smoke-days. Exposure to low intensity smoke-days had no association with preterm birth while an additional medium (smoke PM2.5 5-10 mu g/m(3)) or high (smoke PM2.5 10 mu g/m(3)) intensity smoke-day was associated with an 0.95 % (95 % CI: 0.47-1.42 %) and 0.82 % (95 % CI: 0.41-1.24 %) increase in preterm risk, respectively. In contrast to previous findings for other pollution types, neither exposure to smoke nor the relative impact of smoke on preterm birth differed by race/ethnicity or income in our sample. However, impacts differed greatly by baseline smoke exposure, with mothers in regions with infrequent smoke exposure experiencing substantially larger impacts from an additional smoke-day than mothers in regions where smoke is more common. We estimate 6,974 (95 % CI: 5,513-8,437) excess preterm births attributable to wildfire smoke exposure 2007-2012, accounting for 3.7 % of observed preterm births during this period.

We extend the previous literature by comparing the impact of the initial unexpected earthquake to the impacts of thousands of aftershocks that occurred in the same region over the 18 months following the initial earthquake. We find that exposure to these earthquakes reduced gestational age, increased the likelihood of having a late birth, and negatively affected newborn health-with the largest effects for earthquakes that occurred in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy.

This systematic review aims to synthesise the existing literature exploring the relationship between maternal exposure to short-to medium-term changes in outdoor air quality and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed articles using PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, ProQuest, GreenFILE and Scopus was conducted in January 2018 using selected search terms. Quality of included studies were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Results: Eleven studies were included; eight assessed the impact of maternal exposure to air pollution exacerbation events, such as wildfires, oil well fires and volcanic eruptions, and three assessed the impact of improvement events, such as the 2018 Beijing Olympics and closure of industrial activities, on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Studies were highly heterogenous in methodology. Six studies found a significant association between acute changes in air quality and markers of fetal growth restriction, while two did not. Three studies found an adverse association between acute changes in air quality and markers of gestational maturity, and one did not. Conclusion: Overall, there is some evidence that maternal exposure to acute changes in air quality of short-to medium-term duration increases the risk of fetal growth restriction and preterm birth.

Few studies simultaneously evaluated exposures to these increasingly common exposures. Objectives: We investigated the relationship between exposure to heat and wildfire smoke and preterm birth (PTB). Methods: In this time-stratified case-crossover study, participants consisted of 85,806 California singleton PTBs (20-36 gestational weeks) from May through October of 2015-2019. Birthing parent ZIP codes were linked to high-resolution daily weather, PM2.5 from wildfire smoke, and ambient air pollution data. Heat day was defined as a day with apparent temperature >98th percentile within each ZIP code and heat wave was defined as >= 2 consecutive heat days. Wildfire-smoke day was defined as a day with any exposure to wildfire-smoke PM2.5. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing exposures during a hazard period (lags 0-6) compared to control periods. Analyses were adjusted for relative humidity, fine particles, and ozone. Results: Wildfire-smoke days were associated with 3.0% increased odds of PTB (ORlag0: 1.03, CI: 1.00-1.05). Compared with white participants, associations appeared stronger among Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indians/Alaskan Native participants. Heatwave days (ORlag2: 1.07, CI: 1.02-1.13) were positively associated with PTB, with stronger associations among those simultaneously exposed to wildfire smoke days (ORlag2: 1.19, CI: 1.11-1.27). Similar findings were observed for heat days and when other temperature metrics (e.g., maximum, minimum) were used. Discussion: Heat and wildfire increased PTB risk with evidence of synergism.

Previous research suggests that short-term hospital admissions for respiratory outcomes increased specifically as a result of these fires. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the impact of a wildfire event during pregnancy on birth weight among term infants. METHODS: Using records for singleton term births delivered to mothers residing in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) during 2001-2005 (n = 886,034), we compared birth weights from pregnancies that took place entirely before or after the wildfire event (n = 747,590) with those where wildfires occurred during the first (n = 60,270), second (n = 39,435), or third (n = 38,739) trimester. The trimester-specific effects of wildfire exposure were estimated using a fixed-effects regression model with several maternal characteristics included as covariates. RESULTS: Compared with pregnancies before and after the wildfires, mean birth weight was estimated to be 7.0 g lower [95% confidence interval (CI): -11.8, -2.2] when the wildfire occurred during the third trimester, 9.7 g lower when it occurred during the second trimester (95% Cl: -14.5, -4.8), and 3.3 g lower when it occurred during the first trimester (95% Cl: -7.2, 0.6).

The challenges that nurses faced during the 6 days after the disaster were arduous and multifaceted. Nurses had no choice but to be creative and flexible and improvise by using what limited resources were available. Nurses were not able to provide care in the typical patient care environment because patients were relocated to multiple areas of the hospital, the ER ramp, and the parking garage to await evacuation. The temperature soared to 110 degrees F, and evacuation efforts were chaotic and disorganized.

To date, there is no published literature available on the experiences of pregnant women in the USVI exposed to these hurricanes. Understanding how hurricanes affect pregnant women is key to developing and executing targeted hurricane preparedness and response policies. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of pregnancy and birth among women in the USVI exposed to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Methods: We employed a qualitative descriptive methodology to guide sampling, data collection, and analysis. Semi-structured interviews of 30-60 min in length were conducted with a purposive sample of women (N = 18) in the USVI who were pregnant during or became pregnant within two months after the hurricanes. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and data managed in MAXQDA. Team members developed a codebook, applied codes for content, and reconciled discrepancies. We thematically categorized text according to a socioecological conceptual framework of risk and resilience for maternal-neonatal health following hurricane exposure. Results: Women's experiences were organized into two main categories (risk and resilience). We identified the following themes related to risk at 3 socioecological levels including: (1) individual: changes in food access (We had to go without) and stress (I was supposed to be relaxing); (2) household/community: diminished psychosocial support (Everyone was dealing with their own things) and the presence of physical/environmental hazards (I was really scared); and (3) maternity system: compromised care capacity (The hospital was condemned). The themes related to resilience included: (1) individual: personal coping strategies (Being calm); (2) household/community: mutual psychosocial and tangible support (We shared our resources); and (3) the maternity system: continuity of high-quality care (On top of their game). Conclusions: A socioecological approach provides a useful framework to understand how risk and resilience influence the experience of maternal hurricane exposure. As the frequency of the most intense hurricanes is expected to increase, clinicians, governments, and health systems should work collaboratively to implement hurricane preparedness and response plans that address pregnant women's unique needs and promote optimal maternal-infant health.";"Cyclone; Disaster; Pregnancy; Pregnancy outcome; Resilience; Risk; US Virgin Islands; DISASTER RECOVERY; BIRTH OUTCOMES; EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS; MATERNAL EXPOSURE; RESILIENCE; INTERVIEWS; STRESS; RECALL; PLACE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

We calculated the spontaneous and induced abortion rate for 2011-2016 using two different methods (cross-sectional and longitudinal). We calculated the quartiles and outliers to determine the impact and duration of the GEJE. Periodicity was investigated using spectral density analysis.

Contrarily, the monthly analysis in the cross-sectional method, revealed specific increases in induced abortion rate during the year after the GEJE; in the longitudinal method, induced abortions increased among women who became pregnant within 1 year after the GEJE. Spontaneous abortion showed no specific periodicity, while induced abortion showed cycles of 6 and 12 months, with a particular increase in May each year.Conclusions: The spontaneous abortion rate was not affected by the GEJE.

However, the impact of TCs on pregnant women, a vulnerable population, remains largely unknown. We aimed to estimate the association between prenatal exposure to TCs and risk of preterm birth in the eastern United States (US) and to assess whether the association varies by individual- and area-level characteristics. Methods: We included data on 19,529,748 spontaneous singleton births from 1989 to 2002 across 378 US counties. In each county, we classified days as exposed to a TC when TC-associated peak sustained winds at the county's population-weighted center were > 17.2 m/s (gale-force winds or greater). We defined preterm birth as births delivered prior to 37 completed weeks of gestation. We used distributed lag log-linear mixed-effects models to estimate the relative risk (RR) and absolute risk difference (ARD) for TC exposure by comparing preterm births occurring in TC-periods (from 2 days before to 30 days after the TC's closest approach to the county's population center) to matched non-TC periods. We conducted secondary analyses using other wind thresholds (12 m/s and 22 m/s) and other exposure metrics: county distance to storm track (30 km, 60 km, and 100 km) and cumulative rainfall within the county (75 mm, 100 mm, and 125 mm). Results: During the study period, there were 1,981,797 (10.1%) preterm births and 58 TCs that affected at least one US county on which we had birth data. The risk of preterm birth was positively associated with TC exposure defined as peak sustained wind speed > 17.2 m/s (gale-force winds or greater) [RR: 1.01 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.03); ARD: 9 (95% CI: -7, 25) per 10,000 pregnancies], distance to storm track < 60 km [RR: 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.04); ARD: 23 (95% CI: 9, 38) per 10,000 pregnancies], and cumulative rainfall > 100 mm [RR: 1.04 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.06); ARD: 36 (95% CI: 16, 56) per 10,000 pregnancies]. Results were comparable when considering other wind, distance, or rain thresholds. The association was more pronounced among early preterm births and mothers living in more socially vulnerable counties but did not vary across strata of other hypothesized risk factors. Conclusions: Maternal exposure to TC was associated with a higher risk of preterm birth.

It is unclear to what extent PNMS influences obesity risk independent of its impact on birth characteristics, especially among humans. Our objective was to determine whether PNMS resulting from a natural disaster influenced risk of childhood obesity. RESULTS: Eight children with high objective PNMS exposure (14.5%) were obese compared to one child (1.8%) with low exposure (P = 0.02). Objective PNMS increased obesity risk (model 1, P = 0.02, odds ratio = 1.37) after controlling for other potential risk factors. DISCUSSION: Results suggest that PNMS might be an independent risk factor in the development of childhood obesity. METHODS: Participants included 111 women who were pregnant during the January 1998 Quebec Ice Storm or who conceived within the following 3 months and their children. We tested associations between objective and subjective PNMS from the storm and childhood obesity status at age 51/2, controlling for children's birth characteristics and breastfeeding status; household socioeconomic status; maternal obstetric complications, life events and smoking during pregnancy, psychological functioning, and height (model 1, n = 111) or BMI (for a subset of 69 participants, model 2).";"PITUITARY-ADRENAL-AXIS; MATERNAL STRESS; HEALTH OUTCOMES; LIPID PROFILES; BIRTH-WEIGHT; LIFE; FAMINE; GROWTH; AGE; IMPACT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

In September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the archipelago, which caused: collapse of the electrical system, collapse of the communication system, limited access to clean water, food, gas, and health services, destruction of public (e.g., hospitals) and private property (e.g., houses) and more than 4500 deaths. Pregnant and postpartum individuals are especially vulnerable to natural disasters. They face difficulty obtaining adequate pre- and post-natal care, are exposed to increased risk of miscarriage, premature delivery, and giving birth to low birth weight babies during and after disasters and are also more likely to suffer physical and mental health problems compared to the general population during and after disasters. A face-to-face questionnaire was administered to PROTECT participants who were pregnant during hurricanes Irma or Maria or who became pregnant shortly after in order to identify hurricane-related sources of stress and other adverse effects. This paper is based on the answers to the open-ended question at the end of the questionnaire where participants were asked to share their experiences during and after the hurricanes. Among the 375 participants who completed the survey, 76 answers to the open-ended question were considered due to data saturation. The answers to the open-ended question were transcribed into a document in order to facilitate the coding process. The transcribed text was analyzed first to identify emerging categories and then coded to identify common themes as well as divergence among participants. The following themes were identified: pregnancy and birth challenges, lack of access to basic services, housing conditions, stressful working conditions, concerns about health, concerns about their children, and positive or protective aspects. The results indicate how the disruption in access to basic services has a unique impact on the physical and mental health of pregnant and post-partum women in an emergency situation. These findings point to the potential benefit of developing specific protocols designed for emergency preparedness aimed at this population, which can inform healthcare providers and community organizations in case of future events.";"maternal health; emergencies; hurricanes; Puerto Rico; EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS; WOMEN";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

We find that women who were exposed to drought conditions during their early childhood are significantly less wealthy as adults. These effects are confined to women born and raised in rural households, indicating that the impacts of rainfall are felt via changes in agricultural output. In addition to lower levels of wealth, women who experience droughts in infancy also receive fewer years of formal education and, in the case of extreme drought conditions, have reduced adult heights. Our results also suggest that drought exposure in infancy can have long-term, negative impacts on women's empowerment. Finally, we also show that these impacts may be transmitted to the women's offspring, with children of affected women more likely to be born at a low birth weight (weighing <2.5 kg). To our knowledge, this represents the largest study to date both geographically and over time showing a strong relationship between early life rainfall conditions and adult outcomes, and the first to show that the impacts could span generations.

Individuals and institutions should have mechanisms in place to initiate the prompt administration of medication when a patient presents with a hypertensive emergency. Treatment with first-line agents should be expeditious and occur as soon as possible within 30-60 minutes of confirmed severe hypertension to reduce the risk of maternal stroke. Intravenous labetalol and hydralazine have long been considered first-line medications for the management of acute-onset, severe hypertension in pregnant women and women in the postpartum period. Although relatively less information currently exists for the use of calcium channel blockers for this clinical indication, the available evidence suggests that immediate release oral nifedipine also may be considered as a first-line therapy, particularly when intravenous access is not available.

We used administrative data on birth records and reports on the Mariana Tragedy to identify all births from newborns exposed in utero and the intensity of that exposure, according to the mother's municipality of residence. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we estimated the impact of different intensities of exposure on birth outcomes. We found that being directly exposed in utero to the Tragedy resulted in 1.86 days shorter gestational age and 2.6 percentage points higher incidence of preterm birth ( < 37 weeks). We found no impact on birth-weight related outcomes. The effect is larger than previously identified for other catastrophic events.

Four tenets of psychoanalytic theory-the unborn child experienced as solely a fantasy, mother's symbolic equation of her child primarily with the penis, unconscious causation of perinatal loss, and the ubiquity of unconscious ambivalence underlying parental guilt-are all critically evaluated and revised to introduce a contemporary psychoanalytic understanding of perinatal loss.

Methods: In this health care setting in Kathmandu, Nepal routine blood culture is performed on all febrile patients with a temperature >38 degrees C or when there is clinical suspicion of bacteremia. During 2015 we atypically isolated and identified several Serratia spp. We extracted clinical data from these cases and performed whole genome sequencing on all isolates using a MiSeq system (Ilumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Results: Between June and November 2015, we identified eight patients with suspected bacteremia that produced a positive blood culture for Serratia spp., six Serratia rubidaea and five Serratia marcescens. The S. rubidaea were isolated from three neonates and were concentrated in the neonatal intensive care unit between June and July 2015. ALL patients were severely ill and one patient died. Whole genome sequencing confirmed that six Nepalese S. rubidaea sequences were identical and indicative of a single-source outbreak. Conclusions: Despite extensive screening we were unable to identify the source of the outbreak, but the inferred timeline suggested that these atypical infections were associated with the aftermath of two massive earthquakes.

Features unique to the obstetric population (including antepartum, intrapartum, postpartum and neonatal care) warrant special consideration in the event of a disaster. Pregnancy increases the risks of untoward outcomes from various infectious diseases. Trauma during pregnancy presents anatomic and physiologic considerations that often can require increased use of resources such as higher rates of cesarean delivery. Recent evidence suggests that floods and human-influenced environmental disasters increase the risks of spontaneous miscarriages, preterm births, and low-birth-weight infants among pregnant women. The potential surge in maternal and neonatal patient volume due to mass-casualty events, transfer of high-acuity patients, or redirection of patients because of geographic barriers presents unique challenges for obstetric care facilities. These circumstances require that facilities plan for additional increases in necessary resources and staffing. Although emergencies may be unexpected, hospitals and obstetric delivery units can prepare to implement plans that will best serve maternal and pediatric care needs when disasters occur. Clear designation of levels of maternal and neonatal care facilities, along with establishment of a regional network incorporating hospitals that provide maternity services and those that do not, will enable rapid transport of obstetric patients to the appropriate facilities, ensuring the right care at the right time.

We included climate change-related studies involving children aged 0-5 worldwide. Covidence facilitated a rigorous screening process, and we conducted a critical appraisal. Two independent reviewers handled screening and data extraction. Eligible studies underwent coding and extraction using Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (EPPI) reviewer software. The EGM was constructed using EPPI Mapper, and comprehensive findings were presented through live links and figures.Result We identified 196 studies, comprising 59.2% children and 40.8% neonates, with diverse research approaches, including 94% quantitative studies. There has been a notable increase in research publications over the past 5 years. Evidence is heavily concentrated in Asia (93 studies) and Africa (47 studies). The most frequently studied exposures are those related to extreme climate events, followed by drought and floods. However, there are gaps in the study of extreme cold and storms. The significant outcomes comprised preterm birth (55 studies), low birth weight (27 studies), malnutrition (59 studies) and diarrhoeal diseases (28 studies). Evidence on mental health problems and congenital disabilities receives relatively less attention.Conclusion This EGM is crucial for researchers, policymakers and practitioners. It highlights knowledge gaps and guides future research to address the evolving threats of climate change to global child health.Trial registration number INPLASY202370086";"Child Health; Infant; Neonatology; Mortality; Epidemiology; HEALTH; STRATEGIES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

We found consistent results with wildfire smoke exposure in the second trimester and increased continuous birthweight-for-gestational age z-score. Differences by infant sex were not consistent. Counter to our hypothesis, results suggest that wildfire smoke exposures are associated with increased risk for higher birthweight. We observed strongest associations during the second trimester. These investigations should be expanded to other populations exposed to wildfire smoke and aim to identify vulnerable communities. Additional research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms in this relationship between wildfire smoke exposure and adverse birth outcomes.";"wildfires; PM2.5; pregnancy; birth weight; fetal growth; AMBIENT PM2.5; PREGNANCY; SEX";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

In this article, the key literature including data supporting this hypothesis is reviewed. A simple numerical model, based on a competition between the driving and resisting forces for fetal membrane rupture, is presented. This model provides a quantitative mechanism for membrane failure in the context of storms with low atmospheric pressure.

The ever-increasing range of biocompatible nanoparticle formulations available is now making it possible to selectively deliver drugs to uterine and placental tissues and dramatically limit fetal drug transfer. Formulations that are refractory to placental uptake offer the possibility of retaining drugs within the maternal circulation, allowing pregnant individuals to take medicines previously considered too harmful to the developing baby. Liposomes, ionizable lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, and adenoviral vectors have all been used to create efficacious drug delivery systems for use in pregnancy, although each approach offers distinct advantages and limitations.

Reducing maternal mortality and morbidity is currently the main targets of the UN's Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3. The purpose of this study was to develop an intervention package called RHCC (Reproductive Health Kit 8; Capacity building; Community awareness), and to implement and evaluate it in three primary health-care (PHC) facilities in Belkuchi, Bangladesh, in order to improve the quality and availability of post-abortion care (PAC) during the 2017 floods. Design/methodology/approach This research used both quantitative and qualitative methods to develop, implement and assess the RHCC in three flood-prone PHC facilities in Belkuchi. Findings The RHCC was implemented during the floods of 2017. The findings pre- and post-intervention suggest it led to an increase in skilled management among health workers, an increase in the quality of care for clients and the availability of PAC at three PHC facilities during floods. Originality/value Due to its geographic location, Bangladesh is exposed to recurrent floods and cyclones. Evidence-based integrated intervention packages, such as the RHCC, can improve the quality and availability of reproductive health care during disasters at PHC level and, in doing so, can promote the UN's agenda on ""disaster resilient health system"" to achieve the SDG 3, and the WHO's campaign on universal health coverage.";"Bangladesh; Flood; Sendai framework; Universal health coverage; SDG; Sexual and reproductive health; PHC; Post-abortion care; MENSTRUAL REGULATION; SERVICES; CALL";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

A growing body of evidence demonstrated associations between air pollution exposure during pregnancy and birth defects. To date, there is no study looking at birth defects and exposure to wildfire-related air pollution, which is suggested as a type of air pollution source with high toxicity for reproductive health. Objective Our study addresses this gap by examining the association between birth defects and wildfire smoke exposure in Brazil between 2001 and 2018. Based on known differences of impacts of wildfires across different regions of Brazil, we hypothesized differences in risks of birth defects for different regions. Methods We used a logistic regression model to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for individual birth defects (12 categories) associated with wildfire exposure during each trimester of pregnancy. Results Among the 16,825,497 birth records in our study population, there were a total of 7595 infants born in Brazil between 2001 and 2018 with birth defects in any of the selected categories. After adjusting for several confounders in the primary analysis, we found statistically significant OR for three birth defects, including cleft lip/cleft palate [OR: 1.007 (95% CI: 1.001; 1.013)] during the second trimester of exposure, congenital anomalies of the respiratory system [OR: 1.013 (95% CI: 1.002; 1.023)] in the second trimester of exposure, and congenital anomalies of the nervous system [OR: 1.002 (95% CI: 1.001; 1.003)] during the first trimester of exposure for the regions South, North, and Midwest, respectively. Significance Our results suggest that maternal exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of an infant being born with some congenital anomaly. Considering that birth defects are associated with long-term disability, impacting families and the healthcare system (e.g., healthcare costs), our findings should be of great concern to the public health community. Impact statement Our study focused on the association between maternal exposure to wildfire smoke in Brazil during pregnancy and the risk of an infant being born with congenital anomalies, which presents serious public health and environmental challenges.";"Wildfire; Smoke; Air pollution; Birth defects; Pregnancy; MATERNAL EXPOSURE; PREGNANCY OUTCOMES; MORTALITY; QUALITY; IMPACTS; GROWTH; COHORT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The purpose is twofold: (i) to capture disaggregated vulnerability variations normally obscured by national statistics, thereby providing more nuanced insights into Vietnam's vulnerability to natural disasters; and (ii) to take advantage of the fact that the overall political system and key institutional structures to a large extent are constant across Vietnam's provinces, which makes the analysis a novel addition to the many disaster studies based on cross-national variations. The paper's analysis indicates that much of Vietnam's cross-provincial variations in natural disaster fatalities and economic costs can be explained by differences in key socioeconomic factors. High provincial rates of inequality, poverty and infant mortality, for instance, appear to drive up natural disaster fatalities.

Studies in humans and animals convincingly demonstrate that environmental perturbations in utero may permanently change organ structure and metabolism and/or alter homeostatic regulatory mechanisms among the offspring. These programmed changes may be the origins of adult diseases, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. Throughout evolution and development, humans and animals have been exposed to two common environmental stresses, drought and famine. Notably, drought-induced water deprivation is associated with dehydration anorexia and thus a concomitant potential nutrient stress. Our laboratory has performed studies among pregnant rat and sheep in which we simulate drought conditions via maternal dehydration and famine conditions via nutrient restriction. Maternal dehydration results in low-birth-weight offspring, which demonstrate gender-specific plasma hypernatremia and hypertonicity and arterial hypertension. Gestational nutrient restriction also resulted in low-birth-weight offspring. If permitted rapid catch-up growth by nutrient availability, these offspring demonstrate evidence of increased body weight and body fat, and leptin resistance as adults. Conversely, if the catch-up growth is delayed by nutrition restriction, the offspring exhibit normal body weight, body fat, and plasma leptin levels as adults. These studies indicate that osmoregulatory and cardiovascular homeostasis and phenotypic predisposition to obesity may be programmed in utero.

Objectives: Our goal was to determine how timing and severity of exposure during pregnancy to objective and subjective stress due to a natural disaster influenced gestation length and fetal growth patterns. Methods: We assessed objective and subjective PNMS levels among 172 women exposed to an ice storm during or shortly before pregnancy. We analyzed associations between PNMS levels and outcomes (gestation length, birth weight, birth length, head circumference, and growth ratios), controlling for other variables such as age, obstetric complications, socioeconomic status, and trait anxiety. Results: Gestation lengths and predicted birth weights were shorter among participants exposed to the ice storm during early to mid pregnancy, compared to 3 rd trimester and pre-pregnancy exposure. Birth lengths were shorter in the sample compared to population references, and predicted values were shorter among participants with a ""discrepancy"" between their objective and subjective PNMS levels. High objective PNMS levels predicted smaller head circumferences in early pregnancy, but we also observed patterns in predicted values of head circumference to birth length ratios suggesting the sparing of brain development relative to birth length among boys in early pregnancy. These sparing effects decreased in later pregnancy. Conclusions: Exposure to stressful events during pregnancy influences birth outcomes independently of other factors. Exposure timing, newborn sex, and the type of stressor influence the effects observed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the current evidence is scarce, inconsistent, and has knowledge gaps. This study aims to estimate the associations of flood exposure before and during pregnancy with adverse birth outcomes and to identify susceptible exposure windows and effect modifiers. Methods In this cohort study, we obtained all the birth records occurring in Greater Sydney, Australia, from Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2020, from the New South Wales Midwives Data Collection and in the Brisbane metropolitan region, Australia, from Jan 1, 1995, to Dec 31, 2014, from the Queensland Health Perinatal Data Collection. For each birth, residential address and historical flood information from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory were used to estimate the numbers of days with floods during five exposure windows (Pre-1 was defined as 13-24 weeks before the last menstrual period [LMP], Pre-2 was 0-12 weeks before the LMP, trimester 1 [Tri-1] was 0-12 weeks after the LMP, trimester 2 [Tri-2] was 13-28 weeks after the LMP, and trimester 3 [Tri-3] was >= 29 weeks after the LMP). We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) of adverse birth outcomes (preterm births, stillbirths, term low birthweight [TLBW], and small for gestational age [SGA]) associated with flood exposures in the five exposure windows using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Findings 1 338 314 birth records were included in our analyses, which included 91 851 (6<middle dot>9%) preterm births, 9831 (0<middle dot>7%) stillbirths, 25 567 (1<middle dot>9%) TLBW, and 108 658 (8<middle dot>1%) SGA. Flood exposure in Pre-1 was associated with increased risks of TLBW (HR 1<middle dot>06 [95% CI 1<middle dot>01-1<middle dot>12]) and SGA (1<middle dot>04 [1<middle dot>01-1<middle dot>06]); flood exposure during Tri-1 was associated with increased risks of preterm births (1<middle dot>03 [1<middle dot>002-1<middle dot>05]), stillbirth (1<middle dot>11 [1<middle dot>03-1<middle dot>20]), and SGA (1<middle dot>03 [1<middle dot>01-1<middle dot>06]). In contrast, flood exposures during Pre-2 and Tri-3 were associated with reduced risks. Interpretation Exposures to floods in Pre-1 and Tri-1 are both associated with increased risks of adverse birth outcomes, and the risks increase with a higher exposure. Upon planning for conception and prenatal care, individuals and health practitioners should raise awareness of the increased risks of adverse birth outcomes after experiencing floods.

METHODS: Case-control study, carried out with live births at the Municipal Hospital of Governador Valadares, from May 2017 to July 2018. The case group consisted of full-term live births and low birthweight, and the control group consisted of full-term live births with adequate weight, matched by gender and date of birth. For each case, two controls were selected. Data collection was performed through interviews with the puerperal women, and complementary information was obtained by analyzing the prenatal card and medical records. For data analysis, logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: The study included 65 live births from the case group and 130 from the control group. After the analysis was adjusted for other factors under study, we found that the higher risks of low birthweight are associated with the first childbirth (OR = 2.033; 95%CI = 1.047-3.948; p = 0.036), smoking during pregnancy (OR = 2.850; 95%CI = 1.013-8.021; p = 0.047) and consumption of water supplied by the municipalities affected by the tailings from the Fundao dam failure (RC = 2.444; 95%CI = 1.203-4.965; p = 0.013).

Presently, India is facing a dual burden of natural disasters and malnutrition, especially in the vulnerable regions that are exposed to floods. Many studies have been focused on micro-level or regional-level analyses. The present study is uniquely examining the association between flood exposure and malnutrition at a national scale. The study investigated the impacts of flood exposure on childhood malnutrition, using the Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure (CIAF) to assess stunting, wasting, and underweight among children under five years age group. The present study is based on the analyses of data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5, 2019-2021) and Central Water Commission (CWC) reports. The data were analyzed across flood-affected regions in India and categorized by the frequency of flood events (i.e., non-flooded; 1-2 times flooded; and three times flooded events). The analysis reveals a significant increase in malnutrition rates with higher flood exposure in regions experiencing three flood events, 38 percent of children were stunted, 20 percent were wasted, and 35.7 percent were underweight as compared to non-flooded areas. Factors such as low birth weight, maternal education, sanitation facilities, and household infrastructure intensified malnutrition outcomes. The major findings of the study suggested that repeated flooding events aggravate food insecurity and increase vulnerability to child malnutrition. This study not only highlights the compounded effects of flood exposure and socio-economic disparities on CIAF malnutrition but also offers policy-relevant insights. The results of the study highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions, including developing disaster-resilient infrastructure, educational programs for mothers, and enhanced access to sanitation and healthcare in flood-affected regions in India.";"Flood; CIAF; Malnutrition; Stunting; Maternal education; India; HEALTH OUTCOMES; AFFECTED AREAS; GLOBAL HEALTH; CHILDREN; UNDERNUTRITION; BANGLADESH; NUTRITION; INEQUALITY; PAKISTAN; POVERTY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

In this study the Christchurch earthquake was utilised as a model of maternal stress to assess its effects on PTB rates and other pregnancy outcomes. Aim To investigate whether women who experienced a major earthquake during the first trimester of pregnancy were at an altered risk of PTB compared to women who did not experience an earthquake during their pregnancy. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study. Women carrying a singleton pregnancy in their first trimester on 22 February, 2011 were identified for a post-earthquake cohort (n = 1057). A group of women pregnant in 2009 were identified for a pre-earthquake cohort (n = 1314). Data were obtained from electronic medical records and the hospital clinical coding database. Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to analyse differences in pregnancy outcomes. Statistically significant variables together with earthquake exposure were assessed as risk factors for PTB using a multivariate logistic regression model.

This special issue summarizes the results and current status of the FHMS and discusses the challenges and future directions of the FHMS. The FHMS, a cohort study of all people who were residents in Fukushima Prefecture at the time of the accident, consists of a Basic Survey, Thyroid Ultrasound Examination, Comprehensive Health Check, Mental Health and Lifestyle Survey, and Pregnancy and Birth Survey. The radiation exposure was estimated based on the behavioral records examined using the Basic Survey. Although the response rate was low in the Basic Survey, the representativeness of the radiation exposure data was confirmed using additional surveys. There appears to be no relationship between the radiation exposure and risk of thyroid cancer, although more thyroid cancer cases were detected than initially expected. The ongoing Comprehensive Health Check and Mental Health and Lifestyle Survey have provided evidence of worsening physical and mental health status. The Pregnancy and Birth Survey showed rates of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and congenital abnormalities similar to the national average. Considering the above evidence, the Fukushima Prefectural Government decided to end the Pregnancy and Birth Survey at the end of March 2021, as recommended by the Prefectural Oversight Committee. The framework of the FHMS has not changed, but the FHMS needs to adapt according to the survey results and the changing needs of the eligible residents and municipalities.";"protocol; cohort study; radiation; disaster; thyroid gland; EAST JAPAN EARTHQUAKE; NUCLEAR DISASTER; RISK-FACTORS; DRINKING; EVACUEES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Shortand long-term exposures to air pollutants are known contributors to health outcomes; however, the potential for developmental health effects of air pollution exposures during gestation or earlychildhood have yet to be reviewed and synthesized from a DOHaD lens. The objective of this study is to summarize the literature on cardiovascular and metabolic, respiratory, allergic, and neuropsychological health outcomes, from prenatal development through early childhood, associated with early-life exposures to outdoor air pollutants, including traffic-related and wildfire-generated air pollutants. (2) Methods: We conducted a search using PubMed and the references of articles previously known to the authors. We selected papers that investigated health outcomes during fetal or childhood development in association with early-life ambient or source-specific air pollution exposure. (3) Results: The current literature reports that prenatal and early-childhood exposures to ambient and traffic-related air pollutants are associated with a range of adverse outcomes in early life, including cardiovascular and metabolic, respiratory and allergic, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Very few studies have investigated associations between wildfire-related air pollution exposure and health outcomes during prenatal, postnatal, or childhood development.

The terrorist explosions of the World Trade Center in New York City and the other events on the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania on 11 September 2001 were stressful events that affected people around the world. Pregnant women and their offspring are especially vulnerable during and after such a terrorist attack. The objective was to systematically review the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes after the terrorist attacks on Sept 11, 2001. Methods. The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) criteria were used for reporting of this review. Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.0. Results. Ten reports of low-to-moderate risk of methodological bias were included. There was increased risks of infants with birthweight of 1,500 g-1,999 g (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.67 [95%CI 1.11-2.52]) and small-for-gestational age births (AOR 1.90; 95%CI 1.05-3.46) in New York. There was increased risks of low birthweight (relative risk 2.25; 95%CI 1.29-3.90) and preterm births (relative risk 1.50; 95%CI 1.06-2.14) among ethnically Arabic women living in California There was a reduction in birthweight by 276 g and in head circumference by 1 cm when DNA adducts, a marker for environmental toxin exposure, were doubled in maternal blood. In Holland, a 48-g reduction in birthweight was reported. Conclusions. The World Trade Center disaster influenced pregnancy outcomes in New York, among ethnically Arab women living in California and among Dutch women.

In the present analysis, we sought to examine common risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse birth outcomes which have not been characterized previously in this unique population. Pregnant women from the PROTECT cohort are recruited from the heavily contaminated Northern coast of the island of Puerto Rico and are free of pre-existing conditions like diabetes.

Wildfire activity is intensifying in Latin America due to climate and land-use changes, but the health impacts of wildfire-derived PM2.5 in urban areas remain poorly quantified and recognized. Objective. To assess the evidence on wildfire-related PM2.5 and its association with mortality and morbidity in Latin American cities. Materials and methods. We conducted a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines, using data from PubMed, Scopus, and Bireme. One reviewer independently screened 163 articles and extracted data from 14 eligible studies. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results. Most studies were conducted in Brazil (n = 12) and used time-series or modelling designs to estimate health risks. Wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure was associated with all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Reported effect estimates ranged from 1.7 to 7.7% increases in risk per 10 mu g/m3 of exposure. Other studies assessed preterm birth, COVID-19 outcomes, and site-specific cancers. While two studies provided harmonized RR estimates for all-cause mortality, high heterogeneity and methodological differences prevented formal meta-analysis. Conclusion. Wildfire smoke contributes measurably to premature mortality in Latin America, but current evidence is unevenly distributed across regions, time periods, and population subgroups. Studies rarely capture the disproportionate risks faced by indigenous and rural communities or the intraurban disparities linked to poverty and geography. Future research should focus on the health burden of morbidity linked to wildfire PM2.5.";"wildfires; climate change; particulate matter; mortality; morbidity; Latin America; BRAZIL; RISK";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Log-binomial regression and semi-parametric linear regression were used, controlling for maternal and ZIP code tabulation area characteristics.

Objectives: We aimed to assess the evidence of health effects from exposure to wildfire smoke and to identify susceptible populations. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature for studies of wildfire smoke exposure on mortality and on respiratory, cardiovascular, mental, and perinatal health. Within those reviewed papers deemed to have minimal risk of bias, we assessed the coherence and consistency of findings. Discussion: Consistent evidence documents associations between wildfire smoke exposure and general respiratory health effects, specifically exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Growing evidence suggests associations with increased risk of respiratory infections and all-cause mortality. Evidence for cardiovascular effects is mixed, but a few recent studies have reported associations for specific cardiovascular end points. Insufficient research exists to identify specific population subgroups that are more susceptible to wildfire smoke exposure. Conclusions: Consistent evidence from a large number of studies indicates that wildfire smoke exposure is associated with respiratory morbidity with growing evidence supporting an association with all-cause mortality.

Results Between 2007 and 2010, 844,348 (40%) births were exposed to wildfire in California. Compared with births without wildfire exposure, those with first-trimester exposure were associated with higher rates of gastroschisis, 7.8 vs. 5.7 per 10,000 births (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07, 1.54). Furthermore, those with prepregnancy wildfire exposure were also found to have higher rates of gastroschisis, 12.5 vs. 5.7 per 10,000 births, (aRR 2.17, 95% CI 1.42, 3.52). In contrast, second- and third-trimester wildfire exposures were not associated with foetal gastroschisis. Conclusions Wildfire exposure within 30 days before pregnancy was associated with more than two times higher risk of foetal gastroschisis, whereas a 28% higher risk was demonstrated if exposure was in the first trimester.";"environmental exposure; gastroschisis; pregnancy; wildfire; EARLY PRENATAL EXPOSURE; AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; UNITED-STATES; BIRTH-WEIGHT; HEALTH IMPACTS; PREVALENCE; TRENDS; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; DEFECTS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Methods: Project Medishare set up a field hospital in Port-au-Prince 48 hours after the event. Our institution staffed the pediatric component for 45 days, with sequential deployment of 9 volunteer medical teams. Evolving facility and manpower requirements and changing patient demographics over time were evaluated. Results: Delegations consisted of surgeons, pediatricians, nurses, operating room (OR) personnel, physical therapists, pharmacists, and support staff. Primary goals involved creation of a child-specific ward, pediatric OR, and a wound care center. Major inpatient demographic changes occurred as time from the disaster elapsed. Initial census showed that 93% of the patients were surgical admissions with 40% undergoing operations, mostly fracture and wound care, over the first week. Eight weeks later, medical illnesses accounted for 70% of inpatients, whereas OR volume dropped by more than 50%. A second trend involved increasing acuity of care. Initially, children were admitted for serious or limb-threatening, but usually not life-threatening, injuries. Within 2 months, one third of the patients were housed in the developing NICU/PICU; and only 12% were admitted for injuries related to the earthquake. This change in patient needs led to alterations in facility requirements and in staffing and leadership needs. Conclusion: A disaster involving significant casualties in a populated area demands the rapid development of a field facility with pediatric personnel. Requirements for equipment, manpower, medical records, and systems addressing volunteer stress and ethical dilemmas can be anticipated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to investigate associations between exposure to chemicals during pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes or preeclampsia. The cohort included singleton births in Sweden between 1994 and 2014. The cohort was limited to low-educated mothers to reduce potential confounding from unidentified life-style associated factors. Information on occupation (full-time employed) at beginning of pregnancy, demographic data, education, personal risk factors and medical diagnoses were obtained from national records. Occupational exposure to 20 chemicals/particles was assessed by a timespecific job exposure matrix (SweJEM). Relative risks (RR) were adjusted for birth year of the child and mother's age, parity, country of birth, smoking, BMI, and occupational exposure to physical strain, low decision authority, noise, and whole-body vibrations. There were 307,985 births in the cohort. The risk of preeclampsia was elevated after exposure to diesel engine exhaust (RR 1.19; 95 % CI 1.03-1.37), gasoline engine exhaust (RR 1.26; 1.05-1.52) or to carbon monoxide (RR 1.21; 1.03-1.42). Exposure to lead was associated with an elevated risk of gestational diabetes, (RR 2.41; 1.05-5.55), based on six cases only, though. An elevated risk of preeclampsia in association with combustion products is corroborated by studies of traffic-related urban air pollution and of smoke from wildfires. Exposure to motor exhaust during pregnancy should be minimised.

We tested whether infant mortality was a response to the effects of flooding on food availability and whether male takeovers resulted in greater opportunities for infanticide. During our study, 43 of 113 infants died at a mean age of 5 mo. In 24 cases the cause of death was unknown. In the remaining 19 cases infant deaths were attributed to periods of intense flooding (N = 8), replacement of the breeding male (N = 8), problems associated with birth (N = 2), and injuries during an intergroup encounter (N = 1). Flooding reduced the availability of mature leaves, which appeared to play an important role in the ability of mothers to nurse their offspring. Male replacements occurred in four social groups that contained only one fully adult male. Infant mortality was significantly higher in groups that experienced male replacement compared to groups without male replacement. These results indicate that infant mortality in Alouatta caraya is affected by several factors-natural disasters, maternal condition and food availability, infanticide after male replacement, and possibly disease and predation-each of which needs to be evaluated to understand the history and demography of this primate population.";"Alouatta caraya; Flooding; Infanticide; Male replacement; Social strategies; KIBALE-NATIONAL-PARK; RING-TAILED LEMURS; MONKEY BIRTH DATA; PARANA RIVER; CHIMPANZEES; POPULATION; DEMOGRAPHY; CONSEQUENCES; REPRODUCTION; SEASONALITY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

This study investigates the trend of perinatal mortality rates in Fukushima Prefecture and four neighboring prefectures (Miyagi, Gunma, Tochigi, and Ibaraki) after the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011. Material and methods. Japanese monthly perinatal mortality data on a prefecture level are available on a website of the Japanese government. A combined regression of perinatal mortality rates from the study region and the rest of Japan (the control region) is conducted. The regression model allows for an asymptotic lower limit and a level change of perinatal mortality rates in 2012-2017 in the study region relative to the predicted trend. Results. In 2012-2017, perinatal mortality in the study region shows a significant 10.6% increase relative to the trend in preceding years (p = 0.006). The excess mortality translates to 195 (95% CI: 28, 462) excess perinatal deaths. The increase is three times greater in Fukushima Prefecture than in the four neighboring prefectures and the difference in excess rates is statistically significant (p = 0.010). Periodic peaks of perinatal mortality are found in 2012-2017 with maxima around April. Conclusion. We find an increase in perinatal mortality in Fukushima and four neighboring prefectures after the Fukushima nuclear accident. The results agree with similar observations in Germany and Ukraine after the Chernobyl disaster. Due to its ecological design, the study cannot prove a causal link between radiation exposure and perinatal mortality. Continued observation of the trend of perinatal mortality in contaminated regions of Japan is recommended.";"perinatal mortality; Fukushima; ecological study; nonlinear regression; cesium; mushrooms; GERMANY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Existing evidence has generally found that drought impacts birthweight and infant sex, with differences by trimester. Additionally, less research has looked at the impact of excess rain on birth outcomes or focused on the impact of rainfall extremes in the preconception period. Using data from a large demographic surveillance system in Nepal, combined with a novel measure of drought/excess rainfall, we explore the impact of these on birthweight by time in pregnancy.

Results: Drought in the first trimester is associated with lower birthweight (beta = -82.9 g; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 164.7, -1.2) and drought in the preconception period with a high likelihood of having a male (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.01, 2.01).

Methods: Using time-series study, we estimated the relative risks (RRs) of emergency department (ED) visits for pregnancy complications in eight affected counties in New York State, based on data of 2005-2014. The immediate impact was estimated by comparing the ED visits of pregnancy complications during the Sandy period to the non-Sandy periods. For the lasting impact of Sandy, we estimated the RRs by contrasting the ED visits in the following 12 months after Sandy with the same months of other years. Results: We found that ED visits for overall pregnancy complications increased 6.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 22%, 10.5%) during the Sandy month.

This study aims to understand the after flood effects on children in the worst flood-hit districts of Assam during the last decades most devastating flood where more than 1,00,000 people were affected. Study design A cross sectional population-based study was done covering 7512 children of 0-12 years of age in 35 worse flood-affected villages in three districts of lower Assam for nutritional risk profiling, low birth weight and morbidity pattern. Method Anthropometric measurements of the children were compared with standard WHO definitions for nutritional risk profiling. ANOVA was conducted to see any relationship of nutritional status between the age groups and BMI for the districts. Two-factor ANOVA to analyse the effect of ARI on the morbidity status of different districts was done. District-wise and village-wise heat maps were generated to understand different nutritional parameters for analysing which areas within each district are more affected and why. Results The moderate (< 2SD) and severely underweight (< 3SD) children under 5 years of age were highest in the Barpeta district (45.5% and 24.2% respectively). The moderate and severe stunting was highest in Morigaon (47.6%) and Barpeta (24.3%) respectively. The moderate and severe wasting was highest in the Morigaon district (46.1% and 20.6% respectively). All the nutritional indicators were less than the WHO standard. The age-wise and district-wise distribution of nutritional status shows variations in all three districts. Severe underweight was observed highest among 24-35 months' children (50.9%) in Barpeta. The moderate and severe undernutrition status was found to be higher among the age group of 10-12 years of age compared to 5 to 10 years. Conclusion This survey has provided a comprehensive picture of the nutritional status of the targeted children in the worst flood-affected areas. However, attention to its impact on health particularly among those exposed at very early stages in life is still lacking. This kind of rapid assessment helps to understand the health and nutritional status of the vulnerable groups in a deeper way and to plan robust region-specific interventions.";"Flood; Flooding emergency; Nutritional status; Children; Morbidity pattern; HEALTH";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

However, the availability of perinatal resources in communities impacted by smoke is unknown. Objective: Describe perinatal resources in counties prone to wildfire smoke. Research Study Design: Smoke data came from the Hazard Mapping System and perinatal resources were gathered from various sources. Choropleth maps described the geographic distribution of smoke. Unadjusted associations and multivariable regressions compared perinatal resource levels by smoke risk. Subgroup analysis of the most rural counties was conducted. Subjects: Counties in the contiguous United States (n=3108) during the 2016-2020 period. Measures: Relative smoke risk was defined as the bottom, middle, and top third of the average annual smoke-days distribution. Perinatal resources included driving distance to the nearest maternity care hospital and NICU, the volume and geographic isolation of the nearest maternity care hospital, and county-based measures of OB-GYN and family medicine physicians. Results: Average annual smoke-days ranged from 3.8 (SD=2.0) in low-risk to 15.3 (SD=5.5) in high-risk counties. Compared with low-risk counties, high-risk counties had fewer OB-GYNs per 10,000 births (-32.2, 95% CI: -45.7 to -20.6; P<0.001) and were farther to the nearest maternity hospital (10.1 miles, 95% CI: 8.7-11.5; P<0.001). High-risk counties were also farther to the nearest NICU. Associations were not explained by sociodemographics and were observed in the subset of the most rural counties. Conclusions: Communities prone to wildfire smoke often lack geographic access to the health care resources needed to treat pregnant people and infants in a timely manner.";"perinatal care; wildfires; climate change; HEALTH; IMPACT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Additionally, wildfires are of growing concern due to their increasing frequency and severity. The objective was to examine the impact of wildfire smoke on fertility, timing of birth, and pregnancy loss for field monkeys. A unique case-control study to investigate birth outcomes in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) was conducted at the CNPRC. All females in the study were maintained in outdoor fields during a period of elevated ambient wildfire smoke from November 8-22, 2018. In addition to ambient air quality evaluations, the effects on fertility, timing to birth, and pregnancy loss were documented. Archival records of approximately 5,000 conceptions from the previous nine years served as control data. During the Camp Fire, ambient fine particulate (PM 2.5) levels exceeded the 24 -h National Ambient Air Quality Standard (35 mu g/m 3) of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, reaching levels as high as 185 mu g/m 3.

The rate of neonatal mortality reduction in Ethiopia is slow, and Ethiopia may not meet the third United Nations sustainable development target by 2030. This study aimed to investigate the spatial variations and contributing factors for neonatal mortality rates in Ethiopia. Methods We analysed data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS), which used a two-stage cluster sampling technique with a census enumeration area as primary and households as secondary sampling units. A Bayesian spatial logistic regression model using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) method was fitted accounting for socio-economic, health service-related and geographic factors. Results Higher neonatal mortality rates were observed in eastern, northeastern and southeastern Ethiopia, and the Somali region had higher risks of neonatal mortality. Neonates from frequently drought-affected areas had a higher mortality risk than less drought-affected areas. Application of traditional substances on the cord increased the risk of neonatal mortality (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.07, 95% Credible Interval (CrI): 1.12 to 4.30) and getting health facility delivery services had a lower odds of neonatal mortality (AOR = 0.60, 95% CrI: 0.37, 0.98).

Our survival analyses combine several rare and valuable long-term datasets, including long-term primate life-history, landscape-scale fruit abundance, food-tree mortality, and climate conditions. Infant capuchins showed a threshold mortality response to drought, with exceptionally high mortality during a period of intense drought, but not during periods of moderate water shortage.

The commonest cause of trauma during pregnancy is road traffic accidents. An 18-year-old G2 P1 L1 at 13 weeks of gestation living in a makeshift tent near a construction site came under a landslide. She remained buried under the rubbles until she could be excavated next day. Patient reached our facility almost 27 h after the incident. Primary survey revealed patent airway; however, she had tachypnea, tachycardia and hypotension, positive FAST examination, and fetus floating in fluid filled peritoneal cavity on USG abdomen. Patient was resuscitated and immediately taken for exploration, which revealed hemoperitoneum, uterine fundus perforation with decapitated fetus in the peritoneal cavity, two jejunal perforations, and tear in urinary bladder wall and anterior vaginal wall. Primary repair of jejunal and uterine perforations with suprapubic cystostomy (SPC) was followed by repair of the anterior vaginal wall at a later stage. Patient was discharged in healthy condition and is doing well on follow-up. Management of trauma in pregnancy is challenging due to physiological changes and involves concurrent resuscitation of two patients.

Disaster preparedness is key to a well-coordinated response to preventing sexual violence and assisting survivors, reducing the transmission of HIV and other STIs, and preventing excess maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. This study aimed to identify the capacity development activities undertaken as part of the SPRINT program in Fiji and Tonga and how these enabled the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) response to Tropical Cyclones Winston and Gita. Methods This descriptive qualitative study was informed by a framework designed to assess public health emergency response capacity across various levels (systems, organisational, and individual) and two phases of the disaster management cycle (preparedness and response). Eight key informants were recruited purposively to include diverse individuals from relevant organisations and interviewed by telephone, Zoom, Skype and email. Template analysis was used to examine the data. Findings Differences in the country contexts were highlighted. The existing program of training in Tonga, investment from the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) Humanitarian Hub, the status of the Tonga Family Health Association as the key player in the delivery of SRH, together with its long experience of delivering contract work in short time-frames and strong relationship with the Ministry of Health (MoH) facilitated a relatively smooth and rapid response. In contrast, there had been limited capacity development work in Fiji prior to Winston, requiring training to be rapidly delivered during the immediate response to the cyclone with the support of surge staff from IPPF. In Fiji, the response was initially hampered by a lack of clarity concerning stakeholder roles and coordination, but linkages were quickly built to enable a response. Participants highlighted the importance of personal relationships, individuals' and organisations' motivation to respond, and strong rapport with the community to deliver SRH. Discussion This study highlights the need for comprehensive activities at multiple levels within a country and across the Pacific region to build capacity for a SRH response. While the SPRINT initiative has been implemented across several regions to improve organisational and national capacity preparedness, training for communities can be strengthened. This research outlines the importance of formalising partnerships and regular meetings and training to ensure the currency of coordination efforts in readiness for activation. However, work is needed to further institutionalise SRH in emergencies in national policy and accountability mechanisms. Plain Language Summary Pacific Island countries experience many disasters, including cyclones and earthquakes. The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) has been working in the Pacific to help build skills to improve the response to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and rights during disasters. This paper describes research to identify capacity building activities that helped prepare organisations in Fiji and Tonga and how this affected the delivery of SRH during Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016, and Tropical Cyclone Gita in 2018. Key informants in senior positions from relevant organisations were recruited and interviewed by telephone, Zoom, Skype and email. We used a framework that described different levels of capacity across phases of the disaster management cycle to analyse the data. Eight key informants described differences in Fiji and Tonga's preparedness activities before Tropical Cyclones Winston and Gita that affected the way in which services were delivered. The Tonga Family Health Association was well established as a key player in SRH service delivery before Gita and had built relationships and delivered training for disaster response to staff across a number of organisations including the Ministry of Health (MoH). These preparedness efforts facilitated a smooth and rapid response. In Fiji, the response was initially affected by a lack of training, role clarity and coordination, but linkages were quickly built to deliver care and services. Participants highlighted the importance of personal relationships, individuals' and organisations' motivation to respond, and strong links with the community to deliver SRH care. This study highlights the need for inclusive activities at individual, organisational and national levels within countries and across the Pacific region to build capacity for a SRH response.";"Sexual and reproductive health; Pacific Islands; Humanitarian crisis; Preparedness; Capacity building; Disaster response";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

In the present study, we sought to determine the prevalence and risks of mental disorders in adults who experienced earthquake as an infant or in the prenatal period. Methods: This cross-sectional cohort study recruited participants based on the urban resident registry of Tangshan, Hebei province, 2013 using a multistage stratified cluster sampling method with selection probabilities proportional to size. We recruited subjects who were born between July 29, 1975 and April 28, 1978 that was one year before and 1.9 years after the occurrence of Tangshan Earthquake, respectively. Current psychiatric diagnoses and lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were obtained through the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders Patient Research Version. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze risk factors of mental disorders. Results: Totally1380 subjects were included with 392 subjects exposed to the earthquake in the fetal period, 399 subjects who experienced the earthquake during their infancy, and 589 subjects who had no exposure to the earthquake. Twenty-one (2.7%; current 1.9%) subjects exposed to earthquake were diagnosed with major depressive disorderversus 2.3% (current 1.5%) in the non-exposure group. Five (0.6%; current 0.6%) subjects with exposure to earthquake had bipolar disorder versus 0.9% in the non-exposure group. Thirteen (1.6%; current 1.6%) subjects with exposure to earthquake had schizophreniaversus 0.2% in the non-exposure group (P = 0.006). Furthermore, 5.2% (current 3.7%) subjects with exposure to earthquake had anxiety disorders versus 5.7% (current 3.9%) in the non-exposure group. Moreover, 8.1% (current 7.0%)subjects with exposure to earthquake had alcohol use disorders versus 7.1% (current 5.3%) in the non-exposure group. Furthermore, the prevalence of schizophrenia of the prenatal exposure group (2.3%) was significantly higher than the other two groups (chi(2) = 10.273, P = 0.006); however, no statistically significant difference was found in the current and lifetime prevalence of other DSM-IV axis I disorders among the three groups (P > 0.05).

To investigate whether this tremendous earthquake exerted adverse effects on the reproductive and developmental functions in Sprague-Dawley rats, we collected some relevant data from reproductive toxicity studies around the earthquake, and compared them with the background data, which were gathered before and after the earthquake. Copulation ratio, gestation ratio, and fertility of female rats, as well as uterine and fetal morphology, were examined. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that the Wenchuan earthquake significantly decreased the copulation and gestation ratio, although it did not exhibit obvious side effects on some other reproductive and developmental parameters.

To determine the dependency of the effect on distance from the FDNPP, the study region is divided into four core prefectures and eight prefectures surrounding the core prefectures. Results Perinatal mortality rates in the study region show a significant 6.4% (95% CI: 1.8%, 13.4%) overall increase in 2012-2019 relative to the trend in preceding years with no attenuation during 2012-19. The increase translates to 590 (165, 1226) excess perinatal deaths (p = 0.016). It is characterized by annual peaks with maxima in April. A 13.6% increase is determined in the four core prefectures and a 4.3% increase in eight prefectures surrounding the core prefectures. Before 2012, there is a peak around April 2011 and a decline in October 2011; another significant peak is detected in November 2012. In the 4 core prefectures, large increases are found in the first quarter of 2018 (+70%) and in May 2019 (+130%). Conclusion This study finds periodic peaks in perinatal mortality in spring 2012-2019 in 12 prefectures of Japan surrounding the FDNPP. In light of massive increases in 2018 and 2019 in the four core prefectures, continued investigation of perinatal mortality in contaminated regions of Japan is recommended.";"CHERNOBYL; GERMANY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

We classified the studies using three exposure types: (1) physical exposure to toxicants; (2) psychological trauma; and (3) general exposure to disaster. Fifteen articles met our inclusion criteria concerning research focus and design. Overall studies pertained to eight different disasters, with most (n = 6) focused on the World Trade Center attack. Only one study examined pregnancy loss, i.e., occurrence of spontaneous abortions post-disaster. Most studies focused on associations between disaster and adverse birth outcomes, but two studies pertained only to post-disaster fertility while another two examined it in addition to adverse birth outcomes. In most studies disaster-affected populations were assumed to have experienced psychological trauma, but exposure to trauma was measured in only four studies. Furthermore, effects of both physical exposure to toxicants and psychological trauma on disaster-affected populations were examined in only one study. Effects on birth outcomes were not consistently demonstrated, and study methodologies varied widely. Even so, these studies suggest an association between disasters and reproductive health and highlight the need for further studies to clarify associations. We postulate that post-disaster surveillance among pregnant women could improve our understanding of effects of disaster on the reproductive health of US pregnant women.";"Disaster; Birth outcomes; Low birth weight; Preterm birth; Fertility; WORLD-TRADE-CENTER; BIRTH OUTCOMES; CENTER DISASTER; WOMEN; EFFICIENCY; EXPOSURE; WEIGHT; IMPACT; FLOOD; CITY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Infants born to mothers exposed to earthquakes in the second trimester are 1.8% more likely to be large for gestational age (LGA), which is a large effect from a baseline of 7% of LGA newborns. The reported impact varies across mothers' socioeconomic status, with relatively poorer Chilean mothers being more vulnerable to earthquakes. A possible mechanism that explains these results could work through changes in the incidence of women with diabetes. We provide indirect evidence in this regard. Mothers with diabetes are more likely to have large-for-gestational-age babies. Exposure to earthquakes increases the incidence of diabetes among the affected population, with the observed impact on diabetes being relatively higher among women of lower socioeconomic status.

This method enables to estimate variables dynamic relationships in both the long and short run, and is ideal for addressing the complexity of extreme climatic event interactions. The empirical findings indicate that particulate matter (PM2.5), and increased frequency of natural disaster events have a significant positive relationship with higher infant mortality rates in both long and shortrun, as 1 % rise in disasters and PM2.5 levels results in 0.05 % and 0.12 % rise in infant mortality rates respectively in the long run.

We especially wanted to find out whether the decline in mortality is continuous and whether there are still deaths that could be prevented. Methods: We analyzed mortality data obtained from the official cause of death statistics in Finland from 1969 to 2004. Annual mortality rates were calculated in proportion to those at risk of dying. Comparison of cause specific mortality rates was conducted for neonatal group and children aged 1 month to 15 years. Results: Annual neonatal mortality declined from 11.13 parts per thousand in 1969 to 2.46 parts per thousand in 2004. The leading causes of death were perinatal disorders and congenital malformations. Mortality among children aged 1 month to 15 years declined from 0.67 parts per thousand in 1969 to 0.23 parts per thousand in 2004, with accidents the leading cause of death, although congenital malformations, tumours and haematological diseases, and infectious diseases were significant causes as well. There was a notable peak in total mortality in 2004, as 44 Finnish children died in the Asian tsunami in December of that year. Conclusion: Childhood mortality in Finland has decreased significantly during recent decades. Prevention programmes should be directed towards reducing mortality from accidents by promoting traffic safety and ensuring a safer environment.

Training programs can promote natural disaster readiness to respond and evacuate patients safely, but also require evidence-based information to guide learning objectives. Problem: There is limited evidence on what skills and bedside equipment are most important to include in disaster training and evacuation programs for critically ill infants. Methods: An expert panel was used to create a 13-item mastery checklist of skills for bedside registered nurses (RNs) required to successfully evacuate a critically ill infant. Expert nurses were surveyed, and the Angoff method was used to determine which of the mastery checklist skills a newly graduated nurse (ie, the ""minimally competent"" nurse) should be able to do. Participants then rated the importance of 26 commonly available pieces of bedside equipment for use in evacuating a hemodynamically unstable, intubated infant during a disaster. Results: Twenty-three emergency department (ED) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) charge RNs responded to the survey with a mean of 19 (SD = 9) years of experience and 30% reporting personal experience with evacuating patients. The skills list scores showed an emphasis on the newly graduated nurse having more complete mastery of skills surrounding thermoregulation, documentation, infection control, respiratory support, and monitoring. Skills for communication, decision making, and anticipating future needs were assessed as less likely for a new nurse to have mastered. On a scale of one (not important) to seven (critically important), the perceived necessity of equipment ranged from a low of 1.6 (breast pump) to a high of 6.9 (face mask). The individual intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.55 showed moderate reliability between raters and the average team ICC of 0.97 showed excellent agreement as a group. Conclusion: Experts rated the ability to manage physiological issues, such as thermoregulation and respiratory support, as skills that every nurse should master. Disaster preparedness activities for nurses in training may benefit from checklists of essential equipment and skills to ensure all nurses can independently manage patients' physiologic needs when they enter the workforce. Advanced nursing training should include education on decision making, communication during emergencies, and anticipation of future issues to ensure that charge and resource nurses can support bedside nurses during evacuation events.";"disaster; hospital evacuation; infant; nursing training; NURSES; PREPAREDNESS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

It is known that physical, logistical and technical resources are heavily utilised in the treatment and care processes within ICUs. However, our knowledge of how these resources are managed during and after disasters remains limited. Aim The aim of this study was to explore the experiences, challenges and decision-making mechanisms of nurses working in neonatal ICUs (NICUs) during an earthquake. Study Design This study employed a qualitative exploratory research design with a phenomenological approach. In-depth individual interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide between January and April 2025. A total of 18 nurses who worked in the NICUs of two different hospitals during and after the 2023 Kahramanmara & scedil; earthquakes in Turkey were included in the study using criterion sampling. Data were analysed using inductive content analysis methods. The Max Qualitative Data Analysis (2020) software was used for data coding. Results As a result of the data analysis, three main themes and 13 sub-themes were identified. The themes were as follows: 'Emergency Response and Implementation Challenges', 'Strategies Developed for the Safety of Newborns' and 'Psychological and Emotional Burdens of Nurses'. In addition, the topics 'Insufficiency in Material Supply', 'Problems Arising from Inadequate Staffing' and 'Experience of Loss and Grief' were found to be mentioned more frequently than other codes. Conclusions The findings showed that nurses faced challenges stemming from multiple professional, organisational, environmental and educational factors during the early phase of the disaster. Participants' perspectives revealed a strong relationship between professional competence in first response, disaster preparedness, traumatic burden and burnout. Relevance to Clinical Practice Identifying the challenges experienced by vulnerable populations during disasters, integrating these groups into disaster management plans, developing guidelines, promoting professional knowledge exchange and regularly conducting hands-on disaster training are of great importance.";"disaster; disaster management; earthquake; neonatal intensive care; paediatric nursing; DISASTER";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Design Retrospective cohort study. Choice of variables informed by literature and Delphi consensus. Setting Study conducted during the baseline phase of a community level intervention for pre-eclampsia that was led by community health workers. Participants A household census identified 50 493 households that were home to 80 483 women of reproductive age (age 12-49 years). Of these women, 14 617 had been pregnant in the 12 months prior to the census, of which 9172 (61.6%) had completed their pregnancies. Primary and secondary outcome measures A combined fetal, maternal and neonatal outcome was calculated for all women with completed pregnancies. Results A total of six variables were statistically significant (p=0.05) in explaining the combined outcome. These included: geographic isolation, flood proneness, access to an improved latrine, average age of reproductive age woman, family support and fertility rates. The performance of the ordinary least squares model was an adjusted R-2=0.69. Three of the variables (isolation, latrine score and family support) showed significant geographic variability in their effect on rates of adverse outcome. Accounting for this modest non-stationary effect through geographically weighted regression increased the adjusted R-2 to 0.71. Conclusions The community exploration was successful in identifying context-specific determinants of maternal health. The results highlight the need for designing targeted interventions that address the place-specific social determinants of maternal health in the study area.

After Katrina, obstetric, prenatal, and neonatal care was compromised in the short term, but increases in adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight, and maternal complications were mostly limited to highly exposed women. Both pregnant and postpartum women had rates of post-traumatic stress disorder similar to, or lower than, others exposed to Katrina, and rates of depression similar to other pregnant and postpartum populations. Health behaviors, such as smoking and breastfeeding, may have been somewhat negatively affected by the disaster, whereas effects on nutrition were likely associated with limited time, money, and food choices, and indicated by both weight gain and loss. We conclude that, with a few specific exceptions, postdisaster concerns and health outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women were similar to those of other people exposed to Hurricane Katrina. In such situations, disaster planners and researchers should focus on providing care and support for the normal concerns of the peripartum period, such as breastfeeding, depression, and smoking cessation.

Changes in population size, composition, and distribution may result from these occurrences. This study, which spans the years 1966-2018, looks at how Bangladesh's total fertility rate (TFR) is affected by extreme weather events and child mortality, including neonatal, infant, male infant, and under-five mortality. We use data from secondary publicly accessible sources, such as the World Bank and The Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), and we investigate the correlations using the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), complemented by bivariate and multivariable analyses. Our findings from the univariate analysis are noteworthy. Total extreme climate events ((3 = -0.345, 95 % CI: 0.510, -0.180), as well as individual extreme climate events, such as extreme temperatures ((3 = -1.176, 95 % CI: 1.88, -0.47), floods ((3 = - 0.644, 95 % CI: 1.0729, -0.216), and storms ((3 = -0.351, 95 % CI: 0.63159, -0.07154), exhibited negative associations with the TFR. Additionally, factors such as contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) ((3 = -0.085, 95 % CI: 0.09072, -0.07954) and gross national income (GNI) per capita ((3 = -0.003, 95 % CI: 0.0041123, -0.0024234) were negatively correlated with the TFR. Conversely, various categories of child mortality, namely, infants ((3 = 0.041, 95 % CI: 0.040474, 0.042748), males ((3 = 0.038, 95 % CI:0.037719, 0.039891), and under-five ((3 = 0.026, 95 % CI:0.025684, 0.026979) - are positively associated with TFR. Controlling for two pivotal confounding factors, time and GNI per capita, yielded consistent results in the multivariate analysis. These findings provide insight on the dual impact of extreme weather events, which can reduce TFR while also raising it through infant mortality. This phenomena may be due to the increased vulnerability of younger children in climate-event-prone areas, prompting parents to seek additional children as both a replacement for lost offspring and an insurance mechanism against future child loss.";"Floods; Storms; Extreme temperature events; Child mortality; Total fertility rate (TFR); Bangladesh; NATURAL DISASTERS; HURRICANE KATRINA; CONTRACEPTIVE USE; SEX-RATIO; BIRTH; POPULATION; ENVIRONMENT; MARRIAGE; HEALTH; IMPACT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The number of births experienced a baby boom for about 10 years following 1945, peaking in 1973. Birthplaces shifted from home deliveries to medical facilities, with doctors becoming the primary birth attendants. Academically, the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (JAOG) for Maternal Protection and the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG) were established in 1949. In the medical field, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) were introduced and neonatal transport systems became well-established by the 1970s. In 1976, the limit of viability was revised from under 28 weeks of gestation to under 24 weeks. The late 1970s saw the fetal heart rate monitoring, the heartbeat detection using Doppler ultrasound and the ultrasound imaging techniques. 1980s: The perinatal medicine became well established, leading to hold The Japan Society of Perinatal Medicine. For fetal management, the fields of fetal diagnosis and fetal treatment entered their early stages with the widespread use of fetal heart rate monitoring and ultrasound imaging. In neonatal care, neonatal transport systems to NICU facilities were enhanced. A major breakthrough in this field was the discovery and widespread use of pulmonary surfactant. Two key concepts that emerged and advanced during this period were maternal transport systems and the Perinatal Maternal and Child Center initiative. In 1987, cases of hepatitis caused by non-heat-treated coagulation products became a major issue. As a result, informed consent affecting mothers and fetuses became a significant point of discussion. The Obstetrics and Gynecology Specialist system was introduced, along with the regular publication of Training Notes for Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Glossary of Obstetrics and Gynecology Terms. As a result of these efforts, both the perinatal mortality rate and the maternal mortality rate were reduced by approximately half over the course of 10 years. 1990s: In 1991, the limit of viability was revised to 22 weeks of gestation. In terms of maternal care, nutritional management guidelines for general pregnant women were introduced. In fetal medicine, major topics included the administration of steroids to the mother to promote fetal lung maturation, as well as direct fetal treatments such as shunt procedures and needle aspirations. In neonatal care, inhaled nitric oxide therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment became more widely adopted. Following the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, in 1995, led to the development of the Disaster Medical Assistance Team and the establishment of Perinatal Maternal and Child Medical Center. In 1996, the Maternal Protection Law was enacted, and the Japan Council for Quality Health Care (JCQHC) was founded to standardize medical care. Asia & Oceania Federation of Obstetrics & Gynecology Journal and Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology Research were launched as English-language academic journals. 2000s: Japan's perinatal mortality rate became the lowest in the world, but the maternal mortality rate was still struggling. Obstetric care changed significantly after an obstetrician was arrested for causing a maternal death during a cesarean section. The JSOG and the JAOG developed practice guidelines describing standard obstetric diagnosis and treatments, and the JCQHC established the Japan Obstetric Compensation System for Cerebral Palsy. In addition, a project to report on maternal deaths by JAOG was also launched, and the combination of these measures led to form a framework of professional autonomy for obstetricians. During this period, brain hypothermic therapy for brain injury was developed. 2010s: The Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 led to major changes in disaster medical planning. This included the introduction of training programs for disaster medical coordinators and the development of disaster-time pediatric and perinatal liaisons. To enhance medical safety, JAOG launched an incidental case reporting system in 2004. Additionally, in 2010, a maternal mortality reporting system was introduced, followed by the maternal severe complications reporting system in 2021. The Japan Council for Implementation of Maternal Emergency Life-Saving System was established, along with the Japan Association for Labor Analgesia, a collaborative council for academic societies and organizations related to painless delivery. Suicide as a significant cause of maternal death led to the establishment of the ""Mother and Child Mental Forum"" academic conference, which later evolved into the Mental Health Care for Mother & Child training program. In the field of prenatal testing, non-invasive prenatal testing was introduced as a clinical research initiative. From 2020 onward: The year 2020 began with the global outbreak of COVID-19. Until 2023, numerous issues arose due to repeated pandemics, including delivery methods and locations for COVID-positive pregnant women, standard precautions during labor, mother-infant separation after birth, vaccination, so on. JSOG and JAOG worked together to address these challenges. The most pressing issue in the perinatal field is the declining birth rate. Alongside an aging workforce of physicians and a shortage of successors, the decrease in new obstetric clinic openings has become a major concern. By 2024, the decrease in the number of full-time obstetricians and the overtime work limits in Medical Care Act are making it necessary to reconsider the structure of obstetric medical services. Japan's perinatal care system, which has maintained the highest global standards, now stands at a major crossroads.ConclusionResearchers (clinicians), academic societies, and professional organizations, centered on the mother and child, have collaborated with support from the government, making progress and building the current safe pregnancy and childbirth management system. However, significant issues remain that need urgent attention, including regulations on overtime work, securing obstetrician numbers, the rapid decline in childbirth facilities, and the functional collapse of perinatal maternal-child healthcare centers. These are critical challenges that must be addressed promptly.";"advance in obstetrical care; JAOG; JSOG; maternal mortality; perinatal mortality; THERAPY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Displacement risk scales with the vulnerability of exposed populations, but this vulnerability is poorly understood at a global scale. Here we show that measures of human development and rural areas explain more of the variance of displacement vulnerability than income levels measured by gross domestic product. We combine global flood and displacement data to estimate vulnerability, as the ratio of displacement to exposure, for over 300 historical flood events. We find that this vulnerability varies by several orders of magnitude both between and within countries. A random forest regression shows that infant mortality rate and population density are among the most important predictors of displacement vulnerability at national level and within countries, respectively, highlighting the vulnerability of low-income and marginalized populations and of rural communities. Our results indicate that, rather than relying on overall economic development alone, targeted investments are needed to improve living conditions and coping capacities for the most vulnerable groups, particularly outside of large cities, and to prepare for increasing flood hazards due to climate change.";"SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CROSS-VALIDATION; RISK; MODEL; POPULATION; HAZARD";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Drought as a complex phenomenon causes severe impacts on ecological and socio-economic status. Short-term and long-term occurrences of drought have made many regions vulnerable globally. This paper makes an attempt to assess drought vulnerability in Godavari Middle Sub-basin of India. Twenty-four site specific socio-economic and environmental factors were identified based on the extensive literature review. Drought frequency was assessed using standardized precipitation index (SPI). These datasets were divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) data. Frequency ratio (FR) model was utilized to establish relationship among drought conditioning factors and drought frequency. Weights obtained from the FR model were used as input to the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) model. Drought vulnerability results were validated using the testing data and receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The accuracy of ANFIS models for 1-month (0.957), 3-months (0.882), 6-months (0.964) and 12-months (0.938) showed high suitability of ANFIS model for the assessment of drought vulnerability. The findings revealed that very low normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and increasing trend of highest maximum and mean maximum temperature were major environmental factors which influenced high drought vulnerability in the sub-basin. High proportion of area under fallow land, high infant mortality rate (IMR) and moderate literacy rate were identified as major socio-economic factors making watersheds vulnerable during short and long-term droughts. Largest area of the sub-basin was found under high vulnerability for 3-months, followed by 6-months and 12-months droughts. Thus, the study calls for policy intervention towards lessening the impact of drought in highly vulnerable watersheds.";"Drought vulnerability; SPI index; Frequency ratio model; ANFIS model; Godavari middle sub-basin; DIFFERENCE WATER INDEX; RIVER-BASIN; STATE; VEGETATION; IMPACTS; CLIMATE; RISK; AGRICULTURE; NDWI";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Differential toxicity is present in the oocytes of monkeys, with more severe damage identified in primordial germ cells rather than in growing oocytes. However, this observation did not express itself in women, as there was no increased incidence of premature menopause among those exposed. Germ cell toxicity remains a possible outcome of exposure, however.

In this study, we estimate the impact of displacement on infant and child mortality and key health-behavior mechanisms. Methods: We employ a difference-in-differences (DID) design with coarsened exact matching (CEM) to ensure comparability among groups with different displacement status using the 2012 Haiti Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The participants are 21,417 births reported by a nationally representative sample of 14,287 women aged 15-49. The main independent variables are household displacement status which includes households living in camps, IDP households (not in camps), and households not displaced. The main outcomes are infant and child mortality; health status (height-for-age, anemia); uptake of public health interventions (bed net use, spraying against mosquitoes, and vaccinations); and other conditions (hunger; cholera). Results: Births from the camp households have higher infant mortality (OR = 2.34, 95 % CI 1.15 to 4.75) and child mortality (OR = 2.34, 95 % CI 1.10 to 5.00) than those in non-camp IDP households following the earthquake. These odds are higher despite better access to food, water, bed net use, mosquito spraying, and vaccines among camp households. Conclusions: IDP populations are heterogeneous and households that are displaced outside of camps may be self-selected or self-insured. Meanwhile, even households not displaced by a disaster may face challenges in access to basic necessities and health services. Efforts are needed to identify vulnerable populations to provide targeted assistance in post-disaster relief.";"Infant mortality; Child mortality; Internally displaced people; Earthquake; Haiti; EARTHQUAKE; PROGRESS; HEALTH";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

In this context, hazard, social vulnerability and risk indexes are proposed and quantified in this paper, through a probabilistic methodology for calculating water security. Hazard is expressed by basic water services shortage, floods, groundwater depletion, and drought indicators. In turn, the vulnerability considers educational level of the population, access to health services, infant mortality rate, illiteracy, housing conditions, unemployment and proportion of indigenous language population. In the development of this study it is shown that both hazard and vulnerability throughout the Mexican territory are very heterogeneous.

This study conceptualized vulnerability as a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity by developing a composite index from a reliable dataset of 64 indicators comprising biophysical, agro-ecological, and socioeconomic variables. The empirical studies of coastal Bangladesh revealed that Bhola, Patuakhali, and Lakshmipur districts, around the mouth of the deltaic Meghna estuaries, are the hot spot of vulnerability distribution. Furthermore, the spatially heterogeneous vulnerability was triggered by spatial variation of erosion, cyclones, drought, rain-fed agriculture, land degradation, soil phosphorus, crop productivity, sanitation and housing condition, infant mortality, emergency shelters, adoption of agro-technology. The integrated approach could be useful for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation intervention by substituting various hypothetical scenarios into the ALVI framework for baseline comparison.";"climate change; agriculture vulnerability; spatially heterogeneous; adaptation decision; coastal Bangladesh; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; VARIABILITY; FRAMEWORK; RISKS; COMMUNITIES; INDICATORS; IMPACTS; PERCEPTIONS; ADAPTATION; FISHERIES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

However, there are few detailed reports on emergency vitrification in a state of disaster, especially about oocytes and D0 zygotes. Therefore, the effectiveness and safety of emergency vitrification of oocytes and D0-D5 embryos in disaster states are still unclear.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective study was made in the Reproductive Medicine Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2018 to November 2022. The record rainstorms in Zhengzhou, China, caused severe flooding, traffic disruptions, and power outages. From 17:30, 20 July 2021 to 17:30, 21 July 2021, 1246 oocytes and D0-D5 embryos of 155 patients were vitrified whilst the laboratory had only an emergency power supply.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: As of 21 December 2021, 1149 emergency vitrified oocytes and D0-D5 embryos of 124 patients underwent frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET). They were divided into the following four groups according to the days of embryo culture in vitro: oocyte group, Day 0-Day 1 (D0-D1) group, Day 2-Day 3 (D2-D3) group, and Day 4-Day 5 (D4-D5) group. Control groups for each were selected from fresh cycle patients who underwent IVF/ICSI from January 2018 to October 2021. Control and emergency vitrification patients were matched on criteria that included age, fertilization method, days of embryonic development, and number and grade of transferred embryos. A total of 493 control patients were randomly selected from the eligible patients and matched with the emergency vitrification groups in a ratio of 4:1. The results of assisted reproduction and follow-up of pregnancy were analyzed. The embryonic development, clinical outcomes, and birth outcomes in each group were statistically analyzed.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A significant difference was observed in fertilization rate (81% versus 72%, P = 0.022) between the oocyte group and the control group. Significant differences were also observed in the monozygotic twin pregnancy rate (10% versus 0%, P = 0.038) and ectopic pregnancy rate (5% versus 0%, P = 0.039) between the D0-D1 group and the control group. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed between vitrified oocytes/D0-D1 embryos/D2-D3 embryos and the control group on the number of high-quality embryos (3.17 +/- 3.00 versus 3.84 +/- 3.01, P = 0.346; 5.04 +/- 3.66 versus 4.56 +/- 2.87, P = 0.346; 4.85 +/- 5.36 versus 5.04 +/- 4.64, P = 0.839), the number of usable blastocysts (1.22 +/- 1.78 versus 1.21 +/- 2.03, P = 0.981; 2.16 +/- 2.26 versus 1.55 +/- 2.08, P = 0.090; 2.82 +/- 3.23 versus 2.58 +/- 3.32, P = 0.706), clinical pregnancy rate (56% versus 57%, P = 0.915; 55% versus 55%, P = 1.000; 40% versus 50%, P = 0.488), miscarriage rate (30% versus 15%, P = 0.496; 5% versus 11%, P = 0.678; 17% versus 20%, P = 1.000), and live birth rate (39% versus 49%, P = 0.460; 53% versus 50%, P = 0. 772; 33% versus 40%, P = 0.635). No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed between the D4-D5 group and the control group on clinical pregnancy rate (40% versus 55%, P = 0.645), miscarriage rate (0% versus 18%, P = 1.000), and live birth rate (40% versus 45%, P = 1.000)LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The retrospective study design is a limitation. The timing and extent of natural disasters are unpredictable, so the sample size of vitrified oocytes, zygotes, and embryos is beyond experimental control.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study is the first study analyzing embryonic development, clinical outcomes, and birth outcomes of large samples of oocytes, D0 zygotes, and D1-D5 embryos after emergency vitrification under the disaster conditions. The results show that emergency vitrification is a safe and effective protective measure applicable to oocytes and D0-D5 embryos. The embryology laboratories need to be equipped with an emergency uninterrupted power supply capable of delivering for 6-8 h at full load.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S:) This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 81871206).

Post-Katrina vital statistics are unavailable. The objectives of this study were to validate an alternative method to estimate child mortality rates in the greater New Orleans area and compare pre-Katrina and post-Katrina mortality rates. Methods: Pre-Katrina 2004 child mortality was estimated from death reports in the local daily newspaper and validated by comparison with pre-Katrina data from the Louisiana Department of Health. Post-Katrina child mortality rates were analyzed as a measure of health consequences. Results: Newspaper-derived estimates of mortality rates appear to be valid except for possible underreporting of neonatal rates. Pre-Katrina and post-Katrina mortality rates were similar for all age groups except infants. Post-Katrina, a 92% decline in mortality rate occurred for neonates (<28 days), and a 57% decline in mortality rate occurred for postneonatal infants ( 28 days-1 year). The post-Katrina decline in infant mortality rate exceeds the pre-Katrina discrepancy between newspaper-derived and Department of Health-reported rates. Conclusions: A declining infant mortality rate raises questions about persistent displacement of high-risk infants out of the region. Otherwise, there is no evidence of long-lasting post-Katrina excess child mortality. Further investigation of demographic changes would be of interest to local decision makers and planners for recovery after public health emergencies in other regions.

This review synthesizes emerging progress in the understanding of CDHW patterns in Brazil while providing insights about the impacts on fire occurrence and public health. Evidence is mounting that heatwaves are becoming increasingly linked with droughts in northeastern and southeastern Brazil, the Amazonia, and the Pantanal. In those regions, recent studies have begun to build a better understanding of the physical mechanisms behind CDHW events, such as the soil moisture-atmosphere coupling, promoted by exceptional atmospheric blocking conditions. Results hint at a synergy between CDHW events and high fire activity in the country over the last decades, with the most recent example being the catastrophic 2020 fires in the Pantanal. Moreover, we show that HWs were responsible for increasing mortality and preterm births during record-breaking droughts in southeastern Brazil. This work paves the way for a more in-depth understanding on CDHW events and their impacts, which is crucial to enhance the adaptive capacity of different Brazilian sectors.";"compound events; droughts; fires; health; heatwaves; REGIONAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIO-DE-JANEIRO; ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; ELDERLY MORTALITY; AIR-POLLUTION; PRETERM BIRTH; COMPOUND DRY; SAO-PAULO; WAVES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

From uranium mining and milling, to fuel manufacture, electricity generation and radioactive waste management, children in frontline and Indigenous communities can be disproportionately harmed due to often increased sensitivity of developing systems to toxic exposures, the lack of resources and racial and class discrimination. The reasons for the greater susceptibility of women and children to harm from radiation exposure is not fully understood. Regulatory practices, particularly in the establishment of protective exposure standards, have failed to take this difference into account. Anecdotal evidence within communities around nuclear facilities suggests an association between radiation exposure and increases in birth defects, miscarriages and childhood cancers. A significant number of academic studies tend to ascribe causality to other factors related to diet and lifestyle and dismiss these health indicators as statistically insignificant. In the case of a major release of radiation due to a serious nuclear accident, children are again on the frontlines, with a noted susceptibility to thyroid cancer, which has been found in significant numbers among children exposed both by the 1986 Chornobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine and the 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan. The response among authorities in Japan is to blame increased testing or to reduce testing. More independent studies are needed focused on children, especially those in vulnerable frontline and Indigenous communities. In conducting such studies, greater consideration must be applied to culturally significant traditions and habits in these communities.";"Epidemiology; Ethics; Genetics; Toxicology; IONIZING-RADIATION; CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT; YOUNG-PEOPLE; LEUKEMIA; CANCER; EXPOSURE; FUKUSHIMA; URANIUM; PLANT; HYPOTHESIS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

We systematically reviewed and assessed the strength and quality of the evidence on the relationship between drinking water with high sodium levels (> 200 mgNa/l) and adverse cardiovascular, renal, and pregnancy-related health outcomes, following the PRISMA guidelines, the ROBINS-E Cochrane tool and the Navigation Guide. From five bibliographic databases, we identified 22 relevant studies, some of which assessed more than one health domain. The evidence was of moderate quality and strength. 14 analyses from eight studies at low risk of bias and four studies at moderate risk of bias, linked drinking high-salinity water to adverse health outcomes including hypertension and cardiovascular disease, impaired renal function, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, and higher infant mortality. Eight studies were inconclusive. Three analyses, of which two at low risk of bias, associated drinking high-salinity water to improved health outcomes. Overall, our findings suggest that salinisation of drinking water sources is likely to increase adverse cardiovascular, renal, and pregnancy-related health outcomes. This conclusion highlights the importance of effective and timely adaptation at scale, and calls for a revision of the WHO guidelines for the intake of salt from water. The latest WHO guidelines (2022) do not set any health-based standard for sodium levels in drinking water, a problem that affects millions of people and will worsen with climate change.";"Climate change; Salinity; Drinking water; Cardiovascular health; Renal health; Maternal and infant health.; BLOOD-PRESSURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SODIUM; IMPACT; RISK; SALT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

We use monthly birth cohorts to determine if Japanese male births following the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 fell below levels expected from female births and from history (i.e., autocorrelation) among cohorts exposed to the Earthquake at or after conception. Methods We apply interrupted time-series methods to 69 months (i.e., April, 2006 through December, 2011) of birth data from the most and least affected prefectures as well as from the remainder of Japan. We estimate expected male births from female births and from autocorrelation. Results Findings varied by distance from the greatest damage but suggest sensitive periods both early and late in gestation when population stressors may induce selection against males in utero. Support for reduced conception of males appeared only in the prefectures most damaged by the Earthquake. Conclusions Results align with the claim that natural selection has conserved mechanisms that reduce the odds of a male live birth during stressful times by reducing the conception of males and by increasing the rate of spontaneous abortion among male fetuses.

However, Japanese evidence for labor outcomes is particularly lacking, as is the question of whether the impact of LBW on adulthood worsens when disasters occur. We aimed to reveal the impact on LBW on labor outcomes during the disaster recovery phase. Methods:We used a cross-sectional data set of 4156 national health insurance holders, males aged 40-60 years, from the Miyagi and Iwate prefectures during the earthquake recovery phase. Employing a multinomial probit and logistic model, we estimated the impact of LBW on the employment status, changes in income, and the propensity to face a decline in income with a job change. Results: The very low birth weights (VLBWs) have a disadvantage in all labor market outcomes. Compared to the non-LBWs, the VLBWs were 15.2% less likely to be full-time/self-employed and 17.1% more likely to be contingent/temporary/part-time workers. Moreover, 32.9% are more likely to face a decline in income and approximately 3.7 times more likely to change jobs leading to income decline. The LBWs were likely to face a decline in income by 8.6% and 4.6%, respectively, but no other significant effects were found on other outcomes. Conclusions: The effects were apparent for the VLBW, but not so much for the LBW.

These footprints in SIDS are associated with serious pathological changes, viz. elevated hepatic iron, bone marrow hyperplasia, hypomyelinated respiratory control centres, elevated lung immunoglobulins, cerebral hypoperfusion resembling lesions induced by chronic hypoxemia, ischemia, congenital heart disease and congenital myopathy. Hypoxia stimulates the immune response and the over-arousal of the immune response triggers a flood of NO. Adenosine triggers sleep. NO and adenosine are additive as dilators of coronary blood vessels. Blood pressure collapses. Selenium increases the activity of the enzyme ferrochelatase during incorporation of heme into cytochrome oxidase. NO binds to cytochrome oxidase, inhibiting respiration. When NO reaches dangerous levels, the cell turns on production of heme oxygenase. Heme is broken down to iron (Fe) carbon monoxide (CO) and bile pigments. NO has a huge affinity for hemoglobin which catalyses NO degradation to nitrate. Furthermore, NO is a product of smoke and SIDS incidence is higher in smoking mothers.

My earlier letter commented on the National Cancer Institute's 2020 series of papers in the October Issue of Health Physics on the impact of the Trinity Nuclear Test that was conducted on unoccupied government lands on 16 July 1945. The Journal editors requested that my response to Rice be edited and submitted as a paper to ensure adequate technical review and suggested that the article also add material summarizing the series of exchanges that were published in the Journal. This article suggests that significant differences exist between various summaries of the offsite impact of the Trinity Nuclear Test and offers that Trinity might be the largest nuclear accident in terms of the impact on uninvolved civilians who were downwind following the test. It suggests areas for further study to resolve these significant differences. It also asserts that until the estimated exposures of downwind residents are resolved and an appropriate study is made of infant deaths following the Trinity Nuclear Test, the issue of infant mortality remains an unanswered, 80-y-old question.";"accidents, nuclear; atmospheric testing; exposure, population; nuclear weapons; ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES; GENETIC-DISEASE; LIKELIHOOD; POPULATIONS; DOWNWIND; FALLOUT; SHONKA";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

During humanitarian events, the reproduction of maternal mortality figures by the media is common, and are often based on inaccurate reports. In light of such uncertainties and challenges, the aim of this article was to review and appraise the methodology and data collection tools used to measure MMR in humanitarian settings. A critical review of both grey and peer-review publications was conducted, focussing on articles published from January 1995 until December 2016. In the final review, articles that provided an estimate of MMR from a humanitarian setting were included. The assessment of study quality was based on an adapted framework for the quality of mortality studies in humanitarian settings. Overall, 13 peer-review publications and one grey publication were included in the final review. These were grouped according to settings: camp, clinic, household and census. Studies varied in their definition of MMR, and few studies objectively defined the humanitarian setting. Household-based studies were based on retrospective designs and on the recall of surviving family members. Although many studies attempted to purposively sample the populations afflicted, there was substantial evidence of selection bias; few studies were able to confirm the maternal deaths through medical certificates, or attempted to visit homes to re-inquire about deaths using verbal autopsy. The variation in methods and tools applied suggest that maternal mortality estimates are more likely to be markedly different from the true unknown level. The implications are that a standardized methodology and tools are necessary: that are consistent in definition, use a representative sample where possible, attempt to triangulate and validate data sources, and reconfirm deaths through household visits with informant interviews.";"Maternal mortality; MMR; conflict; humanitarian; humanitarian setting; methodology; methods; ARMED CONFLICT; REFUGEE; HEALTH; DEATH; OUTCOMES; PERIOD; BIRTH; CHILD; 1ST";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Following the 7.7 magnitude earthquake, extensive destruction and significant loss of life occurred across 10 provinces. This study aims to analyze the outcomes and share the surgical and radiologic algorithm applied to live, trauma-affected pregnant patients who were referred to the obstetrics and gynecology emergency department of our hospital following the earthquake. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study. The study included pregnant patients affected by the earthquake who were admitted to and/or referred to the obstetrics and gynecology emergency department of a tertiary hospital between February 6 and March 6, 2023. Demographic data, trauma-related findings, surgical details, and obstetric outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 58 pregnant earthquake victims were evaluated. The mean gestational age was 22.24 +/- 10.59 weeks. The most common obstetric complaint was pelvic pain or contractions (36.3%). Eleven patients gave birth, two via vaginal delivery and nine via cesarean section. The mean gestational age at delivery was 32.81 weeks. Curettage was performed in three patients, and hysterotomy in one patient. There were six live births and five stillbirths. In patients undergoing cesarean section, a midline incision was made. After delivery, the uterus was sutured, and intra-abdominal organs were evaluated. In cases of pelvic or other fractures, intraoperative scope devices were used. When necessary, patients were consulted by general surgery and orthopedics departments and were transferred to either the ward or the intensive care unit, depending on their clinical condition. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound has become the primary diagnostic tool for emergency evaluation in pregnant women. For earthquake victims who lack access to radiological assessment and require rapid clinical decisions, the recommended surgical approaches, particularly midline incisions, and intraoperative evaluations (such as the use of intraoperative scope after delivery) can be life-saving for both the baby and the mother.";"Earthquake; pregnancy; trauma; cesarean surgery in trauma; TRAUMA; OUTCOMES; INJURY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

I find that children, mostly, in poor countries are affected - a one standard deviation increase in the natural disaster index leads to an additional 6.77 deaths per 1000 live births in the disaster year. The impact is long lasting, extending beyond the disaster year. I provide suggestive evidence of the potential mechanisms driving these effects, namely, lower GDP and vaccination rates among children, along with an increased maternal mortality and disease incidence in low-income countries due to disasters. Using an endogenous measure of disasters based on damage records from insurance data leads to severe underestimation of the disaster impact. The results are robust to the use of mortality rates from multiple sources, different functional forms, and an extensive dynamic panel specification as well as various other tests.";"child mortality; environmental costs; natural disasters; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNDER-5 MORTALITY; MATERNAL STRESS; BIRTH OUTCOMES; FETAL ORIGINS; HEALTH; DEMOCRACY; IMPACT; GROWTH; EMPLOYMENT";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Design: Epidemiological analysis of sub-national and national surveys with related data. Setting: Data from Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe, compiled and analysed under UNICEF auspices. Subjects: Secondary data: children 0-5 years for weight-for-age; HIV prevalence data from various sources especially antenatal clinic surveillance. Results: Child nutritional status as measured by prevalence of underweight deteriorated from 2001 onwards in all countries except Lesotho, with very substantial increases in some provinces/districts (e.g. from 5 to 20% in Maputo (Mozambique, 1997-2002), 17 to 32% in Copperbelt (Zambia, 1999-2001/2) and 11 to 26% in Midlands province (Zimbabwe, 1999-2002)). Greater deterioration in underweight occurred in better-off areas. Areas with higher HIV/AIDS prevalences had (so far) lower malnutrition rates (and infant mortality rates), presumably because more modern areas - with greater reliance on trade and wage employment - have more HIV/AIDS. Areas with higher HIV/AIDS showed more deterioration in child nutrition. A significant area-level interaction was found of HIV/AIDS with the drought period, associated with particularly rapid deterioration in nutritional status. Conclusions: First, the most vulnerable may be households in more modern areas, nearer towns, to whom resources need to be directed. Second, the causes of this vulnerability need to be investigated. Third, HIV/AIDS amplifies the effect of drought on nutrition, so rapid and effective response will be crucial if drought strikes again. Fourth, expanded nutritional surveillance is now needed to monitor and respond to deteriorating trends. Finally, with or without drought, new means are needed of bringing help, comfort and assistance to the child population.";"HIV/AIDS; child nutrition; underweight; weight-for-age; drought; food security; southern Africa; Lesotho; Malawi; Mozambique; Swaziland; Zambia; Zimbabwe";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

OBJECTIVE To determine whether infants of mothers with at least 1 positive ZIKV test show differences in cognitive scores at ages 3 to 6 months and ages 9 to 12 months. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study recruited infants enrolled in existing ZIKV study cohorts associated with the Maternal-Infant Studies Center and the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium at the University of Puerto Rico and from the broader San Juan metropolitan area. The study took place at the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium at the University of Puerto Rico. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling if their mothers underwent ZIKV testing prenatally and were at the target ages during the study period. Infants who were born preterm (<36 weeks' gestational age), with low birth weight (<2500 g), or with a known genetic disorder were excluded. Infants were tested from ages 3 to 6 months or ages 9 to 12 months from May 2018 to April 2019. Data analysis was performed from March to April 2019. EXPOSURES Zika virus status was measured prenatally and in the early postnatal period using real-time polymerase chain reaction or a ZIKV IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The infants' development was assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (translated to Spanish and adapted for Puerto Rico), and assessors were blinded to each infant's ZIKV status. RESULTS A total of 65 study participants were included. The mean (SD) age of the infants at the time of cognitive testing was 8.98 (3.19) months. Most of the infants were white (55 [84.6%]) and Puerto Rican (64 [98.5%]); 38 of the infants were male (58.5%). General cognitive and domain-specific scores did not differ significantly between prenatally ZIKV-positive and ZIKV-negative infants except for receptive language score (mean difference = 5.52; t = 2.10; P = .04). Exposure to ZIKV (B = -5.69; beta = -0.26 [95% CI -11.01 to -0.36]; P = .04) and a measure of Hurricane Maria exposure (time without water, B = -0.05; beta = -0.27 [95% CI, -0.10 to -0.01]; P = .03) were both independently and significantly associated with receptive language scores after adjusting for key confounders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although infants exposed to ZIKV prenatally showed unaffected motor and visually mediated cognitive development, they did show deficits in receptive language scores. Receptive language skills were also associated with the degree of exposure to Hurricane Maria, with those who spent more time without water after the hurricane having lower receptive language scores.";"PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-9; PRENATAL MATERNAL STRESS; SPANISH VERSION; DEPRESSION; INFECTION; VALIDATION; MECHANISMS; EMPLOYMENT; PREGNANCY; OUTBREAK";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

These principles remain timely because the fundamental causes of the instability of the international monetary system are as valid today as they were in the early forties. The new supranational money would be created against domestic earning assets of the Fed and the ECB and its quantity would be demand-driven. Our proposal is not an agreement on exchange rates, which while possible is not essential to the functioning of the SBM. NICU would not hold open positions in assets denominated in national currency and consequently would not bear exchange rate risk. NICU would be more than an office recording credit and debit entries of the supranational bank money. The financial tsunami that hit the world economy in 2007-2008 provides a unique opportunity for a coordinated strategy.";"Keynes Plan; External imbalances; Exchange rates; International monetary system; Key currency; Supranational bank money";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

To delve into the effects of these disasters on livelihood and healthcare challenges, a mixed-method study was undertaken in a riverine-island near a major river of Bangladesh.Methodology Between February 15th and February 28th, 2023, a cross-sectional study was conducted on an island in Bangladesh. The quantitative method involved conducting a survey of 442 households, with a total of 2921 participants. Additionally, 10 in-depth interviews and 10 key-informant interviews were conducted using semi-structured guidelines. Qualitative interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a thematic analysis. Triangulation was employed in this study through the integration of qualitative and quantitative analysis, resulting in the presentation of findings that offer an in-depth comprehension of the phenomenon being investigated.Results River erosions and floods are common and recurring natural disasters that significantly impact the lives of the riverine island inhabitants. These disasters often disrupted their livelihoods, forced many residents to endure substandard living conditions or relocated during flood events. The island faced a low diagnostic prevalence of chronic diseases (e.g., 5.1% of adults were hypertension and 2.5% are diabetes) because of the absence of diagnostic facilities and a shortage of certified doctors. A significant number of chronic illness people in the community turned to alternative medicine sources (39.3%) such as homeopathy, Kabiraj, and Ayurvedic medicine, especially it gets increased during periods of natural disasters. Moreover, reproductive aged women revealed that 79.4% of them gave birth at home, with 6.0% of these home deliveries resulting in miscarriage or infant death. The destruction of crops, unstable job opportunities, an inadequate educational system, and a deficient healthcare delivery system exacerbated the hardships faced by the population affected by these disasters.Conclusion The failure to seek treatment for chronic diseases and undiagnosed diseases is a significant health issue among the aging adults on the island. Island residents face the challenge of establishing effective prevention strategies for the well-being of older adults especially at the period of natural disasters. It is crucial for the government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to collaborate to prevent the negative effects of floods and river erosions. This should include efforts to enhance the quality of education, healthcare services, job opportunities, and financial assistance for rebuilding homes.";"CLIMATE-CHANGE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Maternal characteristics, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and gestational weeks were obtained using questionnaires and medical records. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the relation between disaster exposure and maternal characteristics, HDP, and GDM. A structural equation model was applied to investigate the relation of disaster exposure with HDP and gestational weeks. Results: The homes of about 11% of the women were totally/mostly destroyed.

METHODS: Using birth certificate data for NY residents (n = 1660,401 births), we estimated risk of low birthweight (LBW: < 2500 g) and preterm birth (< 37 weeks) one week after September 11th versus three weeks before, and for 10 four-week intervals post-disaster versus these intervals in the two previous years. To corroborate regression results, we used time-series analysis. RESULTS: One week after September 11th in NYC, we observed an adjusted odds of 1.44 for births < 1500 g (P = 0.07) and 1.67 for births 1500-1999 g (P = 0.01), but a decreased odds of 2000-2499 g.

In extended analyses, we found, in both locations, increased odds of < 1500-g births around New Year and 33-36 weeks post-disaster and decreased odds of moderate preterm for several weeks post-disaster. Time-series analyses yielded similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: The events of September 11, 2001 in NYC were associated with immediate increases in births < 2000 g, slightly delayed decreased preterm delivery, and delayed increases in LBW among infants exposed periconception or in the first two trimesters.

Suggested measures that the Haitian government and international donor community can take to maintain these gains are also made. With the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) deadline of 2015 drawing nearer, the likelihood that Haiti will achieve MDG's 4 and 5 of reducing child and maternal mortality by two-thirds and three-quarters, respectively, by the end of this target year, remain questionable. In particular, the destruction inflicted on the country's health care system and health infrastructure by the 2010 earthquake have already resulted in a slowing of these gains and could potentially threaten an actual reversal of these trends. The country's Soins Obst,tricaux Gratuits and Soins Infantiles Gratuits schemes established in 2008 and 2010, which provide free health care to women, newborns and children under 5, represent examples of measures that will need to be sustained and scaled up if the country is to meet its MDG 4 and 5 targets. The Haitian government's endorsement of an increased continuum of care approach to maternal and newborn health will also be vital for future initiatives. Post-quake public health and social service reconstruction efforts will need to incorporate maternal and child health-friendly services into their designs. It also remains critical that international donors continue to meet their pledges to Haiti. The Haitian government should also take more strides to clearly delineate the maternal and child health interventions it implements, both in order to facilitate greater national learning, as well as to improve the likelihood of future replication.";"Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5; Child mortality; Maternal mortality; Haiti reconstruction; Donor support";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Infant and maternal mortality, preterm birth, and instances of increased developmental and physical defects are related to environmental exposures (e.g., pesticides, lead in water, wildfire smoke), dietary additives, and lack of access to adequate healthcare. More frequently people of color and other under-served groups, are affected by historical inequality and unconscious bias. Compounding these disparities, research into these issues and efforts to address them are poorly supported.MethodsThe speakers in this symposium presented evidence for health disparities within communities of color to foster research aimed at identifying toxic levels of potentially hazardous dietary chemicals, or exposures in the pediatric population can focus on addressing the current inadequacy of translating scientific findings into enforceable policies.ResultsThe disparities discussed within this symposium highlighted key areas in desperate need of policy reform. In the United States, regulatory exposure levels have been established for lead exposures but frequently exceed these limits without mitigation. Neural tube defects can be prevented by a simple dietary solution such as fortification of staple foods with folic acid. Recent literature on gender as a social determinant of health has determined women suffer more negative health consequences due to social attitudes.ConclusionsUltimately, this symposium provided an understanding of the experience of disadvantaged and marginalized persons during pregnancy, illustrated the disparities that exist in reproductive health, and described the need to address and prevent them.";"folic acid; health disparities; lead; maternal and pediatric health; people of color; NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS; THYROID-FUNCTION; EXPOSURE; CHILDREN; DISORDERS; PREGNANCY; CHEMICALS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Ambient pollutant concentrations, emission sources, baseline health conditions, and population sizes and distributions are all important factors that need to be taken into account to quantify local health burdens. Objectives: To determine health impacts from ambient air pollution concentrations in the United States that exceed the levels recommended by the American Thoracic Society. Methods: Using a methodology that has been well established in previous ""Health of the Air"" reports, this study provides policyrelevant estimates for every monitored county and city in the United States for the adverse health impacts of outdoor pollution concentrations using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency design values for years 2018-2020. Additionally, for the first time, the report includes adverse birth outcomes as well as estimates of health impacts specifically attributable to wildland fires using an exposure dataset generated through CommunityMultiscale Air Quality simulations. Results: The adverse health burdens attributable to air pollution occur across the entire age spectrum, including adverse birth outcomes (10,660 preterm and/or low-weight births; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3,180-18,330), in addition to mortality impacts (21,300 avoidable deaths; 95% CI, 16,180-26,200), lung cancer incidence (3,000 new cases; 95% CI, 1,550-4,390), multiple types of cardiovascular and respiratorymorbidity (748,660 events; 95% CI, 326,050-1,057,080), and adversely impacted days (52.4million days; 95% CI, 7.9-92.4million days). Two different estimates of mortality impacts fromwildland fires were created based on assumptions regarding the underlying toxicity of particles fromwildland fires (low estimate of 4,080 deaths, 95% CI, 240-7,890; middle estimate of 28,000 deaths, 95% CI, 27,300-28,700). Conclusions: This year's report identified sizable health benefits that would be expected to occur across the United States with compliance with more health-protective air quality standards such as those recommended by the American Thoracic Society. This study also indicates that a large number of excess deaths are attributable to emissions from wildland fires; air quality management strategies outside what is required by the Clean Air Act will be needed to best address this important source of air pollution and its associated health risks.";"air pollution; environmental policy; pregnancy outcome; risk assessment; wildfires; AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY; PRETERM BIRTH; RECOMMENDED STANDARDS; MATERNAL EXPOSURE; EXCESS MORBIDITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MORTALITY; WILDFIRE; OZONE; DISPARITIES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

A revealing measure of the extent of such global problems is that more than half of the hospital beds in the world today are occupied by people with water-related diseases. Addressing these issues mandates an interdisciplinary approach by the world's scientific and engineering community. In this spirit a workshop was held in Phoenix to provide a forum where epidemiologists, hydraulics researchers and other stakeholders of varied backgrounds (e.g., policy makers, environmental groups etc.) could all participate in a debate on a future agenda for hydro-epidemiology.

For the case of Costa Rica, no sub-national climate vulnerability index exists to date. To fill this gap, we constructed a climate vulnerability index at the canton level. We ground our work in the conceptual framework that vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Making extensive use of geographic information systems and publicly available data, we constructed 13 spatial layers to reflect the multi-dimensionality of vulnerability. Layers reflect for example, changes in climatic extremes, flood risk, vegetation cover, access to infrastructure (road density) and health services (distance to hospitals), as well as various socioeconomic (wealth level, employment rates, remittances, literacy rate) and demographic (infant mortality) characteristics. Following normalization, we constructed an inverse variance weighted index of canton-level climate vulnerability. We confirmed the validity of our climate vulnerability index through correlation with disaster damage data. We find the strongest climate vulnerability not only in the rural, agricultural producing border cantons (Los Chiles, Matina, Talamanca, Buenos Aires), but also for a few central urban cantons (Tibas, San Jose). Projects and interventions in these hot spot cantons may reduce sensitivity through strengthening hydrological infrastructure and economic development, while adaptive capacity may be improved through addressing barriers of remittance transfer, and via public health programs.";"Climate Vulnerability; Vulnerability Mapping; Sub-national; Climate Change Index; Climate Risk; Costa Rica; FOOD SECURITY; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CHANGE IMPACTS; EL-NINO; ADAPTATION; MIGRATION; DROUGHT; SYSTEMS; PERSPECTIVE; VARIABILITY";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Many factors have contributed to Sri Lanka's success story. A political commitment to the cause and implementation of clear policies through well-structured and organized community-based and institutional healthcare services-expanded to cover the whole country and provided free of charge-have been the foundation of maternal and child health (MCH) services in the country. The healthcare programs have been well accepted and utilized by the people as the literacy rate is more than 90% for both men and women. Public health midwives form the backbone of MCH services and provide frontline reproductive health care. More than 98% of deliveries occur in hospitals and are attended by midwives. Furthermore, 85% of women in Sri Lanka deliver in facilities served by specialist obstetricians/gynecologists. The Sri Lanka College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists plays a leading role by assisting the Family Health Bureau in making policies and guidelines, training staff, and acting as team leaders for maternity care services. This was evident after the tsunami in December 2004. National maternal mortality reviews, monitoring and evaluation of MCH activities, and relatively high contraceptive prevalence rates have also contributed to the success in Sri Lanka, which could serve as a model for other countries.

WTC dust was found to consist predominantly (95%) of coarse particles and contained pulverized cement, glass fibers, asbestos, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polychlorinated furans and dioxins. Airborne particulate levels were highest immediately after the attack and declined thereafter. Particulate levels decreased sharply with distance from the WTC. Dust pH was highly alkaline (pH 9.0-11.0). Mice exposed to WTC dust showed only moderate pulmonary inflammation but marked bronchial hyperractivity. Evaluation of 10,116 firefighters showed exposure-related. P increases in cough and bronchial hyperreactivity. Evaluation of 183 cleanup workers showed new-onset cough (33%), wheeze (18%), and phlegm production (24%). Increased frequency of new-onset cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath were also observed in community residents. Follow-up of 182 pregnant women who were either inside or near the WTC on I I September showed a 2-fold increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. In summary, environmental exposures after the WTC disaster were associated with significant adverse effects on health. The high alkalinity of WTC dust produced bronchial hyperreactivity, persistent cough, and increased risk of asthma. Plausible causes of the observed increase in SGA infants include maternal exposures to PAH and particulates.

However, the burden of stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM2.5 is unknown. In low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is a co-occurrence of high baseline stillbirth rates and frequent firestorms, which may lead to a geographic disparity. Across 54 LMICs, we conducted a self-matched case-control study, making stillbirths comparable to the corresponding livebirths in terms of time-invariant characteristics (e. g., genetics) and duration of gestational exposure. We established a joint-exposure-response function (JERF) by simultaneously associating stillbirth with fire-and non-fire-sourced PM2.5 concentrations, which were estimated by fusing multi-source data, such as chemical transport model simulations and satellite observations. During 2000-2014, 35,590 pregnancies were selected from multiple Demographic and Health Surveys. In each mother, a case of stillbirth was compared to her livebirth(s) based on gestational exposure to fire-sourced PM2.5. We further applied the JERF to assess stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM2.5 in 136 non-Western countries. The disparity was evaluated using the Gini index. The risk of stillbirth increased by 17.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-35.7%) per 10 & mu;g/m3 increase in fire-sourced PM2.5.

Three of the eight Millennium Development Goals are directly related to reproductive and sexual health while mental disorders make up three of the ten leading causes of disease burden in low and middle-income countries. Among mental disorders, depression and anxiety are two of the most prevalent. In the context of slower progress in achieving Millennium Development Goals in developing countries and the ever-increasing man-made and natural disasters in these areas, it is important to understand the association between reproductive health and mental health among women with post-disaster experiences. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with a sample of 387 women of reproductive age (15-49 years) randomly selected from the October 2005 earthquake affected areas of Pakistan. Data on reproductive health was collected using the Centers for Disease Control reproductive health assessment toolkit. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, while earthquake experiences were captured using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. The association of either depression or anxiety with socio-demographic variables, earthquake experiences, reproductive health and access to health facilities was estimated using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Post-earthquake reproductive health events together with economic deprivation, lower family support and poorer access to health care facilities explained a significant proportion of differences in the experiencing of clinical levels of depression and anxiety. For instance, women losing resources for subsistence, separation from family and experiencing reproductive health events such as having a stillbirth, having had an abortion, having had abnormal vaginal discharge or having had genital ulcers, were at significant risk of depression and anxiety. Conclusion: The relationship between women's post-earthquake mental health and reproductive health, socio-economic status, and health care access is complex and explained largely by the socio-cultural role of women.

With growing evidence that treating maternal first trimester primary cytomegalovirus infections with valacyclovir reduces vertical transmission, universal screening may become an important tool in congenital cytomegalovirus prevention. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the cost-effectiveness of a universal screening approach for maternal cytomegalovirus in the first trimester of pregnancy followed by valacyclovir treatment in positive cases for prevention of the sequelae of congenital cytomegalovirus. STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare outcomes of universal screening and subsequent valacyclovir treatment in a theoretical cohort of 2,869,141 individuals, the estimated number of pregnant people in the United States who receive prenatal care by the first trimester. Individuals found to be immunoglobulin G positive, immunoglobulin M positive, and to have low immunoglobulin G avidity were considered to have primary cytomegalovirus infection and received valacyclovir. Outcomes included cases of vertical cytomegalovirus transmission, abortions, stillbirths, neonatal deaths, cases of hearing loss, cases of neurodevelopmental disabilities, costs, and quality-adjusted life years. Model inputs were derived from literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed via tornado analysis, univariable sensitivity analysis, and multivariable sensitivity analysis with Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: In our study, universal screening in the first trimester for primary cytomegalovirus and subsequent treatment with valacyclovir positive cases decreased adverse outcomes by preventing 2898 vertical transmissions, 94 abortions, 19 stillbirths, 11 neonatal deaths, 460 cases of hearing loss, and 263 cases of neurodevelopmental disability. Universal screening and subsequent treatment was the dominant strategy as saved 242.2 million dollars and led to 3437 additional quality-adjusted life years. Tornado analysis demonstrated that there were no threshold values which would change the model results, when all variables were varied across a predetermined range. Univariable sensitivity analyses demonstrated that even with decreasing specificity of screening tests, decreasing maternal utility of neonatal hearing loss, and increasing the price screening up to 17 times the current cost, universal screening remained the cost-effective strategy. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrated that the screening strategy remained cost-saving in 100% of trials. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that screening for first trimester primary cytomegalovirus may be a cost-saving intervention, identification of cases allows for the provision of treatment, which in turn reduces vertical cytomegalovirus transmission and costly sequelae.";"congenital infections; infectious disease; preventive health; public health; screening; INFECTION; PREGNANCY; VALACICLOVIR; TRANSMISSION; DIAGNOSIS; SEQUELAE; RISK";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The knowledge of the impact of climate change on health is expanding rapidly. However, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the impact of climate change on the interlinked pregnancy, perinatal and infant periods. Hence, the objective of this study was to provide an overview of the effects of changing weather and climate hazards on maternal and infant health during pregnancy, the perinatal period and infancy.Methods We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed original articles and reviews found in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, Global Health and WHO regional databases on the subject between January 2000 and May 2025. The included articles were in the English language, detailed exposure to climate change hazards during pregnancy, the perinatal period and up to 1 year of age in the child, with an outcome related to health.Results In total, 596 reviews and original articles were included in the analysis. Our findings demonstrate large differences in the number and types of studies for each climate-related hazard. Direct health effects from rising temperatures and extreme weather events, as well as indirect health effects such as infectious diseases, food insecurity, forced migration and socioeconomic changes due to climate change, have clear negative consequences for pregnant women and infants.Conclusions There is a large evidence base showcasing the harmful impact of climate change on pregnant women and infants through a variety of pathways. Action is urgently needed at all levels to address climate change and there is a need to implement large-scale mitigation and adaptation efforts that protect the health and well-being of pregnant women and infants everywhere.";"Infant; Child Health; Health Policy; Endocrinology; MATERNAL EXPOSURE; PRETERM BIRTH; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; DISASTER EXPOSURE; CHILD HEALTH; OUTCOMES; DROUGHT; FLOOD; HEAT; DEPRESSION";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

A further misconception was to totalize both Schreber as person and the content of his book as psychotic, controverted by the fact that Schreber recovered by 1897 and the book is a creative essay with a profound moral message. Schreber's hermaphroditic fantasies were neither homosexual desires toward psychiatrist Flechsig nor morbid delusions but images of an identification with or compassion for his wife who suffered repeated miscarriages and stillbirths.

In contrast to some cooperative breeders, subordinate female meerkats are physiologically able to reproduce and occasionally do so successfully; their attempts are more frequently 'suppressed' via eviction or infanticide by the dominant female. Spontaneous abortion and neonatal loss occur with some regularity, further negatively impacting reproductive success. Here, we compared the reproductive outcomes and endocrine profiles, including of serum progesterone (P-4), serum estradiol (E-2), and fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCm), of dominant and subordinate dams residing within their clans in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa. Our study spanned years of drought, which reduced insect abundance and represented a substantial environmental stressor. Meerkat pregnancies were identified at mid-term and culminated either in spontaneous abortions or full-term deliveries, after which pups were either lost prior to emergence from the natal den (usually within 2 days of birth) or emerged at 2-3 weeks. Neonatal loss exceeded fetal loss for all females, and contributed to narrowing the status-related disparity in female reproductive output seen during less arid periods. Although E-2 concentrations were significantly lower in subordinate than dominant females, they were sufficient to support gestation. Absolute E-2 concentrations may owe to androgenic precursors that also attain highest concentrations in dominant dams and may mediate aggression underlying female reproductive skew. Pregnancies terminating in fetal loss were marked by significantly lower 134 concentrations in mid-gestation and modestly lower E-2 concentrations overall. Consistently high fGCm concentrations further increased across trimesters, particularly (but not consistently) in subordinates and in aborted pregnancies. Environmental stressor may modulate reproductive outcomes in meerkats through their influence on sex steroids and their effects on intragroup competition. The social and eco-physiological factors affecting intraspecific variation in reproductive output, even in obligate cooperative breeders, may be most apparent during extreme conditions, reflecting the benefits of long-term studies for assessing the impact of climate change.";"Cooperative breeding; Social dominance; Reproductive and stress hormones; Fetal and neonatal mortality; Reproductive success; Climate change; FECAL GLUCOCORTICOID LEVELS; EARLY FETAL LOSS; LONG-TERM FIELD; SURICATA-SURICATTA; SUBORDINATE REPRODUCTION; PHYSIOLOGICAL SUPPRESSION; TRIGGERED ABORTION; SEXUAL SELECTION; PRENATAL STRESS; HEAT-STRESS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Methods Preschool children (n = 163, mean age = 3.19, 85.5% racial and ethnic minorities) and their parents (n = 151) were evaluated annually at ages 2-5 to assess the emergence of psychopathology using the Preschool Age Psychopathological Assessment (PAPA), a parent-report structured diagnostic interview developed for preschool-age children. Sixty-six (40.5%) children were exposed to Sandy Storm (SS) in utero and 97 (59.5%) were not. Survival analysis evaluated patterns of onset and estimated cumulative risks of psychopathology among exposed and unexposed children, in total and by sex. Analyses were controlled for the severity of objective and subjective SS-related stress, concurrent family stress, and demographic and psychosocial confounders, such as maternal age, race, SES, maternal substance use, and normative prenatal stress. Results Exposure to SS in utero was associated with a substantial increase in depressive disorders (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 16.9, p = .030), anxiety disorders (HR = 5.1, p < .0001), and attention-deficit/disruptive behavioral disorders (HR = 3.4, p = .02). Diagnostic rates were elevated for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; HR = 8.5, p = .004), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; HR = 5.5, p = .01), oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD; HR = 3.8, p = .05), and separation-anxiety disorder (SAD; HR = 3.5, p = .001).

Conclusions The findings demonstrate that in utero exposure to a major weather-related disaster (SS) was associated with increased risk for psychopathology in children and provided evidence of distinct psychopathological outcomes as a function of sex.

Common indicators are elevated concentrations of nutrients such as nitrate and faecal bacteria. The high infant mortality can at least partially be attributed to the insufficient water hygiene.

Contextual, locally driven data are required to elucidate country needs, develop effective interventions, and guide policy decisions. Objective: We employ qualitative methodology to describe barriers faced and solutions proposed by front-line obstetric providers in Bihar - a poor, populous Indian state where maternal mortality exceeds the national average. We aim to make locally driven recommendations for ongoing policy work in India to strengthen the country's blood transfusion system. Methods: From February to May 2016, two researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 obstetric providers across Bihar. Snowball sampling was employed until thematic saturation was reached. Following immersion into de-identified texts and dual codebook development, a primary analyst completed topical coding, and a secondary analyst confirmed reproducibility. Results: Providers report that pervasive banked blood shortages force hospitals to require replacement donation, but patients' families often cannot or will not donate. Providers wait one to six hours for blood, depending on availability of staff and supplies, blood bank proximity, and the ability of the patient being treated to navigate the system. Providers feel forced to refer their patients, often to distant, poorly equipped centers. Providers identify donor education, improved infrastructure, and improved local coordination as focus areas for intervention. Conclusions: A multi-stakeholder approach that aims to increase blood donation through community education, mitigate limited infrastructure through short-term workarounds, and improve local-level coordination through state support and policy change is required in Bihar.

Using 30 years of data on wild olive baboons (Papio anubis) in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, we found evidence that rapidly-rising immigrant males induced miscarriages in high-ranking females outside of drought conditions. However, miscarriage rates were largely reversed during prolonged periods of low rainfall, suggesting that low-ranking females are particularly vulnerable to low food availability and social instability.

Although increased vasopressinase is associated with placental volume, the regulation of placental growth in the later stage of pregnancy is not well known. Case presentation: A 16-year-old pregnant woman was urgently transferred to our hospital because of threatened premature labor when the Kumamoto earthquakes hit the area where she lived. During her hospitalization, she complained of gradually increasing symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia. The serum level of arginine vasopressin (AVP) was 1.7 pg/mL, which is inconsistent with central DI. The challenge of diagnostic treatment using oral 1-deamino-8-D-AVP (DDAVP) successfully controlled her urine and allowed for normal delivery. DDAVP tablets were not necessary to control her polyuria thereafter. Based on these observations, clinical diagnosis of GDI was confirmed. Pathophysiological analyses revealed that vasopressinase expression was more abundant in the GDI patient's syncytiotrophoblast in placenta compared with that in a control subject. Serum vasopressinase was also observed during gestation and disappeared soon after delivery. Vasopressinase is reportedly identical to oxytocinase or insulin regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), which is an abundant cargo protein associated with the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) storage vesicle. Interestingly, the expression and subcellular localization of GLUT4 appeared to occur in a vasopressinase (IRAP)-dependent manner. Conclusion: Because placental volume may be associated with vasopressinase overproduction in GDI, vasopressinase (IRAP)/GLUT4 association appears to contribute to the growth of placenta in this case.";"Gestational diabetes insipidus; Vasopressinase (=insulin regulated aminopeptidase: IRAP); Glucose transporter 4; PREGNANCY; AMINOPEPTIDASE; GLUT4; PLACENTA";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Instead, economic development, famine, short-lasting Finnish civil war and total mortality rate were not related to birth sex ratio. Moreover, we found no association between annual birth sex ratio and sex-biased infant mortality rate among the concurrent cohort. Our results propose that some exogenous challenges like ambient temperature and war can skew human birth sex ratio and that these deviations likely represent environmental forcing rather than adaptive parental response to such challenges.";"economics; infant mortality; natural selection; temperature; time-series analysis; war; OFFSPRING SEX; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; BOVINE EMBRYOS; HEAT-STRESS; REPRODUCTION; POPULATION; MORTALITY; SONS; LIFE; EARTHQUAKE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Both animal and human studies have found that prenatal maternal stress affects the brain and behavior of the offspring. Stressful life events, exposure to a natural disaster, and symptoms of maternal anxiety and depression increase the risk for the child having a range of emotional, behavioral and/or cognitive problems in later life. These include depression, anxiety, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and/or conduct disorders. There is an increased risk for other outcomes also, including preterm delivery and reduced telomere length, possibly indicative of an accelerated life history. The causal role of prenatal maternal stress on the etiology of the neurodevelopmental disorders is supported by large population cohorts, which have controlled for a wide range of potential confounders, including postnatal maternal mood. More recently, research has begun to explore the biological correlates and mediators of these findings. These studies suggest that the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis plays a role inmediating the effects of maternal stress on the fetal brain. Further, in vivo brain imaging research reports that maternal stress is associated with changes in limbic and frontotemporal networks, and the functional and microstructural connections linking them. The structural changes include cortical thinning and an enlarged amygdala. While these studies have been conducted on smaller sample sizes and could not control for many confounders, the observed brain changes do plausibly underlie many of the emotional, behavioral and cognitive changes found to be associated with prenatal stress.";"MATERNAL DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; AMYGDALA FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTICAL THICKNESS; PREGNANCY ANXIETY; WHITE-MATTER; EXPOSURE; DISORDER; MICROSTRUCTURE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; CONSEQUENCES";"";"";"";"";"English";"CHAP";""

It remains unclear whether this decline results from an excess of male fetal loss or reduced male conceptions. The literature also does not converge as to whether the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 induced ""communal bereavement"", or the widespread feeling of distress among persons who never met those directly involved in the attacks. We test the communal bereavement hypothesis among gravid women by examining whether male fetal deaths rose above expected levels in the US following September 11, 2001. Methods: We apply interrupted time-series methods to all fetal deaths at or greater than the 20(th) week of gestation in the US from 1996 to 2002. Time-series methods control for trends, seasonality, and other forms of autocorrelation that could induce spurious associations. Results: Results support the hypothesis in that the fetal death sex ratio (i.e., the odds of a male fetal death) increased above its expected value in September 2001. Additional analysis of the secondary sex ratio indirectly supports that the terrorist attacks may have threatened the gestation of male more than female fetuses. Conclusions: Societal responses to events such as September 11, 2001 do not appear confined only to persons who have ever met the deceased. The fetal death sex ratio in the US population may serve as a sentinel indicator of the degree to which pregnant women react to population stressors.";"SEX-RATIO; STRESS; BIRTH; TIME; GLUCOCORTICOIDS; EARTHQUAKE; LIFE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The introduction of fetal ultrasound allowed the diagnosis of other congenital anomalies, some being amenable to fetal interventions. Open fetal surgical procedures were initially utilised, with significant maternal morbidity. For some anomalies, percutaneous approaches became favoured. In general, all of these procedures involved significant risks to the mother, to save a baby that was likely to die before or shortly after birth without fetal intervention.

In this review, we aimed to describe the current landscape of available epidemiological evidence on key climate risks on maternal and newborn health (MNH). Methods We sought to identify published systematic and scoping reviews investigating the impact of different climate hazards and air pollution on MNH outcomes. With this in mind, we developed a systematic search strategy based on the concepts of 'climate/air pollution hazards, 'maternal health,' and 'newborn health,' with restrictions to reviews published between 1 January 2010 and 6 February 2023, but without geographical or language restriction. Following full text screening and data extraction, we synthesised the results using narrative synthesis. Results We found 79 reviews investigating the effects of climate hazards on MNH, mainly focussing on outdoor air pollution (n = 47, 59%), heat (n = 24, 30%), and flood/ storm disasters (n = 7, 9%). Most were published after 2015 (n = 60, 76%). These reviews had consistent findings regarding the positive association of exposure to heat and to air pollution with adverse birth outcomes, particularly preterm birth. We found limited evidence for impacts of climate-related food and water security on MNH and did not identify any reviews on climate-sensitive infectious diseases and MNH. Conclusions Climate change could undermine recent improvements in maternal and newborn health. Our review provides an overview of key climate risks to MNH. It could therefore be useful to the MNH community to better understand the MNH needs for each climate hazard and to strengthen discussions on evidence and research gaps and potential actions. Despite the lack of comprehensive evidence for some climate hazards and for many maternal, perinatal, and newborn outcomes, we observed repeated findings of the impact of heat and air pollutants on birth outcomes, particularly preterm birth.

Immunohistochemical and autoradiographic data demonstrate a constellation of serotonergic defects in the caudal raphe nuclei in infants who died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The purpose of this review is to synthesize what is known about adaptive responses of the infant to severely hypoxic conditions, which unleash a flood of neuromodulators that inhibit cardiorespiratory function, thermogenesis, and arousal and the emerging role of serotonin, which combats this cardiorespiratory inhibition to foster autoresuscitation, eupnea, and arousal to ensure survival following an hypoxic episode. The laryngeal and carotid body chemoreflexes are potent in newborns and infants, and both reflexes can induce apnea and bradycardia, which may be adaptive initially, but must be terminated if an infant is to survive. Serotonin has a unique ability to touch on each of the processes that may be required to recover from hypoxic reflex apnea: gasping, the restoration of heart rate and blood pressure, termination of apneas and, eventually, stimulation of eupnea and arousal. Recurrent apneic events, bradycardia, ineffective gasping and a failure to terminate apneas and restore eupnea are observed in animals harboring defects in the caudal serotonergic system models - all of these phenotypes are reminiscent of and compatible with the cardiorespiratory recordings made in infants who subsequently died of SIDS. The caudal serotonergic system provides an organized, multi-pronged defense against reflex cardiorespiratory inhibition and the hypoxia that accompanies prolonged apnea, bradycardia and hypotension, and any deficiency of caudal serotonergic function will increase the propensity for sudden unexplained infant death.";"Sudden infant death syndrome; Arousal; 5-HT; Caudal raphe; Autoresuscitation; Apnea; Adenosine; Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA); Autonomic neuroscience; ADENOSINE A(2A) RECEPTORS; HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; LARYNGEAL NERVE-STIMULATION; NUCLEUS RAPHE OBSCURUS; CAROTID-BODY; ARTERIAL CHEMORECEPTORS; MEDIATED MODULATION; INTERMITTENT HYPOXIA; MEDULLA-OBLONGATA; AROUSAL RESPONSES";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) scores and parent-reported language abilities of 58 toddlers of mothers who were exposed to varying levels of prenatal stress were obtained at 2 y of age. The hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that the toddlers' birth weight and age at testing accounted for 12.0% and 14.8% of the variance in the Bayley MDI scores and in productive language abilities, respectively. More importantly, the level of prenatal stress exposure accounted for an additional 11.4% and 12.1% of the variance in the toddlers' Bayley MDI and productive language abilities and uniquely accounted for 17.3% of the variance of their receptive language abilities. The more severe the level of prenatal stress exposure, the poorer the toddlers' abilities. The level of prenatal stress exposure accounted for a Significant proportion of the variance in the three dependent variables above and beyond that already accounted for by non-ice storm-related factors.

The objectives of this study were to report the rate of breastfeeding initiation within 1hour of birth in Jiangyou, China, to determine its impact on full breastfeeding at discharge, and to investigate factors associated with early breastfeeding initiation. Methods A prospective cohort study of infant feeding practices was undertaken during 2010 and 2011 in Jiangyou, 2years after an earthquake caused extensive damage. A total of 695 mothers were recruited from hospitals and health centers and interviewed at discharge. Results In this study, 9.1 percent of women began breastfeeding within 1hour postpartum. Mothers who initiated breastfeeding early were more likely to be fully breastfeeding at discharge (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.23-3.60). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that giving birth at a health center was associated with delayed breastfeeding initiation (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.04-0.32), whereas attending antenatal classes (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.36-4.87) and receiving encouragement from hospital staff to initiate breastfeeding (OR 5.60, 95% CI 2.31-13.55) were correlated with putting the baby to the breast soon after delivery. Conclusions Early breastfeeding initiation rate was low and the use of prelacteal foods was widespread in Jiangyou. Early breastfeeding initiation was associated with higher full breastfeeding rates at discharge. It is important to educate doctors and nurses to assist mothers with early breastfeeding initiation and to discourage the use of non-breastmilk prelacteal feeds.

Methods: A cross-sectional household survey was conducted in August 2004. 402 women of reproductive age (15-50) were interviewed regarding their pregnancy history, access to and utilization of health care, and infant and child health care practices. Results: Women's access to education was low at 15% for any formal schooling; adult female literacy was <20%. One third of women received any antenatal care during their last pregnancy. Institutional delivery and skilled birth attendance were <1%, and there were no reported cesarean deliveries. Birth was commonly attended by a female relative, and 8% of women delivered alone. Use of unsterilized instrument to cut the umbilical cord was nearly universal (94%), while coverage for tetanus toxoid immunization was only 14%. Traditional Tibetan healers were frequently sought for problems during pregnancy (70%), the postpartum period (87%), and for childhood illnesses (74%). Western medicine (61%) was preferred over Tibetan medicine (9%) for preventive antenatal care. The average time to reach a health facility was 4.3 hours. Postpartum infectious morbidity appeared to be high, but only 3% of women with postpartum problems received western medical care. 64% of recently pregnant women reported that they were very worried about dying in childbirth. The community reported 3 maternal deaths and 103 live births in the 19 months prior to the survey. Conclusions: While China is on track to achieve national Millennium Development Goal targets for maternal and child health, women and children in Surmang suffer from substantial health inequities in access to antenatal, skilled birth and postpartum care. Institutional delivery, skilled attendance and cesarean delivery are virtually inaccessible, and consequently maternal and infant morbidity and mortality are likely high. Urgent action is needed to improve access to maternal, neonatal and child health care in these marginalized populations.

The ease of transmission of a disease with a 50% mortality rate for those once infected raises particular challenges for breast-feeding women. This systematic review explored the attitudes and preferences of pregnant women, mothers, family members, health practitioners and policy makers concerning infant feeding during an Ebola epidemic as documented in qualitative studies. Participants reported confusion and inconsistent guidance regarding breast-feeding practice, together with difficulties in conveying recommendations to separate mothers infected with Ebola from their breast-feeding infants. Disruption impacted on access to supplementary and complementary feeds, health systems monitoring child growth and support to child health. Widespread distrust and suspicion of health professionals hindered health care provision. Wider family assumed roles in feeding and caring for young children, within the context of reduced access to nutritious foods and supplementary feeds. The work of humanitarian agencies, while valuable, lacked coordination. Planning for an Ebola outbreak requires advance preparation of health messaging for mothers and caregivers, coordinated provision of complementary feeds and support for families who assume caring responsibilities. Strategies to ensure linked up working between government and humanitarian agencies are essential. BackgroundBreast-feeding holds considerable potential to reduce infant mortality. Feeding choices, already complex, take on additional complexity against a backdrop of the risk of transmissible Ebola Virus. This review describes the factors that influence infant feeding and attitudes of pregnant women, mothers, family members and health practitioners, policy makers and providers (midwives) concerning infant feeding when there is a risk of Mother-to-Child (MTC) transmission of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD).

Principal findings5219 references were screened. 38 references related specifically to Ebola, and five papers met the inclusion criteria with data gathered from two settings: Guinea and Sierra Leone. The EVD outbreak had a significant impact on beliefs, attitudes, and resources to support infant feeding practices negatively affecting the nutritional status of children. The evidence from these studies highlight the need for guidance and appropriate psychosocial support need to be available to mothers who display symptoms and become infected and to front-line staff who are giving advice. Communities need to be engaged because stigma and fear may hinder uptake of appropriate interventions. The EVD outbreak caused multi-level system disruption akin to that seen following a natural disaster, meaning that logistics and coordination are critical and need adequate resourcing. Food production and distribution, and malnutrition screening are also disrupted and thereby compounding compromised nutritional status. The limited number of relevant studies highlights the need for further primary research, particularly in translation of messages to local settings. ConclusionsAn EVD outbreak causes multi-level disruption that negatively impacts infant feeding and child care practices. Negative impacts have multiple causes and successful planning for Ebola outbreaks requires that nutrition of infants and young children is a priority. Lessons from the Ebola pandemic have wider applicability to other pandemic contexts including Covid-19.";"HEALTH; OUTBREAK; IMPACT; CARE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

The broad range of the speech and language therapy profession's scope of practice incorporates prevention, advocacy and equality in service delivery. These act as a springboard for involvement in climate change and health. Aims This is an appeal to speech and language therapists (SLTs) to focus and take action on this issue and its considerable effects on communication and swallowing disorders. Methods & Procedures This article discusses the importance of taking a public health position on prevention and equality of services to manage environmental determinants of communication and swallowing disorders. It also describes the extent to which climate change affects these disorders and exacerbates the inequality of healthcare services in low- and middle-income countries. Main Contribution Five strategies are provided for action on fulfilling therapists' roles in reducing the incidence, development and exacerbation of climate-related communication and swallowing disorders, as well as the role of SLTs in acting as advocates. The case is made for expanding the scope of services to focus on prevention and service equality so as to best meet the needs of the wider community. Conclusions & Implications Despite other challenges currently facing SLTs, climate change and its increasing effects on communication disorders and dysphagia is difficult to ignore. SLTs owe it to their clients, the wider community, low- and middle-income countries, the economy, and the future to take action. What this paper adds What this paper adds to existing knowledgeWhat is already known on the subject What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that climate change is extremely likely to be due to human activities. The global effects will be higher temperatures, changes in precipitation, more droughts and heatwaves, stronger and more intense hurricanes, and a rising sea level which directly threaten the health of entire populations. Other health professions are beginning to take climate change into account in training and practice. Many disorders of communication and swallowing are caused or exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Increasing temperatures, extremes of precipitation, population displacement and air pollution contribute to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, respiratory disease, malnutrition, premature birth, air- and water-borne diseases, and mental illness. These may affect the communication and swallowing abilities across the lifespan, but particularly those of children and older adults. SLTs' roles in prevention, advocacy and education act as a starting point for involvement in climate change and health. Three practical strategies for action include educating SLTs and other health professionals on climate change and its effects on communication and swallowing, promoting awareness with clients and their families, and gathering and disseminating reliable data.";"advocacy; prevention; climate change; equality of services; scope of practice; public health; HEALTH-CARE; NATURAL DISASTERS; COMMUNICATION DISABILITY; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; RECURRENT STROKE; WORLD REPORT; RISK; PEOPLE; CANCER";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Methods: Here, we present a sibling-matched case-control study of 227,948 newborns to identify an association between fire-sourced fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and birthweight in 54 LMICs from 2000 to 2014. We selected mothers from the geocoded Demographic and Health Survey with at least two children and valid birthweight records. Newborns affiliated with the same mother were defined as a family group. Gestational exposure to LFS was assessed in each newborn using the concentration of fire-sourced PM2.5. We determined the associations of the within-group variations in LFS exposure with birthweight differences between matched siblings using a fixed-effects regression model. Additionally, we analyzed the binary outcomes of low birthweight (LBW) or very low birthweight (VLBW). Results: According to fully adjusted models, a 1 mu g/m(3) increase in the concentration of fire-sourced PM2.5 was significantly associated with a 2.17 g (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-3.77) reduction in birthweight, a 2.80% (95% CI 0.97-4.66) increase in LBW risk, and an 11.68% (95% CI 3.59-20.40) increase in VLBW risk.

No significant difference was found in population size over the study period, though a marked decline in the population occurred following a 2-year drought. The population rebounded rapidly after the immediate postdrought period. There was nearly a complete replacement of individuals over the study period. Average group size is 11.5 animals, and adult male to female sex ratio is 0.92. Most females reproduce annually, and the average fecundity rate is 84.3%. The greatest variability in fecundity is found among old females. We suggest that ring-tailed lemur females follow an ""income breeding"" strategy, i.e., females use maximum resources during reproduction rather than relying on fat stores, as do ""capital breeders."" Infant mortality to 1 year of age in a nondrought year is 52%, higher than infant mortality in small to medium-sized anthropoids. The oldest known female was 18 years old in 2001. We suggest that 18-20 years may represent the maximum life-span for wild ring-tailed lemurs. Because males regularly emigrate from the population, we have no data regarding male life-span; however, there is some indication that males do not survive as long as females. Group fission has occurred three times: twice from one parent group living in the driest area of the reserve, with the most dispersed food resources. We suggest that the reproductive strategy that has evolved in this species, wherein females reproduce early in life and annually until old age, is a response to the unusual climate and environmental conditions under which Lemur catta has evolved.

Following the 2010 earthquake, Midwives for Haiti received requests to expand services and numerous professional midwives answered the call to volunteer. This author was one of those volunteers. The purpose of the study was: 1) to develop a description of the program's strengths and its deficits in order to determine if there was a need to improve the preparation of volunteers prior to service and 2) to make recommendations aimed at strengthening the volunteers' contributions to the education of Haiti and auxiliary midwives. MethodsThree distinct but closely related questionnaires were developed to survey Haitian students, staff midwives, and volunteers who served with Midwives for Haiti. Questions were designed to elicit information about how well the volunteers were prepared for their experience, the effectiveness of translation services, and suggestions for improving the preparation of volunteers and strengthening the education program. ResultsAnalysis of the surveys of volunteers, staff, midwives, and the Haitian students generated several common themes. The 3 groups agreed that the volunteers made an effective contribution to the program of education and that the volunteer midwives need more preparation prior to serving in Haiti. The 3 groups also agreed on the need for better translators and recommended more structure to the education program. DiscussionThe results of this study are significant to international health care organizations that use volunteer health care professionals to provide services. The results support a growing body of knowledge that international health aid organizations may use to strengthen the preparation, support, and effectiveness of volunteer health providers.

Investigations of 4 representative cases are presented here with a definition of the gross and histopathologic defects and an overview of epidemiologic data gathered from affected farms. Calves showed variable disproportionate dwarfism without arthrogryposis. Long bones were shortened and showed axial rotation. Articular surfaces were distorted with misshapen weight-bearing surfaces associated with variable thickness of articular cartilage. Physes were distorted and variable in thickness with occasional foci of complete closure. The major histologic abnormality in the physes was disorderly development of the zones of cartilage hypertrophy, with reduced number and irregular arrangement of hypertrophic chondrocytes; similar less severe changes were present in the zones of cartilage proliferation. Histochemical staining of the cartilage matrix was variable in intensity, and there was evidence of abnormal resorption of cartilage matrix at the level of the primary spongiosa. Osteoid formation and subsequent bone remodelling seemed unaffected, and diaphyseal cortical bone appeared normal at the gross and light microscopic level.

Among the impacts of climate change on pediatric patients are allergic rhinitis and asthma; heat-related illnesses; premature birth; injuries from severe storms and fires; vector-borne diseases; and mental illnesses. Children are disproportionately affected as well by climate -related displacement of populations, drought, water shortages, and famine.

Reliable and accessible heat and weather warning systems are key in alerting individuals to undertake protective measures. There is a notable gap in understanding how women and caregivers in rural East Africa perceive and utilize weather information. We investigated community members' heat and weather warning information-seeking behaviour, identified available sources, assessed their reliability and utility, and examined their influence on behaviour. Settings Our research was conducted in rural Kilifi County in Kenya's coastal region. The area experiences temperatures exceeding 23 degrees C throughout the year, with extended periods of extreme temperatures [> 40 degrees C] and long and severe droughts. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews [IDI] with pregnant and postpartum women [n = 21] and held six focus group discussions [FGDs] involving mothers-in-law and community health volunteers [CHVs]. The data were analysed in NVivo 12 using both inductive and deductive approaches. Results We found significant gaps concerning pregnant and post-partum women, and their caregivers, having timely access to weather forecasts and heat information from health or meteorological authorities. Information on heat and weather warnings is disseminated through various channels, including television, radio, mobile phones, and word of mouth, which are facilitated by community influencers such as CHVs and local chiefs. Indigenous methods of weather forecasting, such as cloud observation, consulting local ""rainmakers"", and studying the behavioural patterns of amphibians, are employed in conjunction with warnings from the Kenyan Meteorological Department (KMD). Barriers to accessing weather information include the cost of television and smartphones and a lack of segmented information in local languages. Conclusions National and county meteorological services need to enhance public participation, communication, and the delivery of heat and weather information to guide community-level response measures and individual behaviour change. They should also collaborate with health professionals to address heat risks for vulnerable groups. Further research is needed to empower indigenous weather predictors with modern weather information and revise national policies to deliver tailored messages to vulnerable populations like pregnant and postpartum women.";"CLIMATE; HEALTH; FORECASTS; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEMS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Nomads often avoid exposure to infectious agents by moving away from epidemics such as measles. Trachoma is highly prevalent due to flies attracted by cattle. The high prevalence of tuberculosis is ascribed to the presence of cattle, crowded sleeping quarters and lack of health care; treatment compliance is generally poor. Guinea worm disease is common due to unsafe water sources. Helminth infections are relatively rare as people leave their waste behind when they move. Malaria is usually epidemic, leading to high mortality. Sexually transmitted diseases spread easily due to lack of treatment. Leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis are encountered; brucellosis occurs but most often goes undetected. Drought forces nomads to concentrate near water sources or even into relief camps, with often disastrous consequences for their health.

I combine a natural experiment-a strong earthquake in Chile-with a panel survey to capture the effect of prenatal exposure on acute stress and children's cognitive ability. I find that stress exposure in early pregnancy has no effect on children's cognition among middle-class families, but it has a strong negative influence among disadvantaged families. I then examine possible pathways accounting for the socioeconomic stratification in the effect of stress, including differential exposure across socioeconomic status, differential sensitivity, and parental responses.

Bushfire smoke exposure is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes including reduced birth weight and an increased risk of prematurity. Some publications have outlined the adverse health effects on young children, particularly in relation to emergency department presentations and hospital admissions for respiratory problems, but there are no studies in children who were exposed to bushfire smoke in utero. Prenatal stress is likely to occur as a result of catastrophic bushfire events, and stress is known to be associated with poor perinatal and respiratory outcomes.

The Deep South is also unique in that it is the most racially diverse part of the United States and it has the powerful social history of chattel slavery. In this paper, we examine the relationship between race and poverty at the macro (rather than individual) level. Using county-level census data we examine the effects of social segregation on well-being. We find that indeed there is an extremely strong and significant relationship between the racial composition of a county and many measures of well-being (poverty, home ownership, educational attainment, infant mortality and so on). Second, our analysis tests for the effects of racial segregation for whites and African Americans separately. The poverty rate for whites varies little based on the racial composition of the county they live in whereas for African Americans, living in integrated or predominately white counties is significantly correlated with lower levels of poverty. Furthermore, the African American- white poverty gap is significantly lower in integrated and predominately white counties and significantly higher in counties that are racially segregated. Thus, our analysis demonstrates that racial segregation has a more negative and profound effect on the lives of African Americans than it does on whites. We conclude with a discussion of the illustration Hurricane Katrina provides of this general pattern and we offer a set of suggestions for addressing this kind of structural poverty.

The answer to this question has important implications for public policy. If shocks reduce investments in children, they may have a long-lasting impact on poverty and its intergenerational transmission. The authors develop a simple framework to analyze the effects of aggregate economic shocks on child schooling and health. They show that the expected effects are theoretically ambiguous because of a tension between income and substitution effects. They then review the recent empirical literature on the subject. In richer countries, like the United States, child health and education outcomes are counter-cyclical: they improve during recessions. In poorer countries, mostly in Africa and low-income Asia, the outcomes are procyclical: infant mortality rises and school enrollment and nutrition fall during recessions. In the middle-income countries of Latin America, the picture is more nuanced: health outcomes are generally procyclical and education outcomes counter-cyclical. Each of these findings is consistent with the simple conceptual framework.

Epigenetic modification, such as DNA methylation, is considered one possible underlying mechanism. The 1998 Quebec ice storm provides a unique opportunity to study an independent prenatal stressor on child outcomes. C-peptide is the best measure of endogenous insulin secretion and is widely used in the clinical management of patients with diabetes. The objectives of this study are to determine 1) the extent to which prenatal exposure to disaster-related stress (maternal objective hardship and maternal cognitive appraisal) influences children's C-peptide secretion, and 2) whether DNA methylation of diabetes-related genes mediates the effects of prenatal stress on C-peptide secretion. Children's (n = 30) C-peptide secretion in response to an oral glucose tolerance test were assessed in blood at 13 1/2 years. DNA methylation levels of selected type 1 and 2 diabetes-related genes were chosen based upon the genes associated with prenatal maternal objective hardship and/or cognitive appraisal levels. Bootstrapping analyses were performed to determine the mediation effect of DNA methylation. We found that children whose mothers experienced higher objective hardship exhibited higher C-peptide secretion. Cognitive appraisal was not directly associated with C-peptide secretion. DNA methylation of diabetes-related genes had a positive mediation effect of objective hardship on C-peptide secretion: higher objective hardship predicted higher C-peptide secretion through DNA methylation. Negative mediation effects of cognitive appraisal were observed: negative cognitive appraisal predicted higher C-peptide secretion through DNA methylation. However, only one gene, LTA, remained a significant mediator of cognitive appraisal on C-peptide secretion after the conservative Bonferroni multiple corrections.

Although many studies have investigated the reproductive ecology of gartersnakes, we know little about reproduction in the threatened Giant Gartersnake, Thamnophis gigas. We used X-radiography to determine reproductive status and estimated fecundity for 73 female T. gigas collected from several regions within the range of this species in the Sacramento Valley of California, USA, and synthesize these data with data from litters born in captivity to improve our understanding of reproduction in this species. Average total litter size determined from X-rays (15.9) and captive-born litters (15.5) are within the ranges reported from other gartersnakes, but captive-born litters had high rates of stillbirth. Only 154 of 202 neonates from captive snakes were born alive, and seven of 13 litters contained at least one stillborn neonate. We found that fecundity was positively related to maternal snout-vent length, and some evidence that larger litters contained smaller neonates. The proportion of X-rayed females that were gravid was 0.50 in 2014, 0.47 in and 2015, and 0.64 in 2016.

Even though prosimians are known to be long-lived in captivity, relatively little is known about their reproductive senescence, and even less is known about how prosimians age in their natural habitats. Twenty years of observational data in Madagascar for four Propithecus edwordsi sifaka groups were used to analyze reproductive and behavioral trends of aging in the wild. Techniques using tooth wear were developed to establish ages of wild sifakas and to estimate the onset of their 'dental senescence', a proxy for the onset of decline in the ability to obtain nutrition. Estimated maximum longevity was 32 years for female sifakas. Based on the loss of dental functional morphology, and changes in tooth wear patterns and in chewing efficiency, dental senescence was estimated to set in at approximately 18 years of age. Of the adult females in the study groups, the yearly average of the number of dentally senescent females was 24%. There was no indication of a decline in fertility in the dentally senescent females (aged > 18 years) compared to younger adult females (aged 4-18 years). The field data showed, however, that in years when rain was decreased during months of prime lactation, infants of dentally senescent mothers died before weaning. This may be because the nursing mother's worn teeth could not shear leaves and extract moisture, nor nutrition, both essential for successful lactation. Old females showed no clear signs of social disengagement, further suggesting that drought-induced stress plays a direct role in increased infant mortality. These data support earlier findings that prosimian females continue to cycle and give birth until death. The effect of environmental variation on infant survival, however, indicates an incipient age-linked decline in reproductive fitness. Therefore, whereas lemurs represent the condition of no menopause, changes in infant survival may uncover selective factors that have in part led to the evolution of menopause in other primates.

The main influences on maternal health encompass social, economic, political, environmental and cultural determinants of health. To effectively address maternal mortality in the post-2015 agenda, interventions need to consider the determinants of health so that their delivery is not limited to the health sector. The objective of this exploratory qualitative study was to identify key community groups' perspectives on the perceived determinants of maternal health in rural areas of southern Mozambique. Methods: Eleven focus group discussions were conducted with women of reproductive age, pregnant women, matrons, male partners, community leaders and health workers. Participants were recruited using sampling techniques of convenience and snow balling. Focus groups had an average of nine participants each. The heads of 12 administrative posts were also interviewed to understand the local context. Data were coded and analysed thematically using NVivo software. Results: A broad range of political, economic, socio-cultural and environmental determinants of maternal health were identified by community representatives. It was perceived that the civil war has resulted in local unemployment and poverty that had a number of downstream effects including lack of funds for accessing medical care and transport, and influence on socio-cultural determinants, particularly gender relations that disadvantaged women. Socio-cultural determinants included intimate partner violence toward women, and strained relationships with in-laws and co-spouses. Social relationships were complex as there were both negative and positive impacts on maternal health. Environmental determinants included natural disasters and poor access to roads and transport exacerbated by the wet season and subsequent flooding. Conclusions: In rural southern Mozambique, community perceptions of the determinants of maternal health included political, economic, socio-cultural and environmental factors. These determinants were closely linked with one another and highlight the importance of including the local history, context, culture and geography in the design of maternal health programs.";"Maternal health; Pregnancy; Determinants of health; Disparities; Poverty; Equity; PREGNANT-WOMEN; EXPOSURE; CARE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Explanations of the association include reduced conception of males and increased fetal deaths among males. The latter explanation has been supported by research reporting that the sex ratio in California fell 3 months, but not 8, 9 or 10 months, after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. California's distance from the attacks raises the questions of whether the results arose from chance and would be found elsewhere. We contribute to the literature by testing the association between the secondary sex ratio and the events of September 11 in New York City. METHODS: We replicate the California tests by applying interrupted time-series methods, which control for secular trends, seasonality and other forms of autocorrelation, to 91 cohorts born in New York City during 28-day periods from January 1996 to June 2002. RESULTS: As hypothesized, the sex ratio in New York City in the period 1 January to 28 January 2002 fell to 1, which was the lowest observed value during the test period and significantly (i.e. P < 0.01, two-tailed test) below the value expected from history.

With leptospirosis being an emerging infectious disease and as the world's environment changes with more floods and environmental disasters, the burden of leptospirosis is expected to increase. The objectives of the systematic review were to explore how leptospirosis affects pregnancy, its burden in this population, its effects on maternal and fetal outcomes and the evidence base surrounding treatment options Methods We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished literature using automated and manual methods to screen nine electronic databases since inception, with no language restriction. Two reviewers independently screened articles, completed the data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. Due to significant heterogeneity and paucity of data, we were unable to carry out a meta-analysis, but we conducted a pooled analysis of individual patient data from the case reports and case series to examine the patient and disease characteristics, diagnostic methods, differential diagnoses, antibiotic treatments, and outcomes of leptospirosis in pregnancy. The protocol for this review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO: CRD42020151501. Results We identified 419 records, of which we included eight observational studies, 21 case reports, three case series and identified four relevant ongoing studies. Overall the studies were with moderate bias and of 'fair' quality. We estimated the incidence of leptospirosis in pregnancy to be 1.3 per 10,000 in women presenting with fever or with jaundice, but this is likely to be higher in endemic areas. Adverse fetal outcomes were found to be more common in pregnant patients who presented in the second trimester compared with patients who presented in the third trimester. There is overlap between how leptospirosis presents in pregnancy and in the general population. There is also overlap between the signs, symptoms and biochemical disturbances associated with leptospirosis in pregnancy and the presentation of pregnancy associated conditions, such as Pre-Eclampsia (PET), Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) and HELLP Syndrome (Haemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platelets). In 94% of identified cases with available data, there was an indicator in the patient history regarding exposure that could have helped include leptospirosis in the clinician's differential diagnosis. We also identified a range of suitable antibiotic therapies for treating leptospirosis in pregnancy, most commonly used were penicillins Conclusion This is the first systematic review of leptospirosis in pregnancy and it clearly shows the need to improve early diagnosis and treatment by asking early, treating early, and reporting well. Ask early-broaden differential diagnoses and ask early for potential leptospirosis exposures and risk factors.

Despite of all these limitations, under the banner of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) a special focus and progress in addressing maternal health issue (set as goal 5) has been made over the last decade. In this review, improvement and short falls pertaining to Goal 5 Improve maternal health have been analyzed in relation to earlier years. A decline in maternal mortality ratio (MMR) (490 maternal deaths in 1990 to 260 maternal deaths per 100,000 women in 2010) is observed. Reduction in MMR by three quarters was not achieved but a decline from very high mortality to high mortality index was observed. Increase usage of contraceptives (with contraceptive prevalence rate of 11.8 in 1990 to 37 in 2013) also shed light on women awareness about their health and social issues. Based on progress level assessment (WHO guidelines),access of Pakistani women to universal reproductive health unit falls in moderate category in 2010 as compared to earlier low access in 1990. From the data it looks that still a lot of effort is required for achieving the said targets. However, keeping in view all challenges, Pakistan suffered in the said duration, like volatile peace, regional political instability, policy implementation constrains, population growth, this slow but progressive trend highlight a national resilience to address the havoc challenge of maternal health.These understandings and sustained efforts will significantly contribute a best possible accomplishment in Millennium Development Goal 5 by 2015.";"Maternal health; Indicators; Improvements; World Health Organization";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Therefore, a more resilient community can be built after disasters by reducing the damages of disasters at national and international level. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the disaster resilience of countries. In this study, by analyzing the data of 181 countries in 2018 and 2019, the rate of total population affected by disasters was employed as dependent variable and the factors indicating the development level of countries as independent variables. The data were analyzed with the help of ArcGIS 10.7 program using ordinary least squares regression analysis that reveals general relationships and geographical weighted regres-sion analysis that shows local relationships across study area. In conclusion, in the general model, compulsory education duration in 2018 was the only variable that positively and significantly predicted the rate of total population affected by disasters. While neonatal mortality rate and unemployment predicted positively and significantly the rate of total population affected by di-sasters in 2019, urban population rate predicted negatively and significantly. The effect of all the independent variables on the rate of total population affected by disasters differed depending on time and region. The result of this study is expected to contribute to the national and international organizations responsible for disaster risk reduction efforts to prepare more effective and efficient disaster plans. In addition, the method and approach of this study may give an idea to scientists investigating on disasters.";"Disaster; Resilience; Ordinary least squares regression analysis; Geographical weighted regression analysis; NATURAL DISASTERS; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; MORTALITY; PREPAREDNESS; IMPACTS; RISK; EARTHQUAKE";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Blood banks (33 % availability) and oxygen concentrators (58 %) were notable infrastructural deficits. For human resources, 69 % and 33 % of hospitals employed at least one full-time surgeon and anaesthesiologist, respectively. Ninety-eight percent of hospitals reported capacity to perform resuscitation. General and obstetrical surgical interventions were relatively more available, for example 93 % provided hernia repairs and 98 % provided cesarean sections. More specialized interventions were at a deficit: cataract surgery (27 %), cleft repairs (31 %), clubfoot (42 %), and open treatment of fractures (51 %). Deficiencies in infrastructure and material resources were widespread and should be urgently addressed. Physician providers were mal-distributed relative to non-physician providers. Formal task-sharing to midlevel and general physician providers should be considered.

We review the effects of halogen exposure on the parturient with a focus on bromine toxicity. Bromine is the most extensively studied agent in the context of pregnancy and to-date murine models form the basis for the majority of current knowledge. Pregnancy potentiates the acute lung injury after halogen exposure. In addition, halogen exposure precipitates a preeclamptic-like syndrome in mice. This phenotype is characterized by systemic and pulmonary hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, decreased cardiac output, placental injury and fetal growth restriction. This constellation contributes to increased maternal and fetal mortality observed after bromine exposure. Angiogenic imbalance is noted with overexpression of the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) form of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 reminiscent of human preeclampsia.

Dry does gained more live weight, grew 26 % more mohair which was 1.7 mu m coarser compared with does with single litter. The results indicate that feeding lucerne hay even under adverse seasonal conditions was of little value. The lactation performance of these grazing Angora does was substantially less than their potential. Optimum barley feeding was GL 345 g/d/doe. There was evidence of substitution of pasture for hay.

To improve maternal health coverage, an Android-based, integrated mobile health (mHealth) app called YendaNafe was introduced to community health workers (CHWs) in the Neno district, rural Malawi. This study evaluates the impact of this app on the uptake of antenatal care (ANC), facility-based births, and postnatal care (PNC), compared to a reference period where CHWs provided the same services without mHealth, using the interrupted time series analysis. Patients and Methods: Using aggregated monthly data and segmented quasi-Poisson regression models, we compared the effects of mHealth on selected maternal health outcomes. The models were adjusted for the COVID-19 pandemic, the occurrence of cyclones, and a cholera epidemic. We analyzed data from six eligible health facilities and their respective catchment areas in which CHWs were using YendaNafe, and compared 12 months before and 12 months after its introduction. Results: The use of YendaNafe was associated with a 22% immediate increase in facility-based births (aIRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12-1.33, p<0.001) but not an immediate increase in new ANC visits (aIRR 1.02,95% CI 0.90-1.14, p=0.77), ANC in the first trimester (aIRR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95-1.45 p=0.13), or PNC visits (aIRR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79-1.36, p=0.81).

Children and young teenagers constitute some 50% of war-stricken populations. This paper explores this increasingly important role of military medicine from the point of view of a practicing pediatrician and career doctor-soldier. Many international operational deployments undertaken in the last 5 years have required the insertion of pediatric clinical and preventive health resources. Deployments to Rwanda, the countries of the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Bougainville (in Papua New Guinea), Irian Jaya (in Indonesia), and the Aitape tsunami disaster response (the Sepik region of Papua New Guinea) have all necessitated major pediatric interventions. In some operational deployments, in excess of one-third of patient and clinical contacts have involved the care of children, including clinical treatments ranging from life-saving resuscitation to the care of children with both tropical and subtropical illnesses. They have also involved mass immunization campaigns (e.g., in Rwanda) to prevent measles and meningococcal septicemia. In developing countries, at any time approximately 1 in 4 teenage and adult women is pregnant; and of these, 1 in 15 is suffering a miscarriage during any 2-week period. The implications of this audit are that service members must be multiskilled not only in the traditional aspects of military medicine and nursing but also in (a) the developmental aspects of childhood; (b) the prevention of infectious childhood diseases by immunization and other means; (c) the recognition and management of diseases of childhood; and (d) the management of the normal neonate and infant, especially those orphaned in refugee, disaster, and other emergency situations. Doctor-soldiers hold special credentials to be advocates for the protection of children caught up in armed conflict and its aftermath. In this context, advocacy to ban antipersonnel land mines is topical, because unfortunately the more than 2,000 deaths and injuries each month involve children and their families, often injured long after the cessation of hostilities.

There has been controversy about the effectiveness and safety of this approach, but no pharmacovigilance studies or evaluations have been published to date. Method: A questionnaire about the cultivation of A. annua, treatment of patients, and side-effects observed, was sent to partners of the NGO Anamed in Kenya and Uganda. Some of the respondents were then selected purposively for more in-depth semi-structured interviews. Results: Eighteen partners in Kenya and 21 in Uganda responded. 49% reported difficulties in growing the plant, mainly due to drought. Overall about 3,000 cases of presumed malaria had been treated with A. annua teas in the previous year, of which about 250 were in children and 54 were in women in the first trimester of pregnancy. The commonest problem observed in children was poor compliance due to the bitter taste, which was improved by the addition of sugar or honey. Two miscarriages were reported in pregnant patients. Only four respondents reported side-effects in other patients, the commonest of which was vomiting. 51% of respondents had started using A. annua tea to treat illnesses other than malaria. Conclusions: Local cultivation and preparation of A. annua are feasible where growing conditions are appropriate. Few adverse events were reported even in children and pregnant women. Where ACT is in short supply, it would make sense to save it for young children, while using A. annua infusions to treat older patients who are at lower risk. An ongoing pharmacovigilance system is needed to facilitate reporting of any adverse events.";"ANTIMALARIAL ACTIVITY; FALCIPARUM-MALARIA; HERBAL TEA; L.";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Climate-related events and natural disasters are severely impacting sexual and reproductive rights as well as the ability of individuals to become parents and care for their children. Through a systematic review conducted using the PRISMA method, this article addresses the impact of the climate crisis on the three core principles of reproductive justice: (1) the right not to have a child; (2) the right to have a child; and (3) the right to parent children in safe and healthy environments. While the review found no empirical studies addressing how the climate crisis impacts the right not to have children, the findings suggest that hurricanes, floods, heatwaves, droughts, and coastal erosion are associated with greater intentions of remaining childless and having fewer children, increasing fetal mortality and preterm births, decreasing new-born sex ratios and birth weight, rising birth risks, declining birth rates, and increasing challenges to parenting and childcare. We argue that the climate crisis fundamentally undermines reproductive justice by preventing individuals from fully and equitably exercising their reproductive rights to have children and to parent in safe and sustainable environments. In doing so, we stress that the climate crisis should be considered when addressing the challenges of reproductive justice and that addressing these challenges requires implementing policies that not only seek to mitigate the effects of climate disruptions but also strengthen the capacity of individuals and communities to adapt to changing environmental conditions, ensuring more sustainable reproductive futures.

Occasionally the cellular O-2 requirement becomes critical and an O-2 deficit in blood (hypoxemia) may evolve to a tissue deficit (hypoxia) and finally a risk of organ damage (asphyxia). An increase in Hthorn concentration is reflected in a decrease in pH, which together with increased base deficit is a proxy for the level of fetal O-2 deficit. Base deficit (or its negative value, base excess) was introduced to reflect the metabolic component of a low pH and to distinguish from the respiratory cause of a low pH, which is a high CO2 concentration. Base deficit is a theoretical estimate and not a measured parameter, calculated by the blood gas analyzer from values of pH, the partial pressure of CO2, and hemoglobin. Different brands of analyzers use different calculation equations, and base deficit values can thus differ by multiples. This could influence the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis, which is commonly defined as a pH <7.00 combined with a base deficit >= 12.0 mmol/L in umbilical cord arterial blood. Base deficit can be calculated as base deficit in blood (or actual base deficit) or base deficit in extracellular fluid (or standard base deficit). The extracellular fluid compartment represents the blood volume diluted with the interstitial fluid. Base deficit in extracellular fluid is advocated for fetal blood because a high partial pressure of CO2 (hypercapnia) is common in newborns without concomitant hypoxia, and hypercapnia has a strong influence on the pH value, then termed respiratory acidosis. An increase in partial pressure of CO2 causes less increase in base deficit in extracellular fluid than in base deficit in blood, thus base deficit in extracellular fluid better represents the metabolic component of acidosis. The different types of base deficit for defining metabolic acidosis in cord blood have unfortunately not been noticed by many obstetrical experts and organizations. In addition to an increase in Hthorn concentration, the lactate production is accelerated during hypoxia and anaerobic metabolism. There is no global consensus on definitions of normal cord blood gases and lactate, and different cutoff values for abnormality are used. At a pH <7.20, 7% to 9% of newborns are deemed academic; at <7.10, 1% to 3%; and at <7.00, 0.26% to 1.3%. From numerous studies of different eras and sizes, it can firmly be concluded that in the cord artery, the statistically defined lower pH limit (mean -2 standard deviations) is 7.10. Given that the pH for optimal enzyme activity differs between different cell types and organs, it seems difficult to establish a general biologically critical pH limit. The blood gases and lactate in cord blood change with the progression of pregnancy toward a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidemia because of increased metabolism and CO2 production in the growing fetus. Gestational age-adjusted normal reference values have accordingly been published for pH and lactate, and they associate with Apgar score slightly better than stationary cutoffs, but they are not widely used in clinical practice. On the basis of good-quality data, it is reasonable to set a cord artery lactate cutoff (mean thorn2 standard deviations) at 10 mmol/L at 39 to 40 weeks' gestation. For base deficit, it is not possible to establish statistically defined reference values because base deficit is calculated with different equations, and there is no consensus on which to use. Arterial cord blood represents the fetus better than venous blood, and samples from both vessels are needed to validate the arterial origin. A venoarterial pH gradient of<0.02 is commonly used to differentiate arterial from venous samples. Reference values for pH in cord venous blood have been determined, but venous blood comes from the placenta after clearance of a surplus of arterial CO2, and base deficit in venous blood then overestimates the metabolic component of fetal acidosis. The ambition to increase neonatal hemoglobin and iron depots by delaying cord clamping after birth results in falsely acidic blood gas and lactate values if the blood sampling is also delayed. Within seconds after birth, sour metabolites accumulated in peripheral tissues and organs will flood into the central circulation and further to the cord arteries when the newborn starts to breathe, move, and cry. This influence of ""hidden acidosis"" can be avoided by needle puncture of unclamped cord vessels and blood collection immediately after birth. Because of a continuing anaerobic glycolysis in the collected blood, it should be analyzed within 5 minutes to not result in a falsely high lactate value. If the syringe is placed in ice slurry, the time limit is 20 minutes. For pH, it is reasonable to wait no longer than 15 minutes if not in ice. Routine analyses of cord blood gases enable perinatal audits to gain the wisdom of hindsight, to maintain quality assurance at a maternity unit over years by following the rate of neonatal acidosis, to compare results between hospitals on regional or national bases, and to obtain an objective outcome measure in clinical research. Given that the intrapartum cardiotocogram is an uncertain proxy for fetal hypoxia, and there is no strong correlation between pathologic cardiotocograms and fetal acidosis, a cord artery pH may help rather than hurt a staff person subjected to a malpractice suit based on undesirable cardiotocogram patterns. Contrary to common beliefs and assumptions, up to 90% of cases of cerebral palsy do not originate from intrapartum events. Future research will elucidate whether cell injury markers with point-of-care analysis will become valuable in improving the dating of perinatal injuries and differentiating hypoxic from nonhypoxic injuries.";"acidemia; acidosis; Apgar; asphyxia; base deficit; base excess; birth; cerebral palsy; cord blood analysis; cord blood gases; encephalopathy; hypoxia; lactate; metabolic acidosis; neonatal outcome; perinatal outcome; pH; pregnancy; HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; ACID-BASE STATUS; FOR-GESTATIONAL-AGE; VELOCITY WAVE-FORMS; METABOLIC-ACIDOSIS; ARTERIAL-BLOOD; APGAR SCORE; NEONATAL COMPLICATIONS; PREDICTIVE VALUE; NEWBORN-INFANTS";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Using the rich source of ethnographic data on child-death and mortuary practices among Southeast Bantu speakers, we explore the cultural significance and symbolic meaning of an infant pot burial uncovered on Melora Saddle, an early nineteenth-century African farmer settlement on the Waterberg Plateau, Limpopo Province. The skeletal remains belong to a perinatal individual, aged between 34 weeks gestation and newborn. The short-necked jar was interred in an upright position either inside, or close to, a house. Ethnographic data show that a conceptual link was made between a woman's reproductive capacity and the land's fertility, as well as between potting and procreation. A close symbolic link existed between pots, wombs, mothers and their houses. Child-birth and child-death were fraught with ritual danger that had to be averted to ensure the well-being of the family and the community. Any deviations from the natural order of things generated pollution (heat or dirt), which threatened a woman's fertility and a lineage's continuation. Such ritual impurity not only destabilised the social order, but also disturbed the natural order, as a result of which the rains, the ultimate sign of a community's well-being, might stay away. To counter the ritual danger, and thereby to restore a woman's fertility and avoid a drought, foetuses and infants were buried in jars, either in a cool, wet place in the bank of a river, or inside a house or in the shade under its eaves. As in the case of the Melora Saddle jar, the bases of such burial vessels were often deliberately perforated, evidently a symbolic act to ensure that a woman would become pregnant again. Ash, representing an extinguished fire, served as an important cooling agent in such burials, which would account for the location of several midden burials uncovered in Iron Age sites.";"fertility; foetus; miscarriage; neonate; perinatal; pollution; pot burial; ritual impurity; symbolisation; uterus; Iron Age; Waterberg";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

At the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000, 189 member States adopted a declaration that synthesized the priorities of the international agenda and reflected the commitments that had been painstakingly negotiated. The Millennium Declaration and the eight goals it identified have become a road map for tackling poverty, instability, HIV/AIDS, gender inequality, and violence in virtually all parts of the world. The International Potato Center (CIP)'s vision is to contribute to the fulfillment of the Millennium Development Goals, in particular those that relate to reducing poverty, hunger, child and maternal mortality, and sustainable development in rural and urban systems. New research with this valuable genetic resource targeting micronutrient levels, production, stress tolerance, and value adding for new markets is invigorating farming communities in the Andean center of origin and diversity of potato. Fe content (on a dry weight basis) is comparable to levels found in some cereals (rice, maize and wheat), but with better bio-availability due to lower phytate and higher ascorbic acid contents. A food intake study was carried out in six locations in Huancavelica to gain understanding of the role of the potato in the Andean diet, with an emphasis on women and children as the most vulnerable to malnutrition. Resulting information is being used to identify varieties with higher levels of Fe and Zn to improve micronutrient intake and simultaneously to assess the potential for enhancing Fe and Zn concentration through breeding and selection. An impressive range of 17-33% dry matter was found in a large number of native varieties, significantly higher than a control group of improved varieties, which contained 22-27% (Amoros et al., 2006). The outstanding organoleptic properties of many of the diploid and tetraploid native potatoes, as well as the relatively high contents identified for Fe and Zn (Burgos et al., 2007) and the antioxidant properties of those with high contents of anthocyanins (Culley et al., 2003.) are aimed at strengthening traditional Andean farming systems and benefiting potato farmers and consumers across the globe.";"Solanum tuberosum; andean culture; genetic diversity; drought tolerance; nutrition; breeding for increased micronutrients; improving livelihoods";"";"";"";"";"English";"CPAPER";""

The Horn of Africa, which includes eastern Ethiopia, northeast Kenya, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Somalia, has natural characteristics that favor high groundwater salinity. Excess salinity has been linked to infrastructure and health problems, including increased infant mortality. This region has suffered successive droughts that have limited the availability of safe drinking water resources, leading to a humanitarian crisis for which little spatially explicit information about groundwater salinity is available. Methods: Machine learning (random forest) is used to make spatial predictions of salinity levels at three electrical conductivity (EC) thresholds using data from 8646 boreholes and wells along with environmental predictor variables. Attention is paid to understanding the input data, balancing classes, performing many iterations, specifying cut-off values, employing spatial cross-validation, and identifying spatial uncertainties. Results: Estimates are made for this transboundary region of the population potentially exposed to hazardous salinity levels. The findings indicate that about 11.6 million people (similar to 7% of the total population), including 400,000 infants and half a million pregnant women, rely on groundwater for drinking and live in areas of high groundwater salinity (EC > 1500 mu S/cm). Somalia is the most affected and has the largest number of people potentially exposed. Around 50% of the Somali population (5 million people) may be exposed to unsafe salinity levels in their drinking water. In only five of Somalia's 18 regions are less than 50% of infants potentially exposed to unsafe salinity levels. The main drivers of high salinity include precipitation, groundwater recharge, evapo-ration, ocean proximity, and fractured rocks. The combined overall accuracy and area under the curve of multiple runs is similar to 82%. Conclusions: The modelled groundwater salinity maps for three different salinity thresholds in the Horn of Africa highlight the uneven spatial distribution of salinity in the studied countries and the large area affected, which is mainly arid flat lowlands. The results of this study provide the first detailed mapping of groundwater salinity in the region, providing essential information for water and health scientists along with decision-makers to identify and prioritize areas and populations in need of assistance.";"Drinking water; Groundwater quality; Water scarcity; Human health; Djibouti; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Kenya; Somalia; Spatial modeling; Machine learning; Random forest; DRINKING-WATER SALINITY; DYNAMICS; SODIUM; SYSTEM; HEALTH; TOOL";"";"";"";"";"English";"JOUR";""

Wildfire activity is intensifying in Latin America due to climate and land-use changes, but the health impacts of wildfire-derived PM2.5 in urban areas remain poorly quantified and recognized. Objective. To assess the evidence on wildfire-related PM2.5 and its association with mortality and morbidity in Latin American cities.  Materials and methods. We conducted a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines, using data from PubMed, Scopus, and Bireme. One reviewer independently screened 163 articles and extracted data from 14 eligible studies. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results. Most studies were conducted in Brazil (n = 12) and used time-series or modelling designs to estimate health risks. Wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure was associated with all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Reported effect estimates ranged from 1.7 to 7.7% increases in risk per 10 µg/m³ of exposure. Other studies assessed preterm birth, COVID-19 outcomes, and site-specific cancers. While two studies provided harmonized RR estimates for all-cause mortality, high heterogeneity and methodological differences prevented formal meta-analysis. Conclusion. Wildfire smoke contributes measurably to premature mortality in Latin America, but current evidence is unevenly distributed across regions, time periods, and population subgroups. Studies rarely capture the disproportionate risks faced by indigenous and rural communities or the intraurban disparities linked to poverty and geography.

METHODS  Case-control study, carried out with live births at the Municipal Hospital of Governador Valadares, from May 2017 to July 2018. The case group consisted of full-term live births and low birthweight, and the control group consisted of full-term live births with adequate weight, matched by gender and date of birth. For each case, two controls were selected. Data collection was performed through interviews with the puerperal women, and complementary information was obtained by analyzing the prenatal card and medical records. For data analysis, logistic regression was performed.  RESULTS  The study included 65 live births from the case group and 130 from the control group. After the analysis was adjusted for other factors under study, we found that the higher risks of low birthweight are associated with the first childbirth (OR = 2.033; 95%CI = 1.047-3.948; p = 0.036), smoking during pregnancy (OR = 2.850; 95%CI = 1.013-8.021; p = 0.047) and consumption of water supplied by the municipalities affected by the tailings from the Fundão dam failure (RC = 2.444; 95%CI = 1.203-4.965; p = 0.013).

Environmental risk factors, including air pollution, are increasingly identified as contributors to the risk profile of CHD. We sought to investigate the temporal association between frequency and severity of fetal CHD with air quality in the D.C. metropolitan region. Methods: We queried all fetal diagnoses of CHD at a tertiary care center over a 5-year period, inclusive of a wildfire smoke event. We categorized each case as critical or non-critical CHD and assigned the case to the estimated month of delivery. We used descriptive statistics to show temporal trends in fetal CHD and the relationship with publicly available air quality data. Results: Of the 685 CHD cases, approximately 60% were considered critical CHD. The highest number of cases occurred in March 2024 (coincident with a periconception period in June 2023 during peak wildfire smoke exposure). An additional peak in CHD cases in February 2023 also coincided with a worse air quality peak during the cardiac embryonic period. However, there was no change in the percentage of critical CHD during these peaks.

Here, we examined the association between prenatal wildfire-specific particulate matter ≤2.5µm (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) exposure and pregnancy loss in Colorado, USA. Methods: We retrieved all birth records from the 17 ‘Front Range’ counties (just east of the Rocky Mountains) of Colorado from 2007 to 2018 (n=614 321). We considered two PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposures—wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> from a novel machine learning model and non-wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> constructed using the Community Multiscale Air Quality model. We fitted quasi-Poisson distributed lag models to estimate the associations between the two weekly-resolved PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposures during pregnancy and live birth-identified conceptions (LBICs) in each county. That is, we used the predicted change in the LBICs to directly infer the change in the number of pregnancy losses due to the exposure. Results: Average weekly non-wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> was 6.2µg/m3 (SD 2.3). In weeks with non-zero WFS (27% of all county-weeks), the average wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> was 0.92µg/m3 (SD: 1.55). Wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> appeared important in gestational weeks 6–13—a 1-µg/m3 higher exposure sustained in these gestational weeks was associated with 20 [95% confidence interval (CI): 4–34] losses/year. In contrast, the cumulative association with non-wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> was stronger—a 1-µg/m3 higher exposure sustained in every week of pregnancy was associated with 84 (95% CI: 46–129) losses/year. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that both wildfire-specific and non-wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposures were associated with more pregnancy loss and add to the growing literature on the harmful effects of wildfires and, more broadly, air pollution. © The Author(s) 2026.

Method A cross-sectional study was designed. The sample consisted of 272 pregnant earthquake survivors who were admitted to a hospital in southern Türkiye. Data were collected using The Personal Information Disclosure Form, The Impact of Event Scale (IES), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression. Results The mean IES total score was 41.37±19.73. The mean scores for the IES subscales were: Intrusion 15.17±8.19, Avoidance 15.25±6.74, and Hyperarousal 10.95±6.40. Considering the diagnostic cut-off value of 33 for PTSD on the IES, the mean IES score among the pregnant women in this study (41.37±19.73) indicates that their PTSD levels were above average and they were found to be at risk for PTSD. In general, positive, significant, but weak correlations were observed between the scale scores. A non-significant, positive, and very weak correlation was found between the IES and PSQI total scores (p>0.05). Conclusion Pregnant earthquake survivors exhibited elevated PTSD levels and poor sleep quality. Although the association between PTSD and sleep quality was weak, the findings highlight the need for psychological screening and supportive interventions in antenatal care following disasters. © 2026 Georg Thieme Verlag.

This study assessed associations between wildfire fine particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and adverse birth weight outcomes among singleton term births in California for 2007–2018. Exposure was assessed using bias-corrected Community Multiscale Air Quality Model, linked to residence at delivery. Logistic and linear regression models estimated associations between average daily wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> and birth weight outcomes, adjusting for individual-level sociodemographic covariates and seasonality. We conducted race/ethnicity-stratified analyses to assess whether the influence of wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> differed among racially marginalized populations. In a sample of 4,537,418 term births, a 1 μg/m3 increase in wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of large for gestational age and an increase in birth weight, as well as moderately decreased odds of low birth weight and small for gestational age. These associations were more pronounced among Hispanic individuals and those in the Other race category. Conversely, among American Indian and Alaska Native births, exposure to wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> was associated with decreased odds of large for gestational age.

We collected data on child health indicators (LBW and malnutrition) and social determinants, including orphan status, child food poverty, proximity to clinics, water access, and sanitation access, from the Children's Institute at the University of Cape Town. Environmental data, comprising the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and maximum temperatures, were retrieved from MODIS, Global SPEI, and TerraClimate datasets, covering 2002 to 2022. We then fitted a series of linear regressions and combined them into a structural equation model to explore relationships between socio-environmental factors and child health outcomes. Results indicate that the Northern Cape, Western Cape, and Free State are highly vulnerable to agricultural drought, with NDVI showing a strong negative association with LBW and malnutrition. Orphan status emerged as a stronger predictor of malnutrition than drought. The impact of orphan status on malnutrition level is mediated by limited access to basic services such as water and sanitation. Proximity to clinics significantly influenced access to basic services, highlighting a double burden of healthcare and environmental deprivations. These findings expose the need for targeted interventions to enhance food security, water, and sanitation access, particularly for orphaned children, and to integrate drought mitigation into child health policies in South Africa. © 2026.

In this article, we introduce a novel strategy for estimating the effects of geographically bounded disasters when localized outcome data are unavailable. We employ this strategy to estimate the effect of exposure to severe tornadoes on infant birth weight in the United States from 1991 to 2017. We merge county-month data on singleton births with block-group-level monthly data on the paths of severe tornadoes and block-group data on the distribution of the population at risk of a birth. We then estimate difference-in-differences models in which the treatment variable is equal to the percentage of the population at risk of a birth affected by the tornado. This strategy results in an estimand that is both more interpretable and more policy-relevant than estimands from traditional models.

We investigated this association in the prospective nationwide US Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Cohort, focusing on prenatal wildfire PM2·5 exposure intensity, duration, and timing. METHODS: In this cohort analysis, we included live singleton births recorded in the ECHO Cohort with available data on gestational age at birth and birthweight and dates of conception between Jan 1, 2006, and March 20, 2020. Census tract-level estimates of daily mean wildfire-derived PM2·5 for the years 2006-20 from a previous machine learning model were linked to residential address history. We calculated the mean concentration of daily wildfire PM2·5, days with wildfire PM2·5 (>0, ≥2·5, ≥5·0, and ≥10·0 μg/m3; termed smoke days) and consecutive smoke days (2, 3, or ≥4 days; termed smoke waves) above the prespecified concentration thresholds across pregnancy. Associations of cumlative pregnancy wildfire PM2·5 exposure with preterm birth (delivery before 37 weeks of gestation) were analysed by adjusted pooled logistic regression in the nationwide ECHO sample and in the US West census region. Associations between smoke days in gestational weeks 0-35 and preterm birth were evaluated by logistic regression in the national sample. FINDINGS: We included 20 034 births from 30 ECHO Cohort study sites, with residences during pregnancy in all 48 contiguous US states and the District of Columbia. 1687 (8·4%) of the 20 034 infants were preterm. The mean daily wildfire PM2·5 concentration during pregnancy was 0·36 μg/m3 (SD 0·46), with exposure to a mean of 22·2 smoke days (SD 16·6) of any wildfire PM2·5 concentration (>0 μg/m3). Estimates of association between wildfire PM2·5 exposure metrics and preterm birth included the null in nationwide analyses; whereas, in the US West sample (N=5807), we estimated increased odds of preterm birth associated with mean daily wildfire PM2·5 (odds ratio [OR] 1·139 per 1-μg/m3 increase [95% CI 1·001-1·296]), exposure to smoke days with a wildfire PM2·5 concentration of 5·0 μg/m3 or greater (OR 1·018 per additional smoke day [1·003-1·032]) and 10·0 μg/m3 or greater (OR 1·030 [1·006-1·054]), and exposure to ≥4-day smoke waves of 5·0 μg/m3 or greater (OR 1·185 per additional smoke wave [1·044-1·347]) and 10·0 μg/m3 or greater (OR 1·232 [1·029-1·475]). At the national level, by week of gestation, associations with preterm birth were observed in mid-pregnancy for smoke days with wildfire PM2·5 concentrations above 0 μg/m3, of 2·5 μg/m3 or greater, and of 5·0 μg/m3 or greater, and in late pregnancy for smoke days of 10·0 μg/m3 or greater. INTERPRETATION: In a prospective cohort, we observed increased odds of preterm birth associated with wildfire PM2·5 exposure in the western USA, with findings suggesting an exposure-response relationship for increasing exposure intensity and duration. Preterm birth was also associated with exposure to smoke days in mid-to-late pregnancy at the national level. For practice and policy, these findings support the need for public health interventions aimed at reducing exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy.

Puerto Rico—a U.S. territory with a colonial history—offers a unique case for examining how multiple disasters, including Hurricane Maria, ongoing earthquakes, and the COVID-19 pandemic, interact with structural vulnerabilities to affect maternal and child health. Despite increasing attention to climate-related health outcomes, little is known about the reproductive health impacts of cumulative disaster exposure in colonial contexts. Methods: We used U.S. National Vital Statistics System data (2017–2021) to assess associations between disaster exposure and six maternal and newborn outcomes: preterm birth, low birthweight, term low birthweight, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, and excessive weight gain. Disaster exposure was defined based on the timing of hurricanes and the pandemic, using a three-month lag period. We analyzed data from Puerto Rico and used Florida and Texas as comparison sites. Multivariable log-binomial regression models estimated adjusted prevalence ratios. Effect modification was tested for (1) region within Puerto Rico and (2) colonial status, comparing Puerto Rico (territory) to Florida and Texas (states). Simulations were conducted to account for potential live-birth bias. Results: Across 104,560 births in Puerto Rico, disaster periods were consistently associated with worse maternal health outcomes. For example, during the late post-hurricane period, gestational diabetes increased (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31), while term low birthweight surprisingly appeared to decline (RR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.98). Associations with newborn health were mixed and may have been underestimated due to sharp declines in live births after disasters. Simulations suggested stronger disaster-related risks than observed in primary analyses. Effect modification by region and colonial status showed inconsistent but notable differences, particularly elevated maternal health risks in certain regions of Puerto Rico and compared to U.S. states. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that multiple disasters negatively affect reproductive health in Puerto Rico and that structural factors, including colonialism, may exacerbate these impacts. Public health responses must account for cumulative disaster exposure and systemic inequities to better support maternal and child health in marginalized settings, especially as climate change continues to intensify. © The Author(s) 2025.";"Child health; Climate change; Colonialism; COVID-19 pandemic; Disasters; Environmental Justice; Health inequities; Maternal health; Puerto Rico; Reproductive health; adolescent; adult; Article; child health; colonialism; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; disaster; extreme weather; female; gestational diabetes; gestational weight gain; health hazard; human; hurricane; live birth; low birth weight; major clinical study; male; maternal hypertension; maternal welfare; newborn; pandemic; pregnancy outcome; prematurity; prevalence; public health service; Puerto Rico; reproductive health; risk factor; United States; climate change; epidemiology; pregnancy; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Adult; Child Health; Climate Change; Colonialism; COVID-19; Cyclonic Storms; Disasters; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Health; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; SARS-CoV-2";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020911076&doi=10.1186%2Fs12978-025-02159-y&partnerID=40&md5=69e50a14d5ce9abb94d740d55812653f"

Displacement risk scales with the vulnerability of exposed populations, but this vulnerability is poorly understood at a global scale. Here we show that measures of human development and rural areas explain more of the variance of displacement vulnerability than income levels measured by gross domestic product. We combine global flood and displacement data to estimate vulnerability, as the ratio of displacement to exposure, for over 300 historical flood events. We find that this vulnerability varies by several orders of magnitude both between and within countries. A random forest regression shows that infant mortality rate and population density are among the most important predictors of displacement vulnerability at national level and within countries, respectively, highlighting the vulnerability of low-income and marginalized populations and of rural communities. Our results indicate that, rather than relying on overall economic development alone, targeted investments are needed to improve living conditions and coping capacities for the most vulnerable groups, particularly outside of large cities, and to prepare for increasing flood hazards due to climate change. © The Author(s) 2025.";"economic development; flooding; infant mortality; marginalization; population density; regression analysis; socioeconomic conditions; vulnerability; Article; climate change; gross national product; human; human development; lowest income group; predictive model; random forest; rural area; rural population; socioeconomics; disaster; vulnerable population; Climate Change; Disasters; Floods; Humans; Infant Mortality; Population Density; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Vulnerable Populations";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105016422718&doi=10.1038%2Fs41467-025-64015-8&partnerID=40&md5=5e1600c5051358b355bdeb320fefd73d"

As the interface between the fetal and maternal compartments during pregnancy, the placenta has been postulated to play a role in this process. We hypothesized that placental DNA methylation (DNAme) may be altered in association with natural disaster-mediated PNMS. Methods: Pooled placental samples from the Queensland Flood Study, or QF2011, cohort (n = 105) were processed for assessment of DNAme using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Results: Overall, we did not find significant associations between placental DNAme and several stress measurements using linear modelling (FDR<0.05 and Δβ>0.03). While we found that XX placentas had slightly higher predicted cytotrophoblast to syncytiotrophoblast cell ratios than XY placentas (p = 0.01), this difference in cell ratio was not associated with PNMS exposure. However, we did observe associations between placental epigenetic age acceleration and all three types of PNMS investigated (objective hardship (QFOSS) (p = 0.03), subjective distress (COSMOSS) (p = 0.03), and maternal cognitive appraisal (CONSEQ) (p = 0.0005) scores). Conclusion: The lack of large global impacts of PNMS on placental DNAme possibly indicates that the placenta can buffer moderate levels of maternal stress during pregnancy. It remains unclear what the impact of increased placental epigenetic age acceleration is on fetal development or perinatal outcomes and will require further investigation. © 2025";"DNA methylation; Epigenetic age; Maternal stress; Placenta; adult; Article; cell composition; cognitive appraisal; cohort analysis; controlled study; cytotrophoblast; DNA methylation age; epigenetics; female; fetus; fetus development; first trimester pregnancy; flooding; genetic association; gestational age; gestational diabetes; human; intrauterine growth retardation; karyotype 46,XX; karyotype 46,XY; major clinical study; male; maternal hypertension; maternal stress; natural disaster; placenta; prenatal exposure; promoter region; Queensland; second trimester pregnancy; sex difference; syncytiotrophoblast cell; third trimester pregnancy; DNA methylation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; mental stress; metabolism; pathology; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prenatal exposure delayed effect; young adult; Adult; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Floods; Humans; Placenta; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105015400365&doi=10.1016%2Fj.placenta.2025.09.003&partnerID=40&md5=ab0132cfa54688c9108d48e2b5aee6ab"

However, when prevention is not feasible, early identification of developmental impairments is paramount to address potential risk factors for future development. Specifically, one source of developmental impairment is prenatal maternal stress. This umbrella review integrates and summarizes current research on the diverse developmental consequences of prenatal maternal stress caused by natural disasters. The cumulative evidence strongly suggests that the effect of maternal stress during pregnancy does not end after pregnancy but can lead to a wide range of detrimental effects on a child's development throughout the whole lifespan. By synthesizing previous empirical findings, the current review provides an overview about potential congenital developmental difficulties as well as the interdependence of these negative effects. The depicted results highlight a risk of overarching negative effects of prenatal stress for the child. It is stated that in order to prevent possible long-lasting effects this risk has to be effectively taken into account. Possible recommendations for prevention interventions are discussed. © 2025 The Author(s).

We used California’s birth records and a quasiexperimental design to assess whether pregnant women living in affected communities during the disaster experienced more adverse birth outcomes than expected. Overall, the prevalence of low birthweight and term low birthweight were 45 to 100% higher than expected among women living in the affected communities whose late pregnancy overlapped with the blowout. The strongest effects were observed among women living directly south and southwest of the facility.

However, no study has yet explored this in the context of delay discounting (DD), which refers to the tendency to prefer smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed ones. Both prenatal factors, such as LBW, and postnatal factors, including adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and exposure to natural disasters, may influence DD. To investigate whether LBW children seek larger future rewards, we analyzed LBW's effect on DD, accounting for ACEs and natural disaster exposure. This prospective cohort study involved 167 children from areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE), with a mean age of 8.3 years at the time of the DD experiment. LBW was assessed in the 2012 baseline questionnaire using the Mother-Child Handbook, along with ACEs prior to the GEJE and traumatic earthquake experiences. In 2014, DD was assessed through a token-based experiment where children allocated tokens for either immediate rewards (one candy per token for now) or delayed rewards (two candies per token for one month later). Our results showed that children with LBW and three or more ACEs exhibited lower DD, while traumatic earthquake experiences were not associated with DD. These findings suggest that children with LBW and multiple ACEs may develop adaptive strategies to seek more resources, indicating a responsive reward system to childhood adversity, even after exposure to a severe natural disaster. © The Author(s), 2025.";"Adverse childhood experiences; delay discounting; great East Japan earthquake; low birthweight; child; childhood adversity; delay discounting; earthquake; epidemiology; female; human; Japan; low birth weight; male; natural disaster; newborn; physiology; prospective study; psychology; reward; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Child; Delay Discounting; Earthquakes; Female; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Male; Natural Disasters; Prospective Studies; Reward";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105014969491&doi=10.1017%2FS2040174425100160&partnerID=40&md5=a82b992a7319b096468f094180d18869"

However, the increasing impact of tropical cyclones on child mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), remains understudied. Methods and findings Utilizing individual-level data from the Demographic and Health Surveys, we conducted a sibling-matched case-control study to assess the impact of cyclone exposure over the past 3 months on under-five mortality. The study included 100,798 under-five deaths and 247,445 controls across 34 LMICs from 1993 to 2021. After adjusting for key meteorological and temporal confounders and maternal age, significant positive associations were observed between under-five deaths and cyclone exposure over the past 3 months before death (odds ratio [OR]: 1.038, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.002, 1.075; p=0.041). Specifically, the strongest effects were observed in the first month before death (OR: 1.101, 95% CI: 1.039, 1.166; p<0.001), diminishing in the second and third months before death. We estimated that cyclone exposure 0–30 days before death may have caused 0.85 million under-five deaths (95% CI: 0.35 million, 1.32 million) in countries exposed to cyclones from 2000 to 2020. As an observational study, its use of self-reported data and dichotomous exposure assessment may introduce recall bias and exposure misclassification, limiting accuracy and representativeness. Conclusions This global analysis demonstrates the substantial under-five mortality risk from cyclones, emphasizing the importance of targeted strategies to enhance community resilience against the growing threat of EWEs on children, such as improving access to water sources and sanitation facilities. © 2025 Guo et al.

In this study, we identify risk factors for pregnant women by undertaking the first meta-analysis on this topic, synthesising data from 42 studies with over 24 million participants. We also perform sub-group analysis on disaster type, a country's economic development, and trimester of exposure, addressing associations that can often not be examined in single studies.

PM rates from Belarus and other countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU) are analyzed here using essentially the same methods. Data and methods Perinatal mortality data for the FSU countries are available in the Health for All database (WHO). In this study, data from Ukraine, Belarus, the Russian Federation, Moldova, and Estonia are analyzed. The regression model uses a long-term exponential trend with flexible time dependence and two superimposed bell-shaped terms (Model 1). In a second approach, the bell-shaped excess terms are replaced by the inverse of gross domestic product per capita (the GDP term), which serves as a proxy for the possible impact of the socio-economic crisis after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The possible strontium exposure of pregnant women (the strontium term) is added as a second covariate (Model 2). Results Model 1 fitted the data of all five countries well. The observed increases in PM rates in the 1990s were greater in Belarus than in Ukraine and Russia. Model 2 regressions also fit the data well, except for Ukraine. In Belarus, Russia, and Moldova, the GDP term alone explained the deviation of PM rates from the predicted trend; adding the strontium term did not significantly improve the fit. Only in Ukraine and Estonia was the effect of the strontium term statistically significant. In 1987, increases in PM were found in all countries except Estonia, where PM peaked in 1988. Conclusion The deviation of PM rates in the 1990s from the long-term trend is related to GDP per capita. An effect of the strontium term is detected only in Ukraine and Estonia, where sharp increases in PM were observed in the early 1990s, well before the trough of GDP in the second half of the 1990s. © 2025 Alfred Körblein.

Following the 7.7 magnitude earthquake, extensive destruction and significant loss of life occurred across 10 provinces. This study aims to analyze the outcomes and share the surgical and radiologic algorithm applied to live, trauma-affected pregnant patients who were referred to the obstetrics and gynecology emergency department of our hospital following the earthquake. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study. The study included pregnant patients affected by the earthquake who were admitted to and/or referred to the obstetrics and gynecology emergency department of a tertiary hospital between February 6 and March 6, 2023. Demographic data, trauma-related findings, surgical details, and obstetric outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 58 pregnant earthquake victims were evaluated. The mean gestational age was 22.24±10.59 weeks. The most common obstetric complaint was pelvic pain or contractions (36.3%). Eleven patients gave birth, two via vaginal delivery and nine via cesarean section. The mean gestational age at delivery was 32.81 weeks. Curettage was performed in three patients, and hysterotomy in one patient. There were six live births and five stillbirths. In patients undergoing cesarean section, a midline incision was made. After delivery, the uterus was sutured, and intra-abdominal organs were evaluated. In cases of pelvic or other fractures, intraoperative scope devices were used. When necessary, patients were consulted by general surgery and orthopedics departments and were transferred to either the ward or the intensive care unit, depending on their clinical condition. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound has become the primary diagnostic tool for emergency evaluation in pregnant women. For earthquake victims who lack access to radiological assessment and require rapid clinical decisions, the recommended surgical approaches, particularly midline incisions, and intraoperative evaluations (such as the use of intraoperative scope after delivery) can be life-saving for both the baby and the mother. © 2025, Turkish Association of Trauma and Emergency Surgery.

However, the consequences of their failure can be catastrophic, as demonstrated by recent examples. Here this study revisits dam failures worldwide since 1900, analysing key factors driving the failure risk, profiling current dam safety and providing an outlook to the near future. Similar to previous analyses (1970s to 2010s), we observe a strong infant mortality, which remains especially important for the development of new embankment dams, while recent concrete dams have become more resilient. In contrast, hazard signals related to ageing remain yet less apparent, contrary to common belief. Nevertheless, given their abundance, we expect decades-old dams to be prevalent in future failure statistics—especially for embankment dams of height between 15 and 70 m built in the second half of the last century. This highlights the relevance of investments in monitoring, maintenance and uprating, which, if ignored, could become a substantial liability and a major vulnerability, especially in the context of increased flooding frequency. We uncover a trend of increased failure rates of newly constructed dams in low-income regions, which coincides with areas where a substantial hydropower potential remains untapped. This is especially intensified in monsoon-dominated climates, whereas the pattern of construction and failures is more homogeneous across other major climatic regions. Our statistical analysis suggests that 23 (95% confidence interval 14–33) large dam failures are to be expected worldwide in the near future (2023–2035), with currently ~4.4% of large dams having a probability of failure larger than 1/10,000.

This study aimed to investigate the association between drought and risk of infant mortality in Africa, a region highly vulnerable to climate change that bears the heaviest share of the global burden. Methods and findings: In this cross-sectional study, we obtained data on infant mortality in 34 African countries during 1992–2019 from the Demographic and Health Surveys program. We measured drought by the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index at a timescale of 24 months and a spatial resolution of 10 × 10 km, which was further dichotomized into mild and severe drought. The association between drought exposure and infant mortality risk was estimated using Cox regression models allowing time-dependent covariates. We further examined whether the association varied for neonatal and post-neonatal mortality and whether there was a delayed association with drought exposure during pregnancy or infancy. The mean (standard deviation) number of months in which children experienced any drought during pregnancy and survival period (from birth through death before 1 year of age) was 4.6 (5.2) and 7.3 (7.4) among cases and non-cases, respectively. Compared to children who did not experience drought, we did not find evidence that any drought exposure was associated with an increased risk of infant mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.00, 1.04], p = 0.072). When stratified by drought severity, we found a statistically significant association with severe drought (HR: 1.04; 95% CI [1.01, 1.07], p = 0.015), but no significant association with mild drought (HR: 1.01; 95% CI [0.99, 1.03], p = 0.353), compared to non-exposure to any drought. However, when excluding drought exposure during pregnancy, the association with severe drought was found to be non-significant. In addition, an increased risk of neonatal mortality was associated with severe drought (HR: 1.05; 95% CI [1.01, 1.10], p = 0.019), but not with mild drought (HR: 0.99; 95% CI [0.96, 1.02], p = 0.657). Conclusions: Exposure to long-term severe drought was associated with increased infant mortality risk in Africa. Our findings urge more effective adaptation measures and alleviation strategies against the adverse impact of drought on child health. © 2025 Wang et al.

Questionnaires based on a pregnancy and birth survey conducted by the Radiation Medical Science Center for the Fukushima Health Management Survey were sent to women who had received maternal and child health handbooks from municipal officers in Fukushima Prefecture. Annual data from six geographic areas in Fukushima Prefecture were separately analyzed. The number of eligible respondents, which was approximately 16,000 in 2011 when the earthquake occurred, declined temporarily the following year, recovered temporarily one year later, and has gradually declined since then. However, the response rate remained at approximately 50% throughout the decade. The incidence of preterm deliveries, low-birthweight infants, and congenital anomalies did not vary over the decade and showed a similar trend in national surveys and general reports.

These outcomes could be impacted by the disruption of healthcare and infrastructure, as well as stress and injury. Although research has focused on the impacts on neonatal health from extreme tropical events, little is known about the neonatal health impacts of moderate-intensity hurricanes or hurricanes that reduce intensity before landfall. The aim of this study is to 1) assess the causal association between hurricane exposure and the adverse birth outcomes of low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB) using a difference-in-difference analysis and 2) identify differences in spatial patterns for the adverse birth outcomes LBW and PTB pre- and post-Hurricane Isabel, a Category 2 storm that impacted North Carolina in 2003. The geospatial analysis included multiple buffers of 30, 60, and 100 km to define exposure and local spatial autocorrelation statistics. The results were predominantly insignificant, with some key exceptions. The difference-in-difference analysis found a statistically negative association between hurricane exposure and preterm birth, suggesting an unexpected reduction in preterm births post-storm. We found that exposure to Hurricane Isabel (2003) and LWB were statistically significant at the 30 and 100-km spatial buffers; exposure was also associated with a decrease in PTB at the 30 km buffer. We also examined differences in potential impacts by trimester and found a significant negative association during the second and third trimesters. Significant differences in the clustering of LBW and PTB before and after Isabel made landfall were also found, with new clusters of higher PTB and LBW forming along the storm track. Results from our study highlight the need for further analysis of neonatal and birth outcomes across different hurricane types and the need for spatial analysis to understand fine-scale heterogeneity in hurricane risk. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd";"";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85213238159&doi=10.1016%2Fj.ijdrr.2024.105075&partnerID=40&md5=108a0a29f2c237c7bb0836ab2cb63f9f"

Although there is evidence to suggest that pregnancy landscape fire exposure is associated with lower birth weight, preterm birth and pregnancy loss, there is a lack of information on many other perinatal outcomes, as well as information on subsequent respiratory outcomes in children. Furthermore, due to the generally short term (hours/days) and intermittent nature of landscape fire smoke exposure, the knowledge to date has largely relied on natural experiments and ecological studies which can be subject to misclassification of exposure and a lack of precision. On the other hand, general urban outdoor air pollution exposure during pregnancy and subsequent perinatal and respiratory effects has been well studied. In particular, as air exposure modelling has improved so have the adaptations of methods to analyze the effects of air pollution exposure during pregnancy enabling critical windows of exposure to be identified.

However, it is unclear if these outcomes are influenced by the stage of foetal development when the disaster hits. Objective: To compare the birth outcomes by trimester for those pregnant during Hurricane Florence and those in the same community 1-2 years earlier. We further assessed the role of marital status and race. Methods: We included people who gave birth between 2016–2019 in one of the coastal communities impacted by Hurricane Florence (n = 7,240). We used multiple logistic regression to determine the effects of period (hurricane or pre-hurricane) and trimester and their respective interactions on birth outcomes controlling for key demographic variables. Results: Individuals in their first trimester during the hurricane had a greater likelihood of having low-birthweight, low-APGAR, or preterm babies compared to those in the same community a year earlier and those in later trimesters during the hurricane. Unmarried individuals in their first trimester during the hurricane were particularly at risk for low-birthweight neonates. Conclusion: Increased prenatal stress associated with disasters disrupts first trimester foetal development across all groups but is most pronounced in unmarried individuals.

METHODS: This descriptive–comparative study was conducted between April and May 2023 in four state hospitals affiliated to the Ministry of Health with 82 mothers (affected by the earthquake=41, not affected by the earthquake=41) who gave birth. Data were obtained with the Personal Information Form, Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale, and Traumatic Stress Symptom Checklist. RESULTS: The mean age of the mothers who were earthquake affected in the study was 27.63±5.62. It was determined that earthquake-affected mothers gave birth prematurely and the birth weight of their infants was lower (p<0.05). It was determined that all of the earthquake-affected mothers experienced more stress according to the Traumatic Stress Symptom Checklist scale cut-off score (>25) and 73.2% of them showed more depressive symptoms according to the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale cut-off score (>13) (p<0.05). According to multivariate regression analysis, early gestational age and depressive symptoms were found to be risk factors for posttraumatic stress in mothers affected by the earthquake (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The study concluded that the earthquake-affected mothers showed depressive symptoms at least 6 weeks after giving birth, and all had increased levels of posttraumatic stress. © 2025 Associacao Medica Brasileira.

Understanding the infiltration of outdoor wildfire smoke into a residential space is critical for the accurate assessment of wildfire smoke exposure and associated health effects in pregnant people. Relying on ambient measurements of wildfire smoke alone can result in exposure misclassification. In this study, we examine the role of physical housing characteristics in the relationship between smoke exposure and preterm birth. In particular, we examine the effect of home size, year of construction, cooling type, and renovation status, as effect modifiers in the relationship between smoke exposure during pregnancy and preterm birth from 2007 to 2015 in California. To do this, we combined data on home characteristics from the California Tax Assessor, birth outcomes from the California birth records database, and the number of smoke days for each pregnancy from theNOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Hazard Mapping System (HMS). We estimated the association between smoke day exposures and odds of preterm birth using logistic regression models and stratified by air basin and housing characteristics. Our findings reveal that cooling type and renovation status are key factors modifying the smoke exposure-preterm birth relationship. Notably, we found elevated associations for people living in unrenovated homes, those using evaporative cooling systems, and those using central air conditioning units. While we observed elevated odds of preterm birth associated with increasing smoke day exposure for residents of large and new homes, this effect does not significantly differ across home size and age quartiles.

Individual flood experience was determined by matching the residential coordinates with flood events from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory database. Using data from 514,760 newborns, we found increased risks of infant mortality associated with flood exposure across multiple periods, with the risks remaining elevated for up to four years after the flood event. Overall, flood exposure was associated with 3.42 infant deaths per 1000 births in Africa from 2000 to 2020, approximately 1.7 times the burden associated with life-period exposure.

Yet, the indirect health impacts of floods on vulnerable groups, particularly women in the developing world, remain underexplored. Here, we evaluated the risk of pregnancy loss for women exposed to floods. We analyzed 90,465 individual pregnancy loss records from 33 developing countries, cross-referencing each with spatial-temporal flood databases. We found that gestational flood exposure is associated with increased pregnancy loss with an odds ratio of 1.08 (95% confidence interval: 1.04 - 1.11). This risk is pronounced for women outside the peak reproductive age range (<21 or >35) or during the mid and late-stage of pregnancy. The risk escalated for women dependent on surface water, with lower income or education levels. We estimated that, over the 2010s, gestational flood events might be responsible for approximately 107,888 (CIs: 53,944 - 148,345) excess pregnancy losses annually across 33 developing countries. Notably, there is a consistent upward trend in annual excess pregnancy losses from 2010 to 2020, and was more prominent over Central America, the Caribbean, South America, and South Asia.

Notably, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) constitute a significant determinant associated with maternal mortality and adverse birth outcomes. Despite the accumulating body of evidence, scant research has delved into the correlation between chemical components of wildfire PM<inf>2.5</inf> and the risk of HDP. Derived from data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics, singleton births from >2.68 million pregnant women were selected across 8 states (Arizona, AZ; California, CA, Idaho, ID, Montana, MT; Nevada, NV; Oregon, OR; Utah, UT, and Wyoming, WY) in the southwestern US from 2001 to 2004.

This evidence gap map (EGM) aims to identify gaps in existing knowledge and areas where further research related to climate change and its impact on maternal health is required. The following databases were searched individually from inception to present: Medline, EMBASE, and Global Health via OVID; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCOhost; Scopus; and organizational websites. In this EGM, we integrated 133 studies published in English, including qualitative, quantitative, reviews and grey literature that examined the impact of climate change on maternal health (women aged 15–45). We used Covidence to screen studies and Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (Eppi reviewer)/Eppi Mapper software to generate the EGM. Data extraction and qualitative appraisal of the studies was done using critical appraisal tools. The study protocol was registered in International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY) # INPLASY202370085. Out of 133 included studies, forty seven studies were of high quality, seventy nine moderate equality and seven low quality. This EGM found notable gaps in the literature regarding the distribution of research across regions. We found significant research in North America (51) and Asia (40 studies). However, Africa and the Caribbean had fewer studies, highlighting potential disparities in research attention and resources. Moreover, while the impact of extreme heat emerged as a prominent factor impacting maternal well-being, there is a need for further investigation into other climate-related factors such as drought. Additionally, while preterm stillbirth and maternal mortality have gained attention, there is an overlook of malnutrition and food insecurity indicators that require attention in future research. The EGM identifies existing research gaps in climate change and maternal health. It emphasizes the need for global collaboration and targeted interventions to address disparities and inform climate-responsive policies. © 2024 Meherali et al.

However, the current evidence is scarce, inconsistent, and has knowledge gaps. This study aims to estimate the associations of flood exposure before and during pregnancy with adverse birth outcomes and to identify susceptible exposure windows and effect modifiers. Methods: In this cohort study, we obtained all the birth records occurring in Greater Sydney, Australia, from Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2020, from the New South Wales Midwives Data Collection and in the Brisbane metropolitan region, Australia, from Jan 1, 1995, to Dec 31, 2014, from the Queensland Health Perinatal Data Collection. For each birth, residential address and historical flood information from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory were used to estimate the numbers of days with floods during five exposure windows (Pre-1 was defined as 13–24 weeks before the last menstrual period [LMP], Pre-2 was 0–12 weeks before the LMP, trimester 1 [Tri-1] was 0–12 weeks after the LMP, trimester 2 [Tri-2] was 13–28 weeks after the LMP, and trimester 3 [Tri-3] was ≥29 weeks after the LMP). We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) of adverse birth outcomes (preterm births, stillbirths, term low birthweight [TLBW], and small for gestational age [SGA]) associated with flood exposures in the five exposure windows using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Findings: 1 338 314 birth records were included in our analyses, which included 91 851 (6·9%) preterm births, 9831 (0·7%) stillbirths, 25 567 (1·9%) TLBW, and 108 658 (8·1%) SGA. Flood exposure in Pre-1 was associated with increased risks of TLBW (HR 1·06 [95% CI 1·01–1·12]) and SGA (1·04 [1·01–1·06]); flood exposure during Tri-1 was associated with increased risks of preterm births (1·03 [1·002–1·05]), stillbirth (1·11 [1·03–1·20]), and SGA (1·03 [1·01–1·06]). In contrast, flood exposures during Pre-2 and Tri-3 were associated with reduced risks. Interpretation: Exposures to floods in Pre-1 and Tri-1 are both associated with increased risks of adverse birth outcomes, and the risks increase with a higher exposure. Upon planning for conception and prenatal care, individuals and health practitioners should raise awareness of the increased risks of adverse birth outcomes after experiencing floods.

Few studies simultaneously evaluated exposures to these increasingly common exposures. Objectives: We investigated the relationship between exposure to heat and wildfire smoke and preterm birth (PTB). Methods: In this time-stratified case-crossover study, participants consisted of 85,806 California singleton PTBs (20–36 gestational weeks) from May through October of 2015–2019. Birthing parent ZIP codes were linked to high-resolution daily weather, PM<inf>2.5</inf> from wildfire smoke, and ambient air pollution data. Heat day was defined as a day with apparent temperature >98th percentile within each ZIP code and heat wave was defined as ≥2 consecutive heat days. Wildfire-smoke day was defined as a day with any exposure to wildfire-smoke PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing exposures during a hazard period (lags 0–6) compared to control periods. Analyses were adjusted for relative humidity, fine particles, and ozone. Results: Wildfire-smoke days were associated with 3.0% increased odds of PTB (OR<inf>lag0</inf>: 1.03, CI: 1.00–1.05). Compared with white participants, associations appeared stronger among Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indians/Alaskan Native participants. Heatwave days (OR<inf>lag2</inf>: 1.07, CI: 1.02–1.13) were positively associated with PTB, with stronger associations among those simultaneously exposed to wildfire smoke days (OR<inf>lag2</inf>: 1.19, CI: 1.11–1.27). Similar findings were observed for heat days and when other temperature metrics (e.g., maximum, minimum) were used. Discussion: Heat and wildfire increased PTB risk with evidence of synergism. As the occurrence and co-occurrence of these events increase, exposure reduction among pregnant people is critical, especially among racial/ethnic minorities. © 2024 The Authors";"Climate change; Heat; Pregnancy; Preterm birth; Smoke; Wildfires; Climate change; Codes (symbols); Fires; Obstetrics; Case crossovers; Confidence interval; Heat; Heatwaves; Odd ratios; PM 2.5; Pregnancy; Preterm birth; Wildfire; Wildfire smoke; Smoke; ozone; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; health risk; heat wave; heating; pregnancy; risk factor; smoke; wildfire; adult; air pollution; Alaska Native; American Indian; Article; Asian; Black person; California; case control study; climate change; cohort analysis; controlled study; crossover procedure; dew point temperature; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; ethnicity; female; gestational age; Hispanic; human; major clinical study; male; neighborhood; newborn; ozone depletion; PM2.5 exposure; premature labor; prematurity; relative humidity; thermal exposure; adverse event; air pollutant; epidemiology; high temperature; particulate matter; young adult; United States; Adult; Air Pollutants; Cross-Over Studies; Female; Hot Temperature; Humans; Particulate Matter; Premature Birth; Wildfires; Young Adult";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192297358&doi=10.1016%2Fj.envres.2024.119094&partnerID=40&md5=1b29404e2dd5a19bac3005bb006f8440"

A study of perinatal mortality in Belarus found a highly statistically significant increase in the 1990s in the most contaminated oblast Gomel but no increase during this period in the rest of Belarus. As a possible mechanism to interpret this increase as a late Chornobyl effect, it has been suggested that strontium-90 contained in Chornobyl fallout, incorporated during menarche, impairs the immune system of pregnant women which in turn increases perinatal mortality. In the present study, this hypothesis is tested using data from Ukraine. Methods Annual data on perinatal mortality, in the period 1981-2006 were provided by the Ministry of Public Health of Ukraine. Trends in perinatal mortality rates in the most contaminated regions of Ukraine (Kyiv and Zhytomyr oblasts and the city of Kyiv; study region) were compared with rates in the rest of Ukraine (control region). To identify any differences in perinatal mortality trends between the study and control regions, the ratios of perinatal mortality rates in the study region to the rates in the control region were analyzed using the calculated strontium concentration as a predictor. Results A trend analysis of perinatal mortality rates in Ukraine revealed two bell-shaped deviations from a long-term exponential trend with maxima at the beginning and end of the 1990s. The same pattern was found in the data from the study and control regions, but the deviations were almost three times higher in the study region than in the control region. An analysis of the ratios of perinatal mortality rates in the study region to the rates in the control region (odds ratios) showed an increase and decrease during the 1990s which was approximated by a lognormal density distribution. The calculated strontium concentration, when used as a predictor, also fitted the data well. Thus, the data from Ukraine confirms the results from Belarus. The analysis of the odds ratios revealed about 1000 excess perinatal deaths in the study region in the period 1990-2004. The corresponding figure for Ukraine as a whole was estimated at 3500 perinatal deaths. Conclusion It is hypothesized that the observed increase in perinatal mortality in the 1990s may be a late effect of incorporated strontium-90 on the immune system of pregnant women. The analysis is based on a theoretical model, as no data on strontium concentrations were available; the results should therefore be interpreted with caution. An updated study for Belarus would be desirable to corroborate the results. © 2024 Public Library of Science.

The study aims to assess the associations between wildfire air pollution and pregnancy outcomes in the Southwestern United States. Study design: This was a retrospective cohort study. Methods: Birth records of 627,404 singleton deliveries in 2018 were obtained in eight states of the Southwestern United States and were linked to wildfire-sourced fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and their constituents (black carbon [BC] and organic carbon [OC]) during the entire gestational period. A double-robust logistic regression model was used to assess the associations of wildfire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposures and preterm birth and term low birth weight, adjusting for non-fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposure and individual- and area-level confounder variables. Results: Wildfire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> contributed on average 15% of the ambient total PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations. For preterm birth, the strongest association was observed in the second trimester (odds ratio [OR]: 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05–1.07 for PM<inf>2.5</inf>; 1.06, 95% CI: 1.05–1.07 for BC; 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03–1.05 for OC, per interquartile range increment of exposure), with higher risks identified among non-smokers or those with low socio-economic status. For term low birth weight, the associations with wildfire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposures were consistently elevated for all trimesters except for the exposure averaged over the entire gestational period. Overall, the associations between wildfire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> and pregnancy outcomes were stronger than those with total PM<inf>2.5</inf>.

The effects on preterm birth during critical periods of pregnancy are unknown. Methods: We assessed associations between prenatal exposure to wildland fire smoke and risk of preterm birth (gestational age < 37 weeks). We assigned smoke exposure to geocoded residence at birth for all live singleton births in California conceived 2007–2018, using weekly average concentrations of particulate matter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) attributable to wildland fires from United States Environmental Protection Agency's Community Multiscale Air Quality Model. Logistic regression yielded odds ratio (OR) for preterm birth in relation to increases in average exposure across the whole pregnancy, each trimester, and each week of pregnancy. Models adjusted for season, age, education, race/ethnicity, medical insurance, and smoking of the birthing parent. Results: For the 5,155,026 births, higher wildland fire PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposure averaged across pregnancy, or any trimester, was associated with higher odds of preterm birth. The OR for an increase of 1 µg/m3 of average wildland fire PM<inf>2.5</inf> during pregnancy was 1.013 (95 % CI:1.008,1.017). Wildland fire PM<inf>2.5</inf> during most weeks of pregnancy was associated with higher odds. Strongest estimates were observed in weeks in the second and third trimesters. A 10 µg/m3 increase in average wildland fire PM<inf>2·5</inf> in gestational week 23 was associated with OR = 1.034; 95 % CI: 1.019, 1.049 for preterm birth.

However, a comprehensive synthesis of the current evidence on the health impacts of ambient wildfire smoke on children and adolescents, an exceptionally vulnerable population, is lacking. We conduct a systematic review of peer-reviewed epidemiological studies on the association between wildfire smoke and health of children and adolescents. Recent Findings: We searched for studies available in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus from database inception up to October 11, 2022. Of 4926 studies initially identified, 59 studies from 14 countries were ultimately eligible. Over 33.3% of the studies were conducted in the USA, and two focused on multi-countries. The exposure assessment of wildfire smoke was heterogenous, with wildfire-specific particulate matters with diameters ≤ 2.5 µm (PM<inf>2.5</inf>, 22.0%) and all-source (22.0%) PM<inf>2.5</inf> during wildfire period most frequently used. Over half of studies (50.6%) focused on respiratory-related morbidities/mortalities. Wildfire smoke exposure was consistently associated with enhanced risks of adverse health outcomes in children/adolescents. Meta-analysis results presented a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.12) for all-cause respiratory morbidity, 1.11 (95% Ci: 0.93-1.32) for asthma, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85–1.03) for bronchitis, and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.05–1.23) for upper respiratory infection, whilst − 21.71 g for birth weight (95% CI, − 32.92 to − 10.50) per 10 µg/m3 increment in wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>/all-source PM<inf>2.5</inf> during wildfire event. Summary: The majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with multiple adverse health outcomes among children and adolescents, with respiratory morbidities of significant concern. In-utero exposure to wildfire smoke may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes and have long-term impacts on height. Higher maternal baseline exposure to wildfire smoke and poor family-level baseline birthweight respectively elevated risks in preterm birth and low birth weight associated with wildfire smoke. More studies in low- and middle-income countries and focusing on extremely young children are needed. Despite technological progress, wildfire smoke exposure measurements remain uncertain, demanding improved methodologies to have more precise assessment of wildfire smoke levels and thus quantify the corresponding health impacts and guide public mitigation actions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.";"Air pollution; Children/adolescent health; Meta-analysis; Systematic reviews; Wildfire smoke; adolescent; asthma; birth weight; child; female; human; meta analysis; newborn; particulate matter; prematurity; preschool child; smoke; wildfire; Adolescent; Asthma; Birth Weight; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Particulate Matter; Premature Birth; Smoke; Wildfires";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178245716&doi=10.1007%2Fs40572-023-00420-9&partnerID=40&md5=2852d3a51cd794a27c4e93ae9cdfa47c"

Low birth weight (LBW) is a critical global health concern, contributing to neonatal mortality. However, the association between floods and LBW remains underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the association between flood hazards and LBW in India using a geospatial approach. By analyzing data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) and flood zonation maps, the study aims to uncover the spatial dynamics of this association, offering insights into the implications of floods on birth weight across diverse geographical regions. Methods: The study used the fifth round of NFHS data, 2019–21, which involved 202,194 children selected through a multi-stage stratified sampling technique. The Vulnerability Atlas of India 2019 maps were also utilized to classify areas as flood or non-flood zones. Birth weight data from the NFHS-5 were categorized into three groups: very low, low, and normal birth weight (VLBW, LBW and NBW). Control variables including flood exposure, socio-demographic attributes, and geographic region were considered. Bivariate analysis and multinomial logistic regression were employed for statistical analysis. The spatial analysis involved Moran's I statistics and Geographically Weighted Regression to explore spatial dynamics of the association between floods and birth weight in India. Results: Floods predominantly affect India's lower Himalayan belts and western coastal regions. Flood-affected areas show higher proportions of VLBW and LBW infants. Groundwater usage and unimproved sanitation are associated with higher risk of VLBW and LBW. Sex, wealth, maternal education, residence type, and geographic region significantly influence birth weights. Multinomial logistic regression reveals 8 % and 27 % higher risks for LBW and VLBW in flood-affected regions. LISA cluster maps identify high-risk areas for both LBW and floods. Geographically Weighted Regression highlights 52 % of the variability in LBW occurrences can be attributed to the influence of flood hazards. Families hailing from the poorest wealth background and exposed to flood hazards bear a 5 % heightened likelihood of delivering LBW infants, in stark contrast to their counterparts from the same economic background yet unaffected by floods. Conclusions: The significant association between floods and LBW underscores the importance of robust disaster preparedness and public health strategies. By unraveling the spatial intricacies of flood-induced LBW disparities, this research provides valuable insights for promoting healthier birth outcomes and reducing child mortality rates, particularly in flood-prone regions. These findings emphasize the importance of holistic policies that address both environmental challenges and socioeconomic inequalities to safeguard maternal and infant health across the nation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.";"Environmental health; Flood; Geospatial analysis; Low birth weight; NFHS-5; Developing countries; Disasters; Groundwater; Hazards; Health risks; Regression analysis; Birth weight; Environmental health; Flood hazards; Geo-spatial; Geo-spatial analysis; Geographics; Low birth weights; Multinomial logistic regression; NFHS-5; Spatial dynamics; Floods; ground water; disaster management; flood; health impact; health survey; holistic approach; policy approach; public health; regression analysis; sampling; spatial analysis; vulnerability; weight; Article; child health; childhood mortality; controlled study; disaster preparedness; disease association; education; exposure; female; flood exposure; flood hazard; flooding; geographic distribution; geospatial analysis; hazard; health promotion; high risk population; human; India; infant; low birth weight; major clinical study; male; maternal education; maternal welfare; pregnancy outcome; residential area; risk reduction; sanitation; seashore; sex difference; social status; sociodemographics; statistical analysis; stratified sample; very low birth weight; water supply; wealth inequality; birth weight; child; disaster; epidemiology; newborn; Birth Weight; Child; Humans; Infant; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181674778&doi=10.1016%2Fj.scitotenv.2023.169593&partnerID=40&md5=30bb12e3c340f1be2b567fa70e78b473"

Studies on epidemiology have identified correlations between PM2.5 exposure to wildfire smoke and mortality, respiratory and cardiovascular morbidities, and may result in a reduction in birth weight. However, evidence from Indonesia is limited. For this study, a retrospective cohort epidemiological study was undertaken to quantify the Indonesian population's exposure to wildfire-PM2.5. We present 9652 (88%) records of newborns to identify an association between fire-sourced PM2.5 and birth weight in Palangka Raya, Indonesia from 2015 to 2019. On an annual basis, geospatial, and season variations in wildfire-PM2.5 concentrations were observed using a satellite-based dataset from CAMS and used for gestational exposure to wildfire smoke. Applying a general linear model with birth weight (yi) as a continuous outcome, the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and low birth weight was examined. In addition, the binary outcome of low birth weight was analysed. A statistically significant difference in the birth weight reduction between infants delivered to mothers exposed to high levels of wildfire smoke and those exposed to low levels of wildfire smoke was observed over the entire time frame (2015-2019) (ρ-value < 0.001). In comparison to infants born to mothers exposed to lower concentrations, the birth weight of infants delivered to mothers exposed to high concentrations of PM2.5 in the third trimester decreased by 19.96%. A 1.9% reduction in birth weight could be caused by exposure during the fire-prevalent in the first trimester of pregnancy (ρ-value < 0.001). Since an estimation model predicted a 10 g/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure between the first and last trimesters of pregnancy, variations in the second trimester did not significantly affect the association (ρ-value = 0.761). This emphasizes the significance of foetal development during these two trimesters.

This systematic review evaluated the association between maternal exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy and the risk of perinatal, obstetric, and early childhood health outcomes. Methods: We searched CINAHL Complete, Ovid/EMBASE, Ovid/MEDLINE, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant epidemiological observational studies indexed through September 2023. The screening of titles, abstracts, and full-texts, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment was performed by pairs of independent reviewers. Results: Our systematic search yielded 28,549 records. After duplicate removal, we screened 14,009 studies, identifying 31 for inclusion in the present review. Data extraction highlighted high methodological heterogeneity between studies, including a lack of geographic variation. Approximately 56.5% and 16% originated in the United States and Brazil, respectively, and fewer in other countries. Among the studies, wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy was assessed using distance of residence from wildfire-affected areas (n = 15), measurement of air pollutant concentration during wildfires (n = 11), number of wildfire records (n = 3), aerosol index (n = 1), and geographic hot spots (n = 1). Pooled meta-analysis for birthweight and low birthweight were inconclusive, likely due to low number of methodologically homogenous studies. However, the reviewed studies provided suggestive evidence for an increased risk of birthweight reduction, low birthweight, preterm birth, and other adverse health outcomes. Conclusions: This review identified 31 studies evaluating the impacts of maternal wildfire smoke exposure on maternal, infant, and child health. Although we found suggestive evidence of harm from exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy, more methodologically homogenous studies are required to enable future meta-analysis with greater statistical power to more accurately evaluate the association between maternal wildfire smoke and adverse birth outcomes and other health outcomes. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.";"Air pollution; Birthweight; Obstetric; Pregnancy; Preterm birth; Wildfire; Air pollution; Data mining; Extraction; Fires; Health risks; Risk assessment; Search engines; Smoke; Birthweight; Early childhoods; Health outcomes; Maternal exposure; Meta-analysis; Pregnancy; Preterm birth; Systematic Review; Wildfire; Wildfire smoke; Obstetrics; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; health risk; maternal health; pollution exposure; pregnancy; risk factor; smoke; wildfire; adverse outcome; air pollutant; air pollution; birth weight; Brazil; child health; geography; human; low birth weight; maternal exposure; perinatal period; pregnancy outcome; prematurity; Review; United States; child; epidemiology; female; meta analysis; newborn; pregnancy complication; preschool child; Birth Weight; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Outcome; Premature Birth; Wildfires";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180411869&doi=10.1016%2Fj.envres.2023.117527&partnerID=40&md5=d0036ed5cc4bf8d17af3b38250abd26f"

The study of the pathogenesis of disease is impossible without establishing the factors of destabilization of biological membranes. The article highlighted the problem of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defense associated with the accumulation of radiocesium in the placenta. Objective: to determine the biochemical markers of miscarriage associated with the accumulation of137Cs in the pla-centa. Materials and methods. According to the research design, pregnant women were divided into groups. Group 1 included 153 women with reproductive losses in anamnesis and signs of termination of the current pregnancy. Group 2 (control) included 30 women with an uncomplicated pregnancy and medical history. The women of Group 1 were divided into subgroups: 1a – in which the pregnancy ended with timely delivery, despite threatening signs of termination; 1b – pregnancy ended in late premature birth; 1c – pregnancy ended in early premature birth. Accumulation of137Cs with different activity was detected in the placentas of both groups by β-spectrometry. The effect of137Cs is the activation of free radical processes. The strength of oxidative stress was studied by the content of diene conjugates (DC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the blood. The antioxidant capacity was determined by the activity of catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Biochemical studies were per-formed using a spectrophotometer «Specol-11» (Germany). Results. The increase of DC in the 1st trimester by 2.25 times, in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters by 1.25 and 1.5 times indicates the activation of free radical reactions. The trigger for late preterm births is an increase in MDA in the 1st trimester by 17.4 %. An increase in MDA by 23.4 % in the 1st trimester indicates the risk of early premature birth and intrauterine death of the fetus. A decrease in the activity of SOD in the 1st trimester by 13.0 % can be a predictor of premature birth. Decreased activity of SOD by 18.2 % in the 1st trimester indicates decompensation of adaptation mechanisms. As a result of oxidative stress caused by the accumulation of137Cs in the placenta, the activity of GST decreases almost 2 times. In the 1st trimester, catalase activity in the blood of pregnant women of the 1b and 1c subgroups was reduced by 39.2 % and 44.9 %. The dynamics of catalase in the 2nd trimester indicate the activation of adaptive reactions. After 25 weeks, catalase activity is inhibited in pregnant women of subgroups 1b and 1c due to depletion of antioxidant protection mechanisms. The activity of137Cs in the placenta above 4.5 Bq/kg causes depletion of antioxidant mechanisms, which is confirmed by persistent inhibition of catalase and SOD activity against the background of high levels of DC and MDA in the blood. Critical for pregnancy is the activity of137Cs in the placenta above 10.4 Bq/kg. Conclusions. The accumulation of137Cs in the placenta leads to the activation of lipid peroxidation beyond the capacity of the antioxidant system. Extreme effects depend on the137Cs activity and placenta compensatory ability. Indicators of MDA, DC, SOD, and catalase are prognostic regarding the power of oxidative stress and pregnancy scenarios.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study used the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Linked Birth File with hospital discharge data between 2007 and 2010. The Birth File data were merged with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection data of the same year. Spina bifida was identified by its corresponding ICD-9 code listed on the hospital discharge of the newborn. Wildfire exposure was determined based on the zip code of the woman’s home address. Pregnancy was considered exposed to wildfire if the mother lived within 15 miles of a wildfire during the pregnancy or within 30 days prior to pregnancy. Results: There were 2,093,185 births and 659 cases of spina bifida between 2007 and 2010. The births were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression models and adjusted for potential confounders. Exposure to wildfire in the first trimester was associated with higher odds of spina bifida (aOR= 1.43 [1.11–1.84], p-value = 0.01). Wildfire exposure 30 days before the last menstrual period and during the second and third trimesters were not associated with higher spina bifida risk.

Ambient pollutant concentrations, emission sources, baseline health conditions, and population sizes and distributions are all important factors that need to be taken into account to quantify local health burdens. Objectives: To determine health impacts from ambient air pollution concentrations in the United States that exceed the levels recommended by the American Thoracic Society. Methods: Using a methodology that has been well established in previous “Health of the Air” reports, this study provides policy-relevant estimates for every monitored county and city in the United States for the adverse health impacts of outdoor pollution concentrations using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency design values for years 2018–2020. Additionally, for the first time, the report includes adverse birth outcomes as well as estimates of health impacts specifically attributable to wildland fires using an exposure dataset generated through Community Multiscale Air Quality simulations. Results: The adverse health burdens attributable to air pollution occur across the entire age spectrum, including adverse birth outcomes (10,660 preterm and/or low-weight births; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3,180–18,330), in addition to mortality impacts (21,300 avoidable deaths; 95% CI, 16,180–26,200), lung cancer incidence (3,000 new cases; 95% CI, 1,550–4,390), multiple types of cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity (748,660 events; 95% CI, 326,050–1,057,080), and adversely impacted days (52.4 million days; 95% CI, 7.9–92.4 million days). Two different estimates of mortality impacts from wildland fires were created based on assumptions regarding the underlying toxicity of particles from wildland fires (low estimate of 4,080 deaths, 95% CI, 240–7,890; middle estimate of 28,000 deaths, 95% CI, 27,300–28,700). Conclusions: This year’s report identified sizable health benefits that would be expected to occur across the United States with compliance with more health-protective air quality standards such as those recommended by the American Thoracic Society. This study also indicates that a large number of excess deaths are attributable to emissions from wildland fires; air quality management strategies outside what is required by the Clean Air Act will be needed to best address this important source of air pollution and its associated health risks. © 2024 by the American Thoracic Society.";"air pollution; environmental policy; pregnancy outcome; risk assessment; wildfires; ozone; adverse health impact; air pollution; air quality; air quality standard; ambient air; American Thoracic Society; Article; birth weight; cancer incidence; cardiovascular morbidity; community multiscale air quality; death; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; environmental protection; excess mortality; exposure; government; health; health hazard; human; low birth weight; lung cancer; medical society; morbidity; mortality; outdoor air pollution; population size; pregnancy outcome; prematurity; respiratory morbidity; risk assessment; simulation; total quality management; United States; wildfire; air pollutant; environmental exposure; epidemiology; female; newborn; particulate matter; pregnancy complication; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy Complications; Wildfires";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181396087&doi=10.1513%2FAnnalsATS.202305-455OC&partnerID=40&md5=8f1afa7d27ef97b35dd408ed365a2448"

SUMMARY ANSWER: Emergency vitrification of oocytes and Day 0–Day 5 (D0–D5) embryos during disasters is a safe and effective protective measure. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: When some destructive events such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other accidents occur, emergency vitrification in embryo laboratories to protect human embryos, oocytes, and sperm is one of the important measures of an IVF emergency plan. However, there are few detailed reports on emergency vitrification in a state of disaster, especially about oocytes and D0 zygotes. Therefore, the effectiveness and safety of emergency vitrification of oocytes and D0–D5 embryos in disaster states are still unclear. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective study was made in the Reproductive Medicine Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2018 to November 2022. The record rainstorms in Zhengzhou, China, caused severe flooding, traffic disruptions, and power outages. From 17:30, 20 July 2021 to 17:30, 21 July 2021, 1246 oocytes and D0–D5 embryos of 155 patients were vitrified whilst the laboratory had only an emergency power supply. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: As of 21 December 2021, 1149 emergency vitrified oocytes and D0–D5 embryos of 124 patients underwent frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET). They were divided into the following four groups according to the days of embryo culture in vitro: oocyte group, Day 0–Day 1 (D0–D1) group, Day 2–Day 3 (D2–D3) group, and Day 4–Day 5 (D4–D5) group. Control groups for each were selected from fresh cycle patients who underwent IVF/ICSI from January 2018 to October 2021. Control and emergency vitrification patients were matched on criteria that included age, fertilization method, days of embryonic development, and number and grade of transferred embryos. A total of 493 control patients were randomly selected from the eligible patients and matched with the emergency vitrification groups in a ratio of 4:1. The results of assisted reproduction and follow-up of pregnancy were analyzed. The embryonic development, clinical outcomes, and birth outcomes in each group were statistically analyzed. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A significant difference was observed in fertilization rate (81% versus 72%, P ¼ 0.022) between the oocyte group and the control group. Significant differences were also observed in the monozygotic twin pregnancy rate (10% versus 0%, P ¼ 0.038) and ectopic pregnancy rate (5% versus 0%, P ¼ 0.039) between the D0–D1 group and the control group. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed between vitrified oocytes/D0–D1 embryos/D2–D3 embryos and the control group on the number of high-quality embryos (3.17 ± 3.00 versus 3.84 ± 3.01, P ¼ 0.346; 5.04 ± 3.66 versus 4.56 ± 2.87, P ¼ 0.346; 4.85 ± 5.36 versus 5.04 ± 4.64, P ¼ 0.839), the number of usable blastocysts (1.22 ± 1.78 versus 1.21 ± 2.03, P ¼ 0.981; 2.16 ± 2.26 versus 1.55 ± 2.08, P ¼ 0.090; 2.82 ± 3.23 versus 2.58 ± 3.32, P ¼ 0.706), clinical pregnancy rate (56% versus 57%, P ¼ 0.915; 55% versus 55%, P ¼ 1.000; 40% versus 50%, P ¼ 0.488), miscarriage rate (30% versus 15%, P ¼ 0.496; 5% versus 11%, P ¼ 0.678; 17% versus 20%, P ¼ 1.000), and live birth rate (39% versus 49%, P ¼ 0.460; 53% versus 50%, P ¼ 0.772; 33% versus 40%, P ¼ 0.635). No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed between the D4–D5 group and the control group on clinical pregnancy rate (40% versus 55%, P ¼ 0.645), miscarriage rate (0% versus 18%, P ¼ 1.000), and live birth rate (40% versus 45%, P ¼ 1.000) LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The retrospective study design is a limitation. The timing and extent of natural disasters are unpredictable, so the sample size of vitrified oocytes, zygotes, and embryos is beyond experimental control. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study is the first study analyzing embryonic development, clinical outcomes, and birth outcomes of large samples of oocytes, D0 zygotes, and D1–D5 embryos after emergency vitrification under the disaster conditions. The results show that emergency vitrification is a safe and effective protective measure applicable to oocytes and D0–D5 embryos. The embryology laboratories need to be equipped with an emergency uninterrupted power supply capable of delivering for 6–8 h at full load.

Despite the widespread impact of these events, knowledge about their effects on pregnancy outcomes is scarce and inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the available evidence, estimate the overall effect, and identify key research gaps about earthquake on pregnant women. Study Design: A comprehensive search of English-language peer-reviewed articles was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection. Various combinations of keywords related to earthquakes and pregnancy outcomes were used. Studies comparing quantitative data on pregnancy outcomes between earthquake-affected and unaffected pregnant women were included. Random and fixed-effects models were used to estimate the pooled effect size. Results: The meta-analysis revealed no significant difference in preterm delivery rates (OR: 1.18; 95 % CI: 0.94–1.47; I2 = 75 %; five studies, 26,365 women) and low birth weight (LBW) infant delivery rates (OR: 1.19; 95 % CI: 0.83–1.71; I2 = 72 %; three studies, 16,127 women) between the earthquake-affected and control groups. However, a statistically significant increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants was observed in the earthquake-affected group (OR: 1.25; 95 % CI: 1.08–1.43; I2 = 0 %; two studies, 10,238 women). Data on miscarriage and stillbirth rates were not suitable for meta-analysis. Conclusions: Limited evidence suggests that exposure to earthquakes may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm the increased risk of SGA in the affected population and to inform disaster management plans by enhancing our understanding of the adversities associated with earthquake exposure through more comprehensive epidemiologic research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.";"Earthquake; Low birth weight; Miscarriage; Perinatal outcomes; Preterm delivery; Small for gestational age; corticotropin releasing factor; acute stress; adverse outcome; chronic stress; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; earthquake; female; fetus growth; first trimester pregnancy; human; infant; low birth weight; meta analysis; newborn; obstetric delivery; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; premature labor; retrospective study; Review; small for gestational age; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; systematic review; pregnancy; prematurity; Earthquakes; Female; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Pregnant Women; Premature Birth; Stillbirth";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173675744&doi=10.1016%2Fj.ejogrb.2023.10.002&partnerID=40&md5=92e97771def255e6aa46bebcc26f234d"

Methods: Cyclone Fani hit the coast of Odisha on May 3, 2019. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 5 districts and targeted the babies discharged from SNCU's from January to May 2019. A telephonic interview of the caregivers was conducted to assess the health status of the newborns. Data was collected in a web-based portal and analyzed by statistical package for social sciences SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). Results: We inquired about 1840 babies during the study period but only 875 babies could be followed up, with the highest proportion of the babies from the most affected district. Out of 875 babies, 111 (12.7%) had 1 or more illnesses during follow up. Distance from the health facility and time constraints were the major reasons for not seeking health care. Of the babies, 35.7% were reported as being underweight. Poor breastfeeding (14.1%) and kangaroo mother care (31.7%) practices were reported. Only 32% of the babies were completely immunized. Conclusion: The health status of the babies discharged from the SNCUs was found to be poor.

However, the burden of stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> is unknown. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is a co-occurrence of high baseline stillbirth rates and frequent firestorms, which may lead to a geographic disparity. Across 54 LMICs, we conducted a self-matched case-control study, making stillbirths comparable to the corresponding livebirths in terms of time-invariant characteristics (e.g., genetics) and duration of gestational exposure. We established a joint-exposure-response function (JERF) by simultaneously associating stillbirth with fire- and non-fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations, which were estimated by fusing multi-source data, such as chemical transport model simulations and satellite observations. During 2000–2014, 35,590 pregnancies were selected from multiple Demographic and Health Surveys. In each mother, a case of stillbirth was compared to her livebirth(s) based on gestational exposure to fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf>. We further applied the JERF to assess stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> in 136 non-Western countries. The disparity was evaluated using the Gini index. The risk of stillbirth increased by 17.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6–35.7%) per 10 μg/m3 increase in fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf>. In 2014, referring to a minimum-risk exposure level of 10 μg/m3, total and fire-sourced PM<inf>2.5</inf> contributed to 922,860 (95% CI: 578,451–1,183,720) and 49,951 (95% CI: 3,634–92,629) stillbirths, of which 10% were clustered within the 6.4% and 0.6% highest-exposure pregnancies, respectively.

A comprehensive review is urgently needed to summa-rize and update the evidence on the health effects of cyclones. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to provide a systematic review with meta-analysis of current evidence on the risks of all reported health outcomes related to cyclones and to identify research gaps and make recommendations for further research. METHODS: We systematically searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies in English published before 21 December 2022. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guide-lines, we developed inclusion criteria, screened the literature, and included epidemiological studies with a quantitative risk assessment of any mortality or morbidity-related outcomes associated with cyclone exposures. We extracted key data and assessed study quality for these studies and applied meta-analyses to quantify the overall effect estimate and the heterogeneity of comparable studies. RESULTS: In total, 71 studies from eight countries (the United States, China, India, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Australia, Brazil), mostly the United States, were included in the review. These studies investigated the all-cause and cause-specific mortality, as well as morbidity related to injury, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, mental disorders, adverse birth outcomes, cancer, diabetes, and other outcomes (e.g., suicide rates, gender-based violence). Studies mostly included only one high-amplitude cyclone (cyclones with a Saffir–Simpson category of 4 or 5, i.e., Hurricanes Katrina or Sandy) and focused on mental disorders morbidity and all-cause mortality and hospitalizations. Consistently elevated risks of overall mental health morbidity, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as all-cause mortality or hospitalizations, were found to be associated with cyclones. However, the results for other outcomes were generally mixed or limited. A statistically significant overall relative risk of 1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.13], 1.18 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.25), 1.15 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.18), 1.26 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.50) was observed for all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalizations, respiratory disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospitalizations, respectively, after cyclone exposures, whereas no statistically significant risks were identified for diabetes mortality, heart disease mortality, and preterm birth. High between-study heterogeneity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: There is generally consistent evidence supporting the notion that high-amplitude cyclones could significantly increase risks of mental disorders, especially for PTSD, as well as mortality and hospitalizations, but the evidence for other health outcomes, such as chronic diseases (e.g., CVDs, cancer, diabetes), and adverse birth outcomes remains limited or inconsistent. More studies with rigorous exposure assessment, of larger spa-tial and temporal scales, and using advanced modeling strategy are warranted in the future, especially for those small cyclone-prone countries or regions with low and middle incomes. © 2023, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Methods: In this retrospective descriptive study, before and after the earthquake, 550 and 450 women were enrolled respectively. Neonatal weight, height, and head circumference, as well as maternal weight gain and hemoglobin (Hb) levels were obtained using medical records at health centers. Chi-square test and Independent t-test were used to analyze differences in pregnancy outcomes. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: A significant increase in inadequate gestational weight gain (44.1% vs 58.9%) was observed (P = 0.043) before and after the earthquake. The mean hemoglobin level in the first trimester before the earthquake was significantly higher than after the earthquake (P = 0.001). Before-after earthquake comparisons showed that the mean birth weight, birth height, and birth head circumference were decreased significantly (P < 0.05). In addition, the rates of preterm birth (18.91% vs 10.90%), abortion (17.11% vs 10.54%), and stillbirth (3.78% vs 1.82%) were increased significantly after the earthquake (P < 0.05).

Objective: We aimed to estimate the risk and burden of preterm birth/term low birth weight, associated with maternal exposure to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Methods: A total of 330,884 birth records with maternal information were collected from the New South Wales Australia from 2015 to 2019, covering 523 residential communities. Daily wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> at a 0.25° × 0.25° (≈ 25 km × 25 km) resolution was estimated by a machine learning method combining 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and reanalysis meteorological data. Cox proportional hazards models were implemented to evaluate the association between wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> and preterm birth/term low birth weight. Number and fraction of preterm birth/term low birth weight attributable to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> during pregnancy were calculated. Results: Per one interquartile-range rise in wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> was found to be associated with 6.9% (HR: 1.069, 95% CI: 1.058–1.081) increased risk of preterm birth and 3.6% (HR: 1.036, 95% CI: 1.014–1.058) higher risk of term low birth weight. The most susceptible gestational window was the 2nd trimester for preterm birth whereas the 1st for term low birth weight. We estimated that 14.30% preterm births and 8.04% term low birth weight cases were attributable to maternal exposure to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf> during the whole pregnancy. Male infants and mothers aged ≥ 40, experiencing temperature extremes or living in the inner region, and concepted during spring had higher risks of preterm birth/term low birth weight associated with wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Comparatively, mothers with advanced age have a higher risk of preterm birth while younger mothers were more likely to deliver term newborns with low birth weight, when being exposed to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Pregnancy-induced hypertension enhanced the risk of preterm birth associated with wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Conclusions: This study strengthened robust evidence on the enhanced risk of preterm birth/term low birth weight associated with maternal exposure to wildfire-specific PM<inf>2.5</inf>.

However, it is not known how this affected the seasonal changes of pregnancy and childbirth. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of the GEJE in the Fukushima Prefecture on spontaneous and induced abortions with regard to seasonal variability. Methods: We used the data of vital statistics of live birth and stillbirth registry and the census survey of the Fukushima Maternity Care Facility. We calculated the spontaneous and induced abortion rate for 2011–2016 using two different methods (cross-sectional and longitudinal). We calculated the quartiles and outliers to determine the impact and duration of the GEJE. Periodicity was investigated using spectral density analysis. The data were analyzed for the entire Fukushima Prefecture and by region. Results: The spontaneous abortion rate did not show specific changes after the GEJE. Contrarily, the monthly analysis in the cross-sectional method, revealed specific increases in induced abortion rate during the year after the GEJE; in the longitudinal method, induced abortions increased among women who became pregnant within 1 year after the GEJE. Spontaneous abortion showed no specific periodicity, while induced abortion showed cycles of 6 and 12 months, with a particular increase in May each year. Conclusions: The spontaneous abortion rate was not affected by the GEJE. The changes in the induced abortion rate after the disaster may have overlapped with the timing of the increased periodicity, and cannot be attributed solely to the GEJE. © 2023 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.";"disasters; induced abortion; periodicity; pregnant; spontaneous abortion; Article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; earthquake; environmental impact; female; gestational age; health care facility; health survey; human; induced abortion; Japan; live birth; longitudinal study; periodicity; population structure; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; seasonal variation; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; trend study; vital statistics; Fukushima nuclear accident; maternal health service; population research; pregnancy; Abortion, Induced; Abortion, Spontaneous; Censuses; Cross-Sectional Studies; Earthquakes; Female; Fukushima Nuclear Accident; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Maternal Health Services; Pregnancy; Vital Statistics";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145423163&doi=10.1111%2Fjog.15529&partnerID=40&md5=82718dc61f996309d14fe33c13c43980"

Environmental exposures related to climate change have a disproportionate effect on pregnant women through influencing food and water security, civil conflicts, extreme weather events, and the spread of disease. Our research team sought to identify the current peer-reviewed research on the effects of climate change-related environmental exposures on perinatal and maternal health in the United States. Design and Methods: A systematic literature review of publications identified through a comprehensive search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases was conducted using a modified Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach. The initial search across both databases identified a combined total of 768 publications. We removed 126 duplicates and 1 quadruplet, and the remaining 639 publications were subjected to our pre-set inclusion and exclusion criteria. We excluded studies outside of the United States. A total of 39 studies met our inclusion criteria and were retained for thematic analysis. Findings: A total of 19 studies investigated the effect of either hot or cold temperature exposure on perinatal and maternal health outcomes. The effect of air pollution on perinatal outcomes was examined in five studies. A total of 19 studies evaluated the association between natural disasters (hurricanes, flash floods, and tropical cyclones) and perinatal and maternal health outcomes. High and low temperature extremes were found to negatively influence neonate and maternal health. Significant associations were found between air pollutant exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were linked to hurricanes, tropical cyclones, and flash floods. Conclusions: This systematic review suggests that climate change-related environmental exposures, including extreme temperatures, air pollution, and natural disasters, are significantly associated with adverse perinatal and maternal health outcomes across the United States. © 2023 by the authors.";"air pollution; birth outcomes; climate change; mental health; natural disasters; perinatal and maternal health; temperature; atmospheric pollution; climate change; health risk; maternal health; mental health; natural disaster; pollution exposure; temperature anomaly; adverse outcome; air pollutant; air pollution; child health; cold; environmental exposure; extreme cold weather; extreme hot weather; flash flood; flooding; high temperature; human; hurricane; maternal welfare; Medline; peer review; perinatal care; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; pregnancy outcome; publication; Review; systematic review; United States; Web of Science; adverse event; epidemiology; female; newborn; pregnancy; Climate Change; Environmental Exposure; Female; Floods; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147860609&doi=10.3390%2Fijerph20031662&partnerID=40&md5=43a45e47f1fcb002b473ddef5b62700c"

Annual monsoons bring extensive flooding to the basin, with floods predicted to be more frequent and extreme due to climate change. Yet, evidence regarding the long-term impacts of floods on children’s health is lacking. In this analysis, we used high-resolution maps of recent large floods in Bangladesh to identify flood-prone areas over the country. We then used propensity score techniques to identify, among 58, 945 mothers interviewed in six demographic population-based surveys throughout Bangladesh, matched cohorts of exposed and unexposed mothers and leverage data on 150, 081 births to estimate that living in flood-prone areas was associated with an excess risk in infant mortality of 5.3 (95% CI 2.2 to 8.4) additional deaths per 1, 000 births compared to living in non-flood-prone areas over the 30-y period between 1988 and 2017, with higher risk for children born during rainy (7.9, 95% CI: 3.3 to 12.5) vs. dry months (3.1, 95% CI: –1.1 to 7.2). Finally, drawing on national-scale, high-resolution estimates of flood risk and population distribution, we estimated an excess of 152, 753 (64, 120 to 241, 386) infant deaths were attributable to living in flood-prone areas in Bangladesh over the past 30 y, with marked heterogeneity in attributable burden by subdistrict.

Methods: The participants were 13,148 pregnant women recruited from 2013 to 2017. The women were classified into three groups by the severity of housing damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011: group A, house was not destroyed/did not live in the disaster area; group B, half/part of the house was destroyed; and group C, house was totally/ mostly destroyed. Maternal characteristics, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and gestational weeks were obtained using questionnaires and medical records. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the relation between disaster exposure and maternal characteristics, HDP, and GDM. A structural equation model was applied to investigate the relation of disaster exposure with HDP and gestational weeks. Results: The homes of about 11% of the women were totally/mostly destroyed. For groups B and C compared with those in group A, the adjusted ORs for HDP were 1.04 and 1.26 (P for trend = 0.01), and for GDM were 0.89 and 1.14 (P for trend = 0.9), respectively. Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) mediated 23.2% of the relation between disaster exposure and HDP. Disaster exposure was associated with gestational weeks. Conclusion: Disaster exposure at least 2.5 years before pregnancy was found to be associated with maternal characteristics and the prevalence of HDP.

Adverse birth outcomes increase and male livebirths decrease after environmental disasters, economic crises, and terrorist events. We hypothesized the ratio of male to female livebirths would decrease in areas affected by severe tropical cyclones (TCs) in Queensland, Australia. Additionally, in male livebirths, there would be an increase in preterm and low birthweight births. Lastly, we hypothesized that the pregnancy stage at which exposure occurred would modify the association between TC exposure and observed outcomes. Methods: Interrupted time series analysis was used to analyze Queensland administrative birth records from July 2007 to June 2018 for significant changes in the sex ratio at birth, measured as the proportion of male livebirths. Adjusted generalized linear models were fitted to births in areas affected by two category five TCs: cyclones Yasi (February 2011) and Marcia (February 2015). To explore male mortality and morbidity risk, additional analysis was conducted on the proportion of male stillborn, low birthweight, and preterm births. The association between estimated pregnancy stage during the TC and the proportion of male births was also analyzed. Results: Contrary to our hypothesis, increases in the proportion of male livebirths were observed following early-pregnancy exposure to cyclone Yasi and mid-pregnancy exposure to Marcia, although the latter was not statistically significant. No significant changes were observed in proportions of male stillborn, low birthweight, and preterm births. Conclusions: This study found a significant association between severe TCs and sex ratio at birth. The stage of pregnancy at which maternal stressors were experienced modified this association. Among people exposed in early to mid-pregnancy, the proportion of male births was higher. This may be because of differential loss of females in utero. Studying sex differences in birth outcomes provides insight into in utero vulnerabilities associated with environmental stressors. Climate change is increasing the intensity and frequency of natural disasters. Understanding fetal vulnerability to environmental stressors will provide crucial information supporting early life health interventions that mitigate the immediate and long-term effects. © 2022 The Authors.

This review includes epidemiologic and experimental laboratory-based studies of WS, air pollution, particulate matter (PM), and other chemicals related to combustion in relation to obstetric outcomes and placental biology. We summarized the available clinical, animal, and placental studies with WS and other combustion products such as tobacco, diesel, and wood smoke. Additionally, we reviewed current recommendations for prevention of WS exposure. We found that there is limited data specific to WS; however, studies on air pollution and other combustion sources suggest a link to inflammation, oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, DNA damage, telomere shortening, epigenetic changes, as well as metabolic, vascular, and endothelial dysregulation in the maternal-fetal unit. These alterations in placental biology contribute to adverse obstetric outcomes that disproportionally affect the most vulnerable.

Childbearing women, that is, women who are pregnant, soon to be pregnant, or have recently given birth, may be particularly vulnerable to the effect of wildfire exposure. OBJECTIVES: This review sought to systematically assess what is known about birth outcomes, health, and health care needs of childbearing women during and after exposure to wildfires. METHODS: An integrative review methodology was utilized to enable article selection, data extraction, and synthesis across qualitative and quantita-tive studies. Comprehensive searches of SCOPUS (including MEDLINE and Embase), CINAHL, PubMed, and Google Scholar identified studies for inclusion with no date restriction. Included studies were independently appraised by two reviewers using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool. The findings are summarized and illustrated in tables. RESULTS: Database searches identified 480 records. Following title, abstract, and full text screening, sixteen studies published between 2012 and 2022 were identified for this review. Eleven studies considered an association between in utero exposure to wildfire and impacts on birth weight and length of gestation. One study reported increased rates of maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and gestational hypertension following exposure; whereas one study reported differences in the secondary sex ratio. Two studies reported higher incidence of birth defects following in utero exposure to wildfire smoke. Three studies reported increased mental health morbidity, and one study associated a reduction in breastfeeding among women who evac-uated from a wildfire disaster. DISCUSSION: Evidence indicates that wildfire exposure may be associated with changes to birth outcomes and increased morbidity for childbearing women and their babies. These effects may be profound and have long-term and wide-ranging public health implications. This research can inform the development of effective clinical and public health strategies to address the needs of childbearing women exposed to wildfire disaster. https://doi. org/10.1289/EHP10544. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

A growing body of evidence demonstrated associations between air pollution exposure during pregnancy and birth defects. To date, there is no study looking at birth defects and exposure to wildfire-related air pollution, which is suggested as a type of air pollution source with high toxicity for reproductive health. Objective: Our study addresses this gap by examining the association between birth defects and wildfire smoke exposure in Brazil between 2001 and 2018. Based on known differences of impacts of wildfires across different regions of Brazil, we hypothesized differences in risks of birth defects for different regions. Methods: We used a logistic regression model to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for individual birth defects (12 categories) associated with wildfire exposure during each trimester of pregnancy. Results: Among the 16,825,497 birth records in our study population, there were a total of 7595 infants born in Brazil between 2001 and 2018 with birth defects in any of the selected categories. After adjusting for several confounders in the primary analysis, we found statistically significant OR for three birth defects, including cleft lip/cleft palate [OR: 1.007 (95% CI: 1.001; 1.013)] during the second trimester of exposure, congenital anomalies of the respiratory system [OR: 1.013 (95% CI: 1.002; 1.023)] in the second trimester of exposure, and congenital anomalies of the nervous system [OR: 1.002 (95% CI: 1.001; 1.003)] during the first trimester of exposure for the regions South, North, and Midwest, respectively. Significance: Our results suggest that maternal exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of an infant being born with some congenital anomaly. Considering that birth defects are associated with long-term disability, impacting families and the healthcare system (e.g., healthcare costs), our findings should be of great concern to the public health community. Impact statement: Our study focused on the association between maternal exposure to wildfire smoke in Brazil during pregnancy and the risk of an infant being born with congenital anomalies, which presents serious public health and environmental challenges. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.";"Air pollution; Birth defects; Pregnancy; Smoke; Wildfire; adult; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; Brazil; child; epidemiology; female; human; infant; maternal exposure; newborn; particulate matter; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; smoke; wildfire; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Child; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Exposure; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Smoke; Wildfires";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114621537&doi=10.1038%2Fs41370-021-00380-y&partnerID=40&md5=a3bc4b145622251e0bf07fac98e46ac5"

This review summarizes recent literature regarding the impacts of climate change and related environmental disasters on pregnancy health and provides recommendations to inform future adaptation and mitigation efforts. Recent Findings: Accumulating evidence suggests that the changing climate affects pregnancy health directly via discrete environmental disasters (i.e., wildfire, extreme heat, hurricane, flood, and drought), and indirectly through changes in the natural and social environment. Although studies vary greatly in design, analytic methods, and assessment strategies, they generally converge to suggest that climate-related disasters are associated with increased risk of gestational complication, pregnancy loss, restricted fetal growth, low birthweight, preterm birth, and selected delivery/newborn complications. Window(s) of exposure with the highest sensitivity are not clear, but both acute and chronic exposures appear important. Furthermore, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations may be more vulnerable. Summary: Policy, clinical, and research strategies for adaptation and mitigation should be continued, strengthened, and expanded with cross-disciplinary efforts. Top priorities should include (a) reinforcing and expanding policies to further reduce emission, (b) increasing awareness and education resources for healthcare providers and the public, (c) facilitating access to quality population-based data in low-resource areas, and (d) research efforts to better understand mechanisms of effects, identify susceptible populations and windows of exposure, explore interactive impacts of multiple exposures, and develop novel methods to better quantify pregnancy health impacts. © 2022, The Author(s).";"Climate change; Environmental disaster; Extreme weather; Perinatal health; Pregnancy health; climate change; disaster; female; flooding; human; hurricane; newborn; pregnancy; prematurity; Climate Change; Cyclonic Storms; Disasters; Female; Floods; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Premature Birth";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124971084&doi=10.1007%2Fs40572-022-00345-9&partnerID=40&md5=f4732e5a3cffd6a22d9471d07b1916e7"

Wildfire smoke has been suggested as a type of air pollution source with high toxicity for reproductive health. In this study, we estimated the association between preterm birth and wildfire periods in Brazil, a country included in the list of the 10 nations with the greatest number of preterm birth and also considered as a very fire-prone region. We applied a time-stratified case-crossover study design using conditional logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratio for preterm birth associated with wildfire-related prenatal PM<inf>2.5</inf>, during different windows of exposure, including trimesters 1–3. After adjusting for several confounders (other air pollutants, demographics, meteorological variables, and spatiotemporal terms), we found that wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy may be associated with preterm birth in Brazil. Southeast was the region with the highest increase in the odds of PTB (OR:1.41 (95%CI: 1.31–1.51) when the exposure occurred in the first trimester. In the North, exposure to PM<inf>2.5</inf> during wildfire periods in the second trimester of pregnancy was associated with increased odds of PTB (OR:1.05 (95%CI: 1.01–1.09) in preterm birth when the exposure occurred in the second trimester. This study suggests that wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy may increase the risk for preterm birth in Brazil.

An increased study region is chosen, and the study period is extended to 2019. Methods: Japanese monthly perinatal mortality data are provided on a prefecture level by the Japanese government. The study region consists of 12 prefectures around the FDNPP; the rest of Japan is used as the control region. A combined non-linear regression of perinatal mortality rates in the study- and control regions is conducted. The regression model allows for a common asymptotic lower limit of perinatal mortality, seasonal variations, and periodic peaks in 2012-2019 in the study region. To determine the dependency of the effect on distance from the FDNPP, the study region is divided into four core prefectures and eight prefectures surrounding the core prefectures. Results: Perinatal mortality rates in the study region show a significant 6.4% (95% CI: 1.8%, 13.4%) overall increase in 2012-2019 relative to the trend in preceding years with no attenuation during 2012-19. The increase translates to 590 (165, 1226) excess perinatal deaths (p = 0.016). It is characterized by annual peaks with maxima in April. A 13.6% increase is determined in the four core prefectures and a 4.3% increase in eight prefectures surrounding the core prefectures. Before 2012, there is a peak around April 2011 and a decline in October 2011; another significant peak is detected in November 2012. In the 4 core prefectures, large increases are found in the first quarter of 2018 (+70%) and in May 2019 (+130%). Conclusion: This study finds periodic peaks in perinatal mortality in spring 2012-2019 in 12 prefectures of Japan surrounding the FDNPP. In light of massive increases in 2018 and 2019 in the four core prefectures, continued investigation of perinatal mortality in contaminated regions of Japan is recommended.

These wildfires burned approximately 23,794 hectares of forestland over several days. We investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to the by-products generated by wildfire disasters on birth weight. METHODS: Birth weight data were obtained for 1999-2001 from the birth registration database of the Korean National Statistical Office and matched with the zip code and exposed/unexposed pregnancy week for days of the wildfires. Generalized linear models were then used to assess the associations between birth weight and exposure to wildfires after adjusting for fetal sex, gestational age, parity, maternal age, maternal education, paternal education, and average exposed atmospheric temperature. RESULTS: Compared with unexposed pregnancies before and after the wildfires, mean birth weight decreased by 41.4 g (95% confidence interval [CI], -72.4 to -10.4) after wildfire exposure during the first trimester, 23.2 g (95% CI, -59.3 to 13.0) for exposure during the second trimester, and 27.0 g (95% CI, -63.8 to 9.8) during the third trimester. In the adjusted model for infants exposed in utero during any trimester, the mean birth weight decreased by 32.5 g (95% CI, -53.2 to -11.7). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a 1% reduction in birth weight after wildfire exposure.

Methods: Data from the Pregnancy and Birth Survey and Basic Survey in the FHMS were combined to analyze external maternal radiation exposure following the FDND, and the relationship between radiation dose and perinatal outcomes was analyzed using binomial logistic regression analysis. Missing dose data were supplemented using multiple imputation. Results: A total of 6,875 individuals responded to the survey. Congenital anomalies occurred in 2.9% of patients, low birth weight (LBW) in 7.6%, small for gestation age (SGA; <10th percentile) in 8.9%, and preterm birth in 4.1%. The median maternal external radiation dose was 0.5 mSv (maximum, 5.2 mSv). Doses were classified as follows: <1 mSv (reference), 1 to <2 mSv, and ≥2 mSv. For congenital anomalies, the crude odds ratio for 1 to <2 mSv was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56–1.17) (no participants with congenital anomaly were exposed to ≥2 mSv). At 1 to <2 mSv and ≥2 mSv, the respective adjusted odds ratios were 0.91 (95% CI, 0.71–1.18) and 1.21 (95% CI, 0.53–2.79) for LBW, 1.14 (95% CI, 0.92–1.42) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.30–2.37) for SGA, and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.65–1.29) and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.22–4.87) for preterm birth.

The annual population-based Pregnancy and Birth Survey is conducted as part of the Fukushima Health Management Survey. The Fukushima Prefecture government launched it to assess the health conditions of pregnant women and their neonates after the GEJE. The self-reported questionnaire was sent to 115,976 pregnant women by mail from January 2012, with 58,344 women responding to the questionnaire (50.3% response rate). Pregnancy complications, such as gestational hypertension, respiratory diseases, and mental disorders, increased in some women who were pregnant at the time of the earthquake and immediately after the earthquake. However, the direct effects on newborns, such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and congenital anomalies, were not immediately clear after the earthquake. Although there were significant differences in the occurrence of preterm birth and low birth weight among the districts, there was no change in the occurrences of preterm birth, low birth weight, or anomalies in newborns in Fukushima Prefecture from the fiscal year 2011 to the fiscal year 2018.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of abortion, stillbirth, and congenital anomaly data for pregnancies in Hungary between 1 January 1981 and 31 December 1991 was conducted. Results: Trend analysis revealed increasing trends in spontaneous and voluntary abortion rates in Hungary during the study time period, while late pregnancy losses showed a decreasing trend. Overall, there were generally decreasing incidence rates for birth defects throughout the 1980s. Increased voluntary abortions over the study period might reflect, at least in part, maternal anxiety in the post-Chernobyl years. Decreased late pregnancy loss over the same period may be attributable to improvements in prenatal diagnostics. A notable weakness of this study is that missing data could not be complemented due to the decades that have passed since the incident.

In order to investigate this relationship, data on every singleton birth in California 2006–2012 were combined with satellite-based estimates of wildfire smoke plume boundaries and high-resolution gridded estimates of surface PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations and a regression model was used to estimate associations with preterm birth risk. Results suggest that each additional day of exposure to any wildfire smoke during pregnancy was associated with an 0.49 % (95 % CI: 0.41–0.59 %) increase in risk of preterm birth (<37 weeks). At sample median smoke exposure (7 days) this translated to a 3.4 % increase in risk, relative to an unexposed mother. Estimates by trimester suggest stronger associations with exposure later in pregnancy and estimates by smoke intensity indicate that observed associations were driven by higher intensity smoke-days. Exposure to low intensity smoke-days had no association with preterm birth while an additional medium (smoke PM<inf>2.5</inf> 5–10 μg/m3) or high (smoke PM<inf>2.5</inf> > 10 μg/m3) intensity smoke-day was associated with an 0.95 % (95 % CI: 0.47–1.42 %) and 0.82 % (95 % CI: 0.41–1.24 %) increase in preterm risk, respectively. In contrast to previous findings for other pollution types, neither exposure to smoke nor the relative impact of smoke on preterm birth differed by race/ethnicity or income in our sample. However, impacts differed greatly by baseline smoke exposure, with mothers in regions with infrequent smoke exposure experiencing substantially larger impacts from an additional smoke-day than mothers in regions where smoke is more common. We estimate 6,974 (95 % CI: 5,513–8,437) excess preterm births attributable to wildfire smoke exposure 2007–2012, accounting for 3.7 % of observed preterm births during this period.

We examined 76,152 pregnant women including 8270 in Miyagi Regional Center and 67,882 in 13 other regional centers from the all-birth fixed data of the Japan Environment and Children’s Study. We then compared the prevalence and risk of distress in women in Miyagi Regional Center and women in the 13 regional centers for 3 years after the disaster.

Despite the recent hike in the intensity and frequency of wildfires in some regions of the world, a critical appraisal of the evidence on the association between maternal wildfire exposure and adverse birth outcomes has not yet been undertaken. We conducted a systematic review that evaluated the scientific evidence on the association between wildfire exposure during pregnancy and the risk of adverse birth outcomes. Methods: Comprehensive searches in nine bibliographic databases were conducted from database inception up to June 2020. Observational epidemiological studies that evaluated associations between exposure to wildfire during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes were eligible for inclusion. Studies were assessed using the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP OHAT) risk of bias tool and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Screening of retrieved articles, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Study results were synthesized descriptively. Results: Eight epidemiological studies conducted in four countries and involving 1,702,252 births were included in the review. The exposure to wildfire during pregnancy was assessed in individual studies by measurement of PM<inf>2.5</inf> (n = 2), PM<inf>10</inf> (n = 1), Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aerosol index (n = 1), heat spots (n = 1), and by proximity of maternal residence to wildfire-affected areas (n = 3). There is some evidence indicating that maternal wildfire exposure associates with birth weight reduction (n = 7) and preterm birth (n = 4), particularly when exposure to wildfire smoke occurred in late pregnancy. The association between wildfire exposure and small for gestational age (n = 2) and infant mortality (n = 1) was inconclusive. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that maternal exposure to wildfire during late pregnancy is linked to reduced birth weight and preterm birth.

Effects of environmental stressors, such as wildfires, on birth outcomes in primates, and in humans, are poorly understood. Additionally, wildfires are of growing concern due to their increasing frequency and severity. The objective was to examine the impact of wildfire smoke on fertility, timing of birth, and pregnancy loss for field monkeys. A unique case-control study to investigate birth outcomes in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) was conducted at the CNPRC. All females in the study were maintained in outdoor fields during a period of elevated ambient wildfire smoke from November 8–22, 2018. In addition to ambient air quality evaluations, the effects on fertility, timing to birth, and pregnancy loss were documented. Archival records of approximately 5,000 conceptions from the previous nine years served as control data. During the Camp Fire, ambient fine particulate (PM <inf>2.5</inf>) levels exceeded the 24 -h National Ambient Air Quality Standard (35 μg/m 3) of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, reaching levels as high as 185 μg/m 3. A statistically significant association was observed between birth loss and the 2018–2019 CNPRC breeding season. As this wildfire event occurred during various stages of early pregnancy, an association can be inferred between early gestational exposure and increased risk of pregnancy loss. © 2021 The Authors";"Air-quality; Climate; Miscarriage; Particulate; Phthalate; Primate; Smoke; Wildfire; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; camping; case control study; chemical composition; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental impact assessment; environmental stress; female; female fertility; first trimester pregnancy; high risk pregnancy; nonhuman; PM2.5 exposure; pregnancy outcome; prenatal exposure; rhesus monkey; wildfire; adverse event; air pollutant; animal; California; environmental exposure; fertility; pregnancy; smoke; veterinary medicine; Air Pollutants; Animals; Case-Control Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fertility; Macaca mulatta; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Smoke; Wildfires";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114191714&doi=10.1016%2Fj.reprotox.2021.08.005&partnerID=40&md5=16605e49a2e55ff22ade7cb7af40ce7d"

We compared self-reported adverse respiratory health outcomes in young adults born EP/ELBW with controls following smoke exposure from the 2019/2020 wildfires in the Australian state of Victoria, and explored if any effects were mediated by airway obstruction, reflected in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<inf>1</inf>). Methods: EP/ELBW participants were derived from all survivors born in the state of Victoria in 1991–92. Contemporaneous controls of normal birthweight (>2499 g) were recruited in the newborn period and matched for sociodemographic variables. Both groups had been assessed at intervals through childhood and into adulthood. Those who participated in the most recent follow-up assessment at 25 years of age, when FEV<inf>1</inf> had been measured, were sent a survey when they were approximately 28 years of age asking about respiratory health related outcomes (respiratory symptoms, health services usage, medication uptake) following wildfire smoke exposure over the southern hemisphere summer of 2019–20. Results: A total of 296 participants (166 EP/ELBW; 130 controls) were sent the survey; 44% of the EP/ELBW group and 47% of the control group responded. Compared with controls, EP/ELBW respondents reported more overall respiratory problems (30%vs 20%) and specific respiratory symptoms (breathlessness, wheezing, cough and chest tightness) following wildfire smoke exposure, as well as higher health services usage (e.g. local health clinic, hospital emergency department) and medication uptake for respiratory-related problems. Higher FEV<inf>1</inf> values were associated with lower odds of most self-reported respiratory symptoms; adjusting for FEV<inf>1</inf> attenuated the differences between EP/ELW and control groups. Conclusion: Survivors born EP/ELBW may be at an increased risk of adverse respiratory health outcomes following wildfire smoke exposure in early adulthood, in part related to worse expiratory airflows. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.";"Extremely low birthweight; Extremely preterm; Respiratory health; Wildfire smoke; Young adults; corticosteroid; lung surfactant; airflow; demographic trend; public health; respiratory disease; smoke; symptom; weight; wildfire; adult; adulthood; adverse outcome; age; airway obstruction; Article; birth weight; chest tightness; childhood; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; coughing; demography; disease association; drug use; dyspnea; emergency ward; environmental exposure; exploratory research; extremely low birth weight; female; follow up; forced expiratory volume; health care utilization; health center; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; personal experience; prematurity; priority journal; prospective study; respiratory function; respiratory tract disease; self report; socioeconomics; Southern Hemisphere; summer; survivor; Victoria; wheezing; wildfire smoke; young adult; adverse event; Australia; child; newborn; Victoria [Australia]; Adult; Birth Weight; Child; Female; Humans; Infant, Extremely Premature; Infant, Newborn; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Smoke; Wildfires; Young Adult";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104602407&doi=10.1016%2Fj.envres.2021.111159&partnerID=40&md5=af284007a261c2d10f045219fa315bd4"

Although some research has been conducted into the adverse health impacts of POs, significant gaps remain regarding whether POs would affect the health of pregnant women. We investigated the association between ED visits due to pregnancy complications and the occurence, intensity, and duration of large-scale POs in eight Sandy-affected counties in New York State (NYS). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, daily ED visits for pregnancy complications and large-scale PO data in eight counties in NYS from October to December in 2005–2014 were collected. Using time-series analysis, we estimated the relative increase in ED visits for pregnancy complications during POs compared with non-PO periods at lag 0–7 days. Short-term health impacts of PO intensity and PO duration were investigated. Estimations were also stratified by sociodemographic characteristics and disease subtypes including threatened or spontaneous abortion, threatened or early labor, hypertension complications, infections of genitourinary tract, renal diseases, gestational diabetes mellitus, mental illnesses, and cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy. Results: From October to December in 2005–2014, there were 307,739 ED visits for pregnancy complications in the eight counties. We found significant increases in ED visits for overall pregnancy complications (16.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.3%, 23.2%) during the Hurricane-PO period at lag 0–7 days. The ED visits increased by 8.8% per level increase in PO intensity and 1.4% per day increase in PO duration. Specifically, threatened/early delivery and gestational diabetes mellitus during the PO period increased by 26.7% (95% CI: 8.2%, 48.4%) and 111.8% (95% CI: 16.7%, 284.4%), respectively. Young adult, Black, Hispanic, and uninsured individuals were at higher risk of complications. Conclusions: POs may adversely impact pregnancy, especially for certain pregnancy complications and among low sociodemographic women. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.";"Hurricane; Natural disaster; Power outage; Pregnancy health; Climate change; Diseases; Hurricanes; Obstetrics; Time series analysis; Cardio-vascular disease; Confidence interval; Cross-sectional study; Gestational diabetes; New York State; Pregnant woman; Socio-demographic characteristics; Spontaneous abortion; Outages; abortion; climate change; hurricane; natural disaster; pregnancy; research work; symptom; womens health; adult; age; Article; Black person; cardiovascular disease; controlled study; cross-sectional study; emergency ward; female; high risk population; Hispanic; human; imminent abortion; kidney disease; major clinical study; maternal hypertension; medically uninsured; mental disease; New York; power outage; power supply; pregnancy complication; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; premature labor; priority journal; risk factor; spontaneous abortion; urinary tract infection; hospital emergency service; sand; young adult; New York [United States]; United States; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cyclonic Storms; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Sand; Young Adult";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100091761&doi=10.1016%2Fj.scitotenv.2021.145359&partnerID=40&md5=47d31a835041f8fca7a0ed1dde26590a"

Floods can increase stress which may negatively impact perinatal outcomes and mental health, but previous research is inconsistent. The objectives of this study are to examine the impact of the flood on pregnancy health, birth outcomes and postpartum mental health. Methods Linked administrative data from the province of Alberta were used. Outcomes included preterm birth, small for gestational age, a new diagnoses of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, and a diagnosis of, or drug prescription for, depression or anxiety. Data were analyzed using a quasi-experimental difference in difference design, comparing flooded and non-flooded areas and in affected and unaffected time periods. Multivariable log binomial regression models were used to estimate risk ratios, adjusted for maternal age. Marginal probabilities for the difference in difference term were used to show the potential effect of the flood. Results Participants included 18,266 nulliparous women for the pregnancy outcomes, and 26,956 women with infants for the mental health analysis. There were no effects for preterm birth (DID 0.00, CI: -0.02, 0.02), small for gestational age (DID 0.00, CI: -0.02, 0.02), or new cases of preeclampsia (DID 0.00, CI: -0.01, 0.01). There was a small increase in new cases of gestational hypertension (DID 0.02, CI: 0.01, 0.03) in flood affected areas. There were no differences in postpartum anxiety or depression prescriptions or diagnoses. Conclusion The Calgary 2013 flood was associated with a minor increase in gestational hypertension and not other health outcomes. Universal prenatal care and magnitude of the disaster may have minimized impacts of the flood on pregnant women. © 2021 Hetherington et al.

The study results indicate that negative rainfall shocks are robustly correlated with higher infant mortality and lower birth weight. In the long run, early life rainfall shortages limit an individual's income and housing conditions. The study findings indicate a significant interaction of rainfall shock with the severity of water scarcity. This result implies that drinking water safety is an essential channel through which early life rainfall shocks influence individual health endowments. However, agriculture production is not a likely channel for rainfall effects despite its association with infant mortality. Accordingly, our empirical results suggest that improving public facility coverage will reduce the vulnerability of infant health to adverse rainfall shocks in Guizhou and other developing areas. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.";"drought; infant health; infant mortality; rainfall shortage; water scarcity; weather; drinking water; rain; agriculture; Article; child health; China; controlled study; drought; female; housing; human; income; infant; infant mortality; low birth weight; male; priority journal; social status; water insecurity; weather; epidemiology; Agriculture; Droughts; Housing; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096692075&doi=10.1002%2Fhec.4191&partnerID=40&md5=ae6b4133adefbe70ec94928ef4b231e9"

Methods: Using 2017-2019 Florida vital statistics, we compared PNC use before and after Hurricane Michael. We categorized counties as most affected (Area A) or less affected (Area B and C). We examined whether Michael’s effects on perinatal outcomes varied by maternity care availability and used the Baron and Kenny method to assess whether delayed PNC initiation mediated perinatal outcomes. Log-binomial regression and semi-parametric linear regression were used, controlling for maternal and ZIP code tabulation area characteristics. Results: Compared to the one-year period pre-Michael, the week of the first PNC was later in all areas in the one-year period post-Michael, with the largest change in Area A (adjusted difference 0.112, 95% CI: 0.055-0.169), where women were less likely to receive PNC overall (aRR = 0.994, 95% CI = 0.990-0.998) and more likely to have inadequate PNC (aRR = 1.193, 95% CI = 1.127-1.264). Michael’s effects on perinatal outcomes did not vary significantly by maternity care availability within Area A. Delayed PNC initiation appeared to mediate an increased risk in small for gestational age (SGA) births after Michael. Conclusion: Women in Area A initiated PNC later and had a higher likelihood of inadequate PNC. Delayed PNC initiation may partially explain increased risk of SGA. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: We used the results of the Fukushima Health Management Survey which targeted women who gave birth from 2011–2012. Pregnant women were divided into three groups according to their residential area during the disaster (affected, middle, and less-affected area), and four groups according to pregnancy trimester during the disaster (first, second, third trimester, or conception after the disaster). Adjusted odds ratio (aORs) for HDP of each residential area was calculated using logistic regression models, with pregnancy trimester during the disaster as references. Results: Overall, 8323 women participated in the study (affected area: 2207; middle area: 5183; and less-affected area: 933). For women living in the affected and middle areas in the third trimester, the disaster was a significant risk factor for HDP (aOR: 2.61, 1.02–6.66, aOR: 1.93, 1.10–3.40, respectively). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate patient residential areas and gestational age during the time of a disaster to estimate the risk of HDP. The third trimester of pregnancy at the time of the disaster was associated with HDP for the women living in the affected and middle areas.

Methods: This study included employees of Tangshan Kailuan Mining Group between July 29, 1976 and April 28, 1977. The exposure group included subjects who experienced the Tangshan Earthquake during their prenatal period and who had lived in Tangshan since birth. The non-exposure group included subjects who were born 1–1.9 years after the earthquake and who had lived in Tangshan since birth. A questionnaire was designed that included sociodemographic information, conditions during pregnancy, and earthquake experience. Anthropometric measurements including height and weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference were made. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and lipid profiles were also determined. Results: Totally 947 subjects were included with 397 subjects in the exposed group and 550 subjects in the non-exposed group. The diabetes rate is significant different in these four groups(χ2 =8.045, P = 0.045). Moreover, 11.8, 7.5 and 8.0% of the subjects who were exposed to earthquake in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester of pregnancy had diabetes. 5.1% of the subjects had diabetes in non-exposure group. Our multivariate analysis showed that 1st trimester (OR 2.481, 95%CI 1.02, 6.034; P = 0.045) and loss of family members during earthquake (OR 2.452, 95%CI 1.293, 4.653; P = 0.006) were associated with significantly increased risk of diabetes. Conclusions: Exposure to earthquake during the first trimester of pregnancy and experience of family member loss in the earthquake significantly increased the subsequent risk of diabetes in the middle age (36–39 years of age).

We control for observed and unobserved differences between pregnant women in the area affected by the earthquake and other pregnant women by including mother fixed effects in all of our regression models. We extend the previous literature by comparing the impact of the initial unexpected earthquake to the impacts of thousands of aftershocks that occurred in the same region over the 18 months following the initial earthquake. We find that exposure to these earthquakes reduced gestational age, increased the likelihood of having a late birth, and negatively affected newborn health—with the largest effects for earthquakes that occurred in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy. Our estimates are similar when we focus on just the impact of the initial earthquake or, in contrast, on all earthquakes controlling for endogenous location decisions using an instrumental variables approach. This suggests that the previous estimates in the literature that use this approach are likely unbiased and that treatment effects are homogenous in the population.

To review the trends in pregnancy outcomes after Hurricane Katrina and assess effects of the disaster on research and public health related to pregnant women. Methods. We reexamined the 2004-2006 vital statistics data from Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, assessing what the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in the population would have been under varying risk scenarios. Results. We saw a reduction in number of births as well as in low birth weight and preterm birth. If the number of births had stayed constant and the relative higher risk in the “missing” births had been between 17% and 100%, the storm would have been associated with an increased risk instead of a decrease. Because the relative decline in births was larger in Black women, the higher risk in the “missing” births required to create a significant increase associated with the storm was generally not as great as for White women. Conclusions. Higher exposure to Katrina may have produced a reduction in births among high-risk women in the region rather than increasing adverse outcomes among those who did give birth. © 2020 American Public Health Association Inc..

We examined the associations of maternal exposure to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake years before conception with adverse birth outcomes. Methods: We included 73,493 women who delivered in 96 hospitals in 24 provinces and autonomous regions from the 2015/16 China Labor and Delivery Survey. We weighted the multivariable logistic models based on the combination of coarsened exact matching (CEM) weight and survey weight, and performed sex-stratified analysis to test whether associations of maternal earthquake exposure with adverse birth outcomes (Stillbirth, preterm birth [PTB], low birthweight [LBW], and small for gestational age [SGA]) varied by sex. Results: The bivariate models showed that the weighted incidence of each adverse birth outcome was higher in exposed group than unexposed group: stillbirth (2.00% vs. 1.33%), PTB (14.14% vs. 7.32%), LBW (10.82% vs. 5.76%), and SGA (11.32% vs. 9.52%). The multivariable models showed maternal earthquake exposure was only associated significantly with a higher risk of PTB in offspring among all births (adjusted risk ratio [aRR](95%CI):1.25(1.06-1.48), P = 0.010). The sex-stratified analysis showed the association was significant among male births (aRR (95%CI): 1.40(1.12-1.75),P = 0.002),but unsignificant among female births. The sensitivity analysis reported similar findings. Conclusions: The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake exposure has a long-term effect on PTB.

No study (to our knowledge) has investigated this pathway considering development of preschool anxiety symptoms. Using data from the Queensland Flood study (QF2011), our objective was to determine whether toddler HPA-axis functioning mediated the association between aspects of flood-related PNMS and child anxiety symptoms at 4-years, and whether relationships were moderated by the timing of the stressor in utero or by the child's sex. Methods: Women, pregnant during the 2011 Queensland floods (N = 230), were recruited soon afterwards and completed questionnaires regarding their objective hardship (e.g., loss of personal property), subjective distress (post-traumatic-like symptoms) and cognitive appraisal of the disaster. At 16 months, indexes of the child's diurnal cortisol rhythm (awakening response, total daily output, diurnal slope [N = 80]), and stress reactivity (N = 111), were obtained. At 4-years, N = 117 mothers reported on their own mood and their children's anxiety symptoms; of these, N = 80 also had valid child cortisol reactivity data, and N = 64 had diurnal cortisol rhythm data. Results: A greater cortisol awakening response at 16 months mediated the relationship between subjective PNMS and anxiety symptoms at 4-years. Greater toddler daily cortisol secretion predicted more anxiety symptoms, independent of PNMS. The laboratory stressor did not elicit a cortisol response. PNMS effects were not dependent upon child sex nor on gestational timing of flood exposure. Conclusions: Indexes of diurnal cortisol in toddlerhood may represent vulnerability for anxiety symptoms in preschoolers, both independent of, and following, exposure to disaster-related prenatal maternal subjective distress. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd";"Childhood anxiety; Cortisol awaking response; Disaster; Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis; Prenatal maternal stress; Stress reactivity; hydrocortisone; adrenal function; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; child; childhood; circadian rhythm; cognitive defect; controlled study; disaster; disease course; disease predisposition; distress syndrome; female; flooding; hormone response; human; hydrocortisone release; hypophysis function; hypothalamus function; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; major clinical study; male; maternal behavior; maternal stress; mental stress; mother child relation; posttraumatic stress disorder; prediction; pregnant woman; prenatal stress; priority journal; Queensland; questionnaire; regulatory mechanism; symptom; toddler; anxiety; child development; complication; etiology; hypophysis adrenal system; hypothalamus hypophysis system; metabolism; newborn; pathophysiology; physiology; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prenatal exposure; preschool child; psychology; saliva; socioeconomics; wakefulness; young adult; Adult; Anxiety; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Disasters; Female; Floods; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Infant, Newborn; Male; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Saliva; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Wakefulness; Young Adult";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085347872&doi=10.1016%2Fj.psyneuen.2020.104716&partnerID=40&md5=07037a0afb80ca3ad90fc53028a341fe"

Earthquakes can cause acute distress, but can also contribute to chronic stress through long-term disruptions to social, economic and domestic circumstances. The aims of this study were to examine the direct effect of earthquake experiences on the birthweight of infants of women who experienced the 2015 Nepal Earthquakes during pregnancy and whether mental health mediated this relationship. Methods: This is a prospective, population-based cohort study. Pregnant women in Bhaktapur District, Nepal who had experienced the 2015 earthquakes after conception were recruited. Baseline data were collected in structured individual interviews. Follow up was a short telephone interview two weeks after the baby's birth. Infant birthweight recorded on the hospital-issued birth certificate. The direct effect of earthquake experiences on birthweight and the indirect effect via antenatal common mental disorders (CMDs) were tested using Sobel tests simultaneously. Results: In total 497/498 women contributed baseline data and 469 (94.4%) women also provided the birth weight of their infants. In total 6% of infants had low birth weight (< 2.5 kg). The earthquake experiences did not have a significant direct effect on birthweight (p = 0.116). However, the effect of earthquake experiences had a significant indirect effect on infant birthweight via CMDs. When 15 covariates were controlled, women who had moderate to severe earthquake experiences had an increase of 1.58 scores of antenatal CMD symptoms that resulted in their babies being 20.50 g lighter than those who had low earthquake experiences (p = 0.026). Conclusions: The findings from this study indicate that the relationship is mediated by the mental health of women during pregnancy. Data demonstrate that the mental health of women who are pregnant should be prioritised in post-disaster management not only because of the burden experienced by women but also because of the risk for the growth and development of their babies. © 2020 The Author(s).";"Antenatal; Birthweight; Common mental disorders; Earthquake experiences; adult; Article; birth weight; cohort analysis; earthquake; female; follow up; human; mental disease; mental health; Nepal; population research; pregnancy; prenatal period; prospective study; structured interview; symptom; telephone interview; low birth weight; newborn; pregnant woman; psychology; young adult; Adult; Birth Weight; Cohort Studies; Earthquakes; Female; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Prospective Studies; Young Adult";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088351694&doi=10.1186%2Fs12884-020-03086-5&partnerID=40&md5=e217052afc707d62537f53c99a75dc0b"

Elevated counts of surgeries for cryptorchidism and congenital heart malformations were observed throughout Japan from 2012 onward. The thyroid cancer detection rate (2011 to 2016) was associated with the dose-rate at the municipality level in the Fukushima prefecture. Since the birth weight is a simple and objective indicator for gestational development and pregnancy outcome, the question arises whether the annual birth weight distribution was distorted in a dose-rate-dependent manner across Japan after Fukushima. Methods: The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare provides prefecture-specific annual counts for 26.158 million live births from 1995 to 2018, of which 2.366 million births (9.04%) with weights < 2500 g. Prefecture-specific spatiotemporal trends of the low birth weight proportions were analyzed. Logistic regression allowing for level-shifts from 2012 onward was employed to test whether those level-shifts were proportional to the prefecture-specific dose-rates derived from Cs-137 deposition in the 47 Japanese prefectures. Results: The overall trend of the low birth weight prevalence (LBWp) in Japan discloses a jump in 2012 with a jump odds ratio (OR) 1.020, 95%-confidence interval (1.003,1.037), p-value 0.0246. A logistic regression of LBWp on the additional dose-rate after the FDNPP accidents adjusted for prefecture-specific spatiotemporal base-line trends yields an OR per μSv/h of 1.098 (1.058, 1.139), p-value < 0.0001. Further adjusting the logistic regression for the annual population size and physician density of the prefectures, as well as for the counts of the dead, the missing, and the evacuees due to earthquake and tsunami (as surrogate measures for medical infrastructure and stress) yields an OR per μSv/h of 1.109 (1.032, 1.191), p-value 0.0046.

Data Sources: A literature search was conducted in four electronic databases: CINAHL Plus, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science. The following search terms were used: “cyclonic storms,” “cesarean section,” “premature birth,” “fetal mortality,” “low birth weight,” “infant mortality,” “pregnancy complications,” and “pregnancy outcome.” Study Selection: Documents were included if they were peer-reviewed, full-text articles or government documents published in English through February 2020 that focused on the associations among exposure to hurricanes and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. The initial search yielded 211 articles, and one article was identified through a hand search. After 48 duplicates were removed, we screened the titles and abstracts of 164 articles. We conducted a full-text review of 57 articles, and 19 articles were included in the integrative review. Data Extraction: We extracted data from the full text of each article into a standardized table with the following headings: author, year of publication, location, hurricane and year, population studied, study design, outcomes, data source, and results. Data Synthesis: We analyzed study findings based on the outcomes of pregnancy complications, preterm birth, cesarean birth, labor and birth complications, low birth weight, abnormal newborn conditions, and fetal mortality. We synthesized data in a narrative format, and the synthesis indicated that hurricane exposure was frequently associated with pregnancy complications, preterm birth, low birth weight, cesarean birth, and abnormal newborn conditions. However, these associations were not always consistent. Extant research is limited by inconsistency among study designs and the type of hurricane exposure. Conclusion: Interdisciplinary teams that include nurses, midwives, obstetricians and gynecologists, and other health care professionals should ensure that hurricane preparedness and response efforts specifically address the needs of pregnant women to mitigate adverse outcomes.; Hurricane exposure was associated with pregnancy complications, preterm birth, cesarean birth, labor and birth complications, and abnormal newborn conditions. © 2020 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses; © 2020 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses";"cesarean birth; cyclonic storm; fetal mortality; infant; infant mortality; low birth weight; pregnancy complications; pregnancy outcome; premature birth; Australia; female; human; hurricane; newborn; patient care; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; pregnancy outcome; United States; Vanuatu; Cyclonic Storms; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Patient Care Team; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Outcome";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087814581&doi=10.1016%2Fj.jogn.2020.04.006&partnerID=40&md5=353b8b75d2675b24a957ae0675a7f46d"

However, the impact of TCs on pregnant women, a vulnerable population, remains largely unknown. We aimed to estimate the association between prenatal exposure to TCs and risk of preterm birth in the eastern United States (US) and to assess whether the association varies by individual- and area-level characteristics. Methods: We included data on 19,529,748 spontaneous singleton births from 1989 to 2002 across 378 US counties. In each county, we classified days as exposed to a TC when TC-associated peak sustained winds at the county's population-weighted center were >17.2 m/s (gale-force winds or greater). We defined preterm birth as births delivered prior to 37 completed weeks of gestation. We used distributed lag log-linear mixed-effects models to estimate the relative risk (RR) and absolute risk difference (ARD) for TC exposure by comparing preterm births occurring in TC-periods (from 2 days before to 30 days after the TC's closest approach to the county's population center) to matched non-TC periods. We conducted secondary analyses using other wind thresholds (12 m/s and 22 m/s) and other exposure metrics: county distance to storm track (30 km, 60 km, and 100 km) and cumulative rainfall within the county (75 mm, 100 mm, and 125 mm). Results: During the study period, there were 1,981,797 (10.1%) preterm births and 58 TCs that affected at least one US county on which we had birth data. The risk of preterm birth was positively associated with TC exposure defined as peak sustained wind speed >17.2 m/s (gale-force winds or greater) [RR: 1.01 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.03); ARD: 9 (95% CI: −7, 25) per 10,000 pregnancies], distance to storm track <60 km [RR: 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.04); ARD: 23 (95% CI: 9, 38) per 10,000 pregnancies], and cumulative rainfall >100 mm [RR: 1.04 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.06); ARD: 36 (95% CI: 16, 56) per 10,000 pregnancies]. Results were comparable when considering other wind, distance, or rain thresholds. The association was more pronounced among early preterm births and mothers living in more socially vulnerable counties but did not vary across strata of other hypothesized risk factors. Conclusions: Maternal exposure to TC was associated with a higher risk of preterm birth. Our findings provide initial evidence that severe storms may trigger preterm birth. © 2020";"Birth cohort; Preterm birth; Tropical cyclone; United States; Hurricanes; Obstetrics; Population statistics; Rain; Risk perception; Storms; Tropics; Wind; Coastal population; Cumulative rainfall; Level characteristic; Linear mixed-effects model; Maternal exposure; Population centers; Prenatal exposure; Retrospective analysis; Risk assessment; rain; birth rate; environmental factor; health impact; maternal health; pregnancy; public health; risk assessment; tropical cyclone; vulnerability; womens status; adult; Article; clinical assessment; clinical feature; controlled study; disease association; educational status; environmental exposure; female; gestational age; high risk infant; human; hurricane; major clinical study; male; marriage; maternal age; maternal exposure; newborn; observational study; parity; population research; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; prenatal exposure; priority journal; race difference; retrospective study; risk factor; sex difference; storm (weather); United States; wind speed; mother; prematurity; wind; Cyclonic Storms; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Mothers; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Retrospective Studies";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085554618&doi=10.1016%2Fj.envint.2020.105825&partnerID=40&md5=9f7f1fd3243f110b5fd6af4868b432cd"

In this study, 40 pregnant Awassi ewes randomly allocated to free watering group (C, n = 20) received water ad libitum and the water restricted group (WR) received 50% less water than the amount provided to group C. Water restriction decreased (p <.05) lambs’ birth weights, placental weights (PWs), and cotyledon numbers (CNs). Placental efficiency (PE) and cotyledon efficiency (CE) were significantly higher in the WR group (p <.05). A marked difference in cotyledon weight – an increase of 12.1% – was recorded in the C group.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether infants of mothers with at least 1 positive ZIKV test show differences in cognitive scores at ages 3 to 6 months and ages 9 to 12 months. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study recruited infants enrolled in existing ZIKV study cohorts associated with the Maternal-Infant Studies Center and the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium at the University of Puerto Rico and from the broader San Juan metropolitan area. The study took place at the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium at the University of Puerto Rico. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling if their mothers underwent ZIKV testing prenatally and were at the target ages during the study period. Infants who were born preterm (<36 weeks’ gestational age), with low birth weight (<2500 g), or with a known genetic disorder were excluded. Infants were tested from ages 3 to 6 months or ages 9 to 12 months from May 2018 to April 2019. Data analysis was performed from March to April 2019. EXPOSURES Zika virus status was measured prenatally and in the early postnatal period using real-time polymerase chain reaction or a ZIKV IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The infants’ development was assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (translated to Spanish and adapted for Puerto Rico), and assessors were blinded to each infant’s ZIKV status. RESULTS A total of 65 study participants were included. The mean (SD) age of the infants at the time of cognitive testing was 8.98 (3.19) months. Most of the infants were white (55 [84.6%]) and Puerto Rican (64 [98.5%]); 38 of the infants were male (58.5%). General cognitive and domain-specific scores did not differ significantly between prenatally ZIKV-positive and ZIKV-negative infants except for receptive language score (mean difference = 5.52; t = 2.10; P = .04). Exposure to ZIKV (B = −5.69; β = −0.26 [95% CI −11.01 to −0.36]; P = .04) and a measure of Hurricane Maria exposure (time without water, B = −0.05; β = −0.27 [95% CI, −0.10 to −0.01]; P = .03) were both independently and significantly associated with receptive language scores after adjusting for key confounders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although infants exposed to ZIKV prenatally showed unaffected motor and visually mediated cognitive development, they did show deficits in receptive language scores. Receptive language skills were also associated with the degree of exposure to Hurricane Maria, with those who spent more time without water after the hurricane having lower receptive language scores. © 2019 Valdes V et al.";"child development; cross-sectional study; female; human; hurricane; infant; language development; male; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; Puerto Rico; virology; Zika fever; Child Development; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cyclonic Storms; Female; Humans; Infant; Language Development; Male; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Zika Virus Infection";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074112697&doi=10.1001%2Fjamanetworkopen.2019.14061&partnerID=40&md5=90f424ca8f92bb2e5a3904af163d2e03"

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of resident women with at least one singleton live birth between 1997 and 2013 in northwest Arkansas using state birth certificate data linked to data from the Arkansas Reproductive Health Monitoring System, a statewide birth defects registry. We calculated unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from modified Poisson regression analyses for non-Hispanic (NH) whites, NH-blacks, Hispanics and Marshallese, using NH-whites as the reference group. Results: Of the 91,662 singleton births during the study period, 2,488 were to Marshallese women. Due to the relatively small number of Marshallese births, we could not calculate prevalence estimates for some defects. Marshallese infants had higher rates of congenital cataracts (PR = 9.3; 95% CI: 3.1, 27.9). Although the number of defects was low, Marshallese infants also had higher rates of truncus arteriosus (PR = 44.0; 95% CI: 2.2, 896.1). Conclusions: Marshallese infants may have increased risk of specific birth defects, but estimates are unstable because of small sample size so results are inconclusive.

However, whether hurricane exposure is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications is less known. Objective: To assess the immediate impact and lasting impact of Hurricane Sandy (Sandy)on pregnancy complications. Methods: Using time-series study, we estimated the relative risks (RRs)of emergency department (ED)visits for pregnancy complications in eight affected counties in New York State, based on data of 2005–2014. The immediate impact was estimated by comparing the ED visits of pregnancy complications during the Sandy period to the non-Sandy periods. For the lasting impact of Sandy, we estimated the RRs by contrasting the ED visits in the following 12 months after Sandy with the same months of other years. Results: We found that ED visits for overall pregnancy complications increased 6.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.2%, 10.5%)during the Sandy month. ED visits increased for threatened abortion (9.9%, 95% CI: 4.4%, 15.7%), threatened labor (10.1%, 95% CI: 1.9%, 18.9%), early onset of delivery (115.9%, 95% CI: 6.9%, 336.3%), renal disease (73.2%, 95% CI: 0.3%, 199.4%), and diabetes (42.3%, 95% CI: 15.0%, 76.0%). Gestational hypertension and renal disease were elevated 7–8 months after Sandy. The ED visits of mental illness increased gradually after Sandy and peaked eight months later with visits increasing 33.2%. Conclusions: This study suggests that hurricanes may impact pregnancy health immediately and that some negative health may last for months thereafter. © 2019";"Disaster; Emergency department visit; Hurricane; Pregnancy complications; Disasters; Diseases; Emergency rooms; Obstetrics; Risk perception; Confidence interval; Emergency departments; Mental illness; New York State; Pregnancy complications; Relative risks; Renal disease; Hurricanes; assessment method; estimation method; Hurricane Sandy 2012; pregnancy; risk factor; time series analysis; Article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; emergency ward; female; human; hurricane; imminent abortion; kidney disease; major clinical study; maternal hypertension; mental disease; New York; obstetric delivery; pregnancy complication; priority journal; emergency health service; hospitalization; risk; statistics and numerical data; New York [United States]; United States; Cyclonic Storms; Emergency Medical Services; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; New York City; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Risk";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065425604&doi=10.1016%2Fj.scitotenv.2019.04.436&partnerID=40&md5=190c00aec5d054362ada37a866108191"

However, no studies in Japan have classified infant mortality trends into neonatal and postneonatal or considered regional issues. This study aimed to explore trends in neonatal and postneonatal deaths, both overall for Japan and in a region affected by a natural disaster. Methods: Drawing on national infant death data, we used a multi-attribute compositional study design to examine all infant deaths occurring in a region affected by a disaster (Tohoku, which consists of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima) between 2002 and 2012. We used conjoint analysis to clarify the associations between infant and maternal characteristics and age of infant death. Results: We obtained data of a total of 31,012 infant deaths between 2002 and 2012, which included 1450 from Tohoku. Infant mortality rates in Japan overall declined over the period but increased in 2011. There were more postneonatal (29-364 days post-birth) than neonatal (0-28 days post-birth) deaths. Infant deaths in Tohoku declined slightly overall, with a fluctuation in 2011. In Tohoku, the trends in postneonatal death rates were similar; the overall rates for males increased, but those for females decreased in 2011. We found that the cause and place of infant death differed by gender for neonatal and postneonatal deaths in both Japan in general and Tohoku. The conjoint analysis showed that most variables affected the age of postneonatal death. The factor with the largest influence on the variation in infant death age was gestational week (55.5%). A maternal gestational week ≤36 was linked to an average age at death of 43.4 days, and > 37 was linked to an average of 83.7 days. Conclusions: In Japan, infant death rates have declined steadily over the past 10 years. The recent trends indicated that postneonatal death rates were higher than neonatal rates, especially in Tohoku. However, not much attention has been focused on postneonatal deaths in Japan. Our findings may help health planners to prioritise work on the factors that are linked to infant deaths in the neonatal and postneonatal periods.

We examined the relationship between prenatal exposure to the spring 2011 tornado outbreak in Alabama and Joplin (Missouri) and adverse birth outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional cohort study using the 2010-2012 linked infant births and deaths data set from the National Center for Health Statistics for tornado-affected counties in Alabama (n=126,453) and Missouri (Joplin, n=6,897). Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate associations between prenatal exposure to tornadoes and birth outcomes. Results: Prenatal exposure to the tornado incidents did not influence birth weight outcomes. Women exposed to Alabama tornadoes were less likely to have a preterm birth compared to unexposed mothers (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.91, 0.96). Preterm births among Joplin-tornado exposed mothers were slightly higher (13%) compared with unexposed mothers (11.2%). Exposed mothers from Joplin were also more likely to have a cesarean section compared to their counterparts (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.26). Conclusions: We found no association between tornado exposure and adverse birth weight and infant mortality rates. Our findings suggest that prenatal exposure can amplify the odds for a cesarean section. © Copyright 2018 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.";"2011 Alabama and Joplin tornado outbreak; birth outcomes; emergency preparedness; natural disasters; prenatal exposure; adult; adverse event; Alabama; chi square distribution; cross-sectional study; environmental exposure; female; human; Missouri; newborn; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; prenatal injury; retrospective study; statistical model; tornado; Adult; Chi-Square Distribution; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Prenatal Injuries; Retrospective Studies; Tornadoes";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048815461&doi=10.1017%2Fdmp.2018.55&partnerID=40&md5=7858af82fa890bd4ca79e1eb131a14fa"

Design Retrospective cohort study. Choice of variables informed by literature and Delphi consensus. Setting Study conducted during the baseline phase of a community level intervention for pre-eclampsia that was led by community health workers. Participants A household census identified 50 493 households that were home to 80 483 women of reproductive age (age 12-49 years). Of these women, 14 617 had been pregnant in the 12 months prior to the census, of which 9172 (61.6%) had completed their pregnancies. Primary and secondary outcome measures A combined fetal, maternal and neonatal outcome was calculated for all women with completed pregnancies. Results A total of six variables were statistically significant (p≤0.05) in explaining the combined outcome. These included: Geographic isolation, flood proneness, access to an improved latrine, average age of reproductive age woman, family support and fertility rates. The performance of the ordinary least squares model was an adjusted R 2 =0.69. Three of the variables (isolation, latrine score and family support) showed significant geographic variability in their effect on rates of adverse outcome. Accounting for this modest non-stationary effect through geographically weighted regression increased the adjusted R 2 to 0.71. Conclusions The community exploration was successful in identifying context-specific determinants of maternal health. The results highlight the need for designing targeted interventions that address the place-specific social determinants of maternal health in the study area. The geographic process of identifying and measuring these determinants, therefore, has implications for multisectoral collaboration. © 2019 Author(s).";"geostatistics; global health; health geography; maternal health; spatial epidemiology; adolescent; adult; adverse outcome; Article; child; cohort analysis; Delphi study; descriptive research; feasibility study; female; fertility; flooding; human; Mozambique; outcome assessment; precipitation; preeclampsia; pregnancy outcome; retrospective study; semi structured interview; travel; unemployment; family; geography; health care delivery; least square analysis; live birth; maternal age; maternal mortality; newborn; parity; perinatal mortality; pregnancy; regression analysis; sanitation; social support; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; young adult; Abortion, Spontaneous; Adult; Cohort Studies; Family; Female; Floods; Geography; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Least-Squares Analysis; Live Birth; Maternal Age; Maternal Mortality; Parity; Perinatal Mortality; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Social Support; Stillbirth; Toilet Facilities; Young Adult";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061123366&doi=10.1136%2Fbmjopen-2018-024042&partnerID=40&md5=2b248eb6064922033f838b7844322edd"

Considerable evidence has accumulated demonstrating the adverse effects of natural disasters on pregnancy outcomes and developmental trajectories. However, beyond tracking outcomes, the time has arrived for gathering more information related to identifying mechanisms, predicting risk and developing stress-reducing and resilience-building interventions to improve outcomes. Further, we need to learn how to encapsulate both the quantitative and qualitative information available and share it with communities and authorities to mitigate the adverse developmental effects of future disasters, conflicts and migrations.

Earthquakes have been associated with increased risks of preterm birth (PTB) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, the literature on this subject is scarce. Maternal antenatal stress has been suggested as the link between earthquakes and PTB. In this study the Christchurch earthquake was utilised as a model of maternal stress to assess its effects on PTB rates and other pregnancy outcomes. Aim: To investigate whether women who experienced a major earthquake during the first trimester of pregnancy were at an altered risk of PTB compared to women who did not experience an earthquake during their pregnancy. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. Women carrying a singleton pregnancy in their first trimester on 22 February, 2011 were identified for a post-earthquake cohort (n = 1057). A group of women pregnant in 2009 were identified for a pre-earthquake cohort (n = 1314). Data were obtained from electronic medical records and the hospital clinical coding database. Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to analyse differences in pregnancy outcomes. Statistically significant variables together with earthquake exposure were assessed as risk factors for PTB using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: No significant difference in the rate of PTB was found between the two groups P > 0.05). Conclusion: Women carrying a singleton pregnancy in this study who experienced a major earthquake in their first trimester do not seem to be at an increased risk of PTB. © 2018 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists";"earthquake; first trimester; pregnancy; preterm birth; stress; adult; Article; attributable risk; birth rate; cesarean section; cohort analysis; controlled study; earthquake; elective surgery; emergency surgery; female; first trimester pregnancy; gestational age; human; low birth weight; major clinical study; male; maternal smoking; maternal stress; neonatal intensive care unit; New Zealand; newborn; observational study; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnancy outcome; pregnancy toxemia; premature labor; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; vaginal delivery; pregnancy; prematurity; prenatal care; Adult; Cohort Studies; Earthquakes; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Premature Birth; Prenatal Care; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043304368&doi=10.1111%2Fajo.12797&partnerID=40&md5=ffe514668b7db6e0985761fb0a93dba8"

There is emerging evidence that experiencing a natural disaster might increase the risk of antenatal CMDs. This study aimed to synthesise the evidence about the prevalence and determinants of clinically-significant symptoms of antenatal CMDs among women who had recently experienced an earthquake. Methods: This systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The search included both electronic and manual components. Five major databases were searched. A data extraction table was used to summarise study characteristics and findings. Two authors examined the quality of studies independently using a quality assessment tool. A narrative synthesis of the findings reported. Results: In total seven articles met inclusion criteria. Quality scores ranged from six to seven out of ten. All the studies were cross-sectional surveys and were conducted in high and middle-income countries. Sample sizes varied among studies. The prevalence of clinically-significant symptoms of antenatal CMD ranged from 4.6% (95% CI, 3.2; 6.5) experiencing 'psychological stress' in Japan to 40.8% (95% CI, 35.5; 46.4) 'depression' in China. While all studies were conducted in an earthquake context, only four examined some aspect of earthquake experiences as a risk factor for antenatal CMDs. In multivariable analyses, higher marital conflict, poor social support, multiparity, stresses of pregnancy and the personality characteristic of a negative coping style were identified as risks and a positive coping style as protective against antenatal CMDs. Conclusions: This systematic review found that women who have recently experienced an earthquake are at heightened risk of antenatal mental health problems. It indicates that in addition to the establishment of services for safe birth which is recognised in post-disaster management strategies, pregnancy mental health should be a priority. The review also revealed that there is no evidence available from the world's low-income nations where natural disasters might have more profound impacts because local infrastructure is more fragile and where it is already established that women experience a higher burden of antenatal CMDs.

This systematic review aims to synthesise the existing literature exploring the relationship between maternal exposure to short-to medium-term changes in outdoor air quality and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed articles using PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, ProQuest, GreenFILE and Scopus was conducted in January 2018 using selected search terms. Quality of included studies were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Results: Eleven studies were included; eight assessed the impact of maternal exposure to air pollution exacerbation events, such as wildfires, oil well fires and volcanic eruptions, and three assessed the impact of improvement events, such as the 2018 Beijing Olympics and closure of industrial activities, on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Studies were highly heterogenous in methodology. Six studies found a significant association between acute changes in air quality and markers of fetal growth restriction, while two did not. Three studies found an adverse association between acute changes in air quality and markers of gestational maturity, and one did not. Conclusion: Overall, there is some evidence that maternal exposure to acute changes in air quality of short-to medium-term duration increases the risk of fetal growth restriction and preterm birth. The relationship for other adverse obstetric or neonatal outcomes is less clear. Exposure of pregnant women to abrupt changes in air quality is linked to fetal growth restriction and possibly preterm birth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"Air pollution; Fetal growth restriction; Maternal exposure; Pregnancy; Premature birth; air pollution; air quality; birth weight; human; intrauterine growth retardation; maternal exposure; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; peer review; pregnancy outcome; Review; survival; systematic review; volcano; wildfire";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057110675&doi=10.1016%2Fj.envpol.2018.10.086&partnerID=40&md5=a2b980439eb64e68ce123b9c5e21e630"

During humanitarian events, the reproduction of maternal mortality figures by the media is common, and are often based on inaccurate reports. In light of such uncertainties and challenges, the aim of this article was to review and appraise the methodology and data collection tools used to measure MMR in humanitarian settings. A critical review of both grey and peer-review publications was conducted, focussing on articles published from January 1995 until December 2016. In the final review, articles that provided an estimate of MMR from a humanitarian setting were included. The assessment of study quality was based on an adapted framework for the quality of mortality studies in humanitarian settings. Overall, 13 peer-review publications and one grey publication were included in the final review. These were grouped according to settings: camp, clinic, household and census. Studies varied in their definition of MMR, and few studies objectively defined the humanitarian setting. Household-based studies were based on retrospective designs and on the recall of surviving family members. Although many studies attempted to purposively sample the populations afflicted, there was substantial evidence of selection bias; few studies were able to confirm the maternal deaths through medical certificates, or attempted to visit homes to re-inquire about deaths using verbal autopsy. The variation in methods and tools applied suggest that maternal mortality estimates are more likely to be markedly different from the true unknown level. The implications are that a standardized methodology and tools are necessary: That are consistent in definition, use a representative sample where possible, attempt to triangulate and validate data sources, and reconfirm deaths through household visits with informant interviews. © The Author 2018.

Design A population-based ecological study using publicly available data. Setting Twenty secondary medical areas (SMAs) in the disaster-affected zones in the north-eastern prefectures of Japan (Iwate, Fukushima and Miyagi). Participants: Children younger than 10 years who died in the 20 SMAs between 2008 and 2014 (n=1 748). Primary and secondary outcome measures: Multiple regression analysis for infant and child mortality rate. The mean values were applied for infant and child mortality rates and other factors before GEJET (2008-2010) and after GEJET (2012-2014). Results Between 2008 and 2014, the most common cause of death among children younger than 10 years was accidents. The mortality rate per 100 000 persons was 39.1±41.2 before 2011, 226.7±43.4 in 2011 and 31.4±39.1 after 2011. Regression analysis revealed that the mortality rate was positively associated with low age in each period, while the coastal zone was negatively associated with fewer disaster base hospitals in 2011. By contrast, the number of obstetrics and gynaecology centres (β=-189.9, p=0.02) and public health nurses (β=-1.7, p=0.01) was negatively associated with mortality rate per person in 2011. Conclusions In 2011, the mortality rate among children younger than 10 years was 6.4 times higher than that before and after 2011.

Specifically, I exploit the geographic intensity of extreme floods in Ecuador during the 1997–1998 El Niño phenomenon, which provides exogenous variation in exposure at different periods of early development. I show that children exposed to severe floods in utero, especially during the third trimester, are shorter in stature five and seven years later. Also, children affected by the floods in the first trimester of pregnancy score lower on cognitive tests. Additionally, I explore potential mechanisms by studying health at birth and family inputs (income, consumption, and breastfeeding). I find that children exposed to El Niño floods, especially during the third trimester in utero, were more likely to be born with low birth weight. Furthermore, households affected by El Niño suffered a decline in income, total consumption, and food consumption in the aftermath of the shock. Falsification exercises and robustness checks suggest that selection concerns such as selective fertility, mobility, and infant mortality do not drive these results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.";"Early-life shocks; Family inputs; Health at birth; Human capital formation; child health; El Nino; flooding; health geography; human capital; pregnancy; Article; breast feeding; child development; cognition; consumer attitude; early life stress; Ecuador; exercise; exposure; fertility; food intake; household income; human; human capital formation; infant mortality; low birth weight; lowest income group; mental stress; psychotrauma; social aspects and related phenomena; third trimester pregnancy; time; adult; adverse event; child; disaster; economics; epidemiology; female; infant; newborn; poverty; pregnancy outcome; prenatal exposure; preschool child; socioeconomics; young adult; Adult; Child; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Disasters; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Female; Floods; Humans; Infant; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054016330&doi=10.1016%2Fj.jhealeco.2018.07.003&partnerID=40&md5=b8787bc488f737f1e3f619f272a4b13a"

Soon after the JECS started, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred on March 11, 2011, with subsequent nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, causing catastrophic damage in Fukushima Prefecture. After the disaster, JECS was relaunched to cover all areas in Fukushima Prefecture due to public concern. In this study, we used the results of individuals enrolled in JECS, who gave birth during 2011-2014 in Fukushima Prefecture, to elucidate pregnancy outcomes in Fukushima Prefecture. The study consisted of 12,804 maternal outcomes. We thus found that the prevalence rates of preterm birth < 37 weeks, low birth weight (LBW) < 2,500 g, and LBW < 1,500 g were 5.6%, 9.5%, and 0.8%, respectively; these rates are in accordance with the National Vital Statistics of 2014.

In contrast to some cooperative breeders, subordinate female meerkats are physiologically able to reproduce and occasionally do so successfully; their attempts are more frequently ‘suppressed’ via eviction or infanticide by the dominant female. Spontaneous abortion and neonatal loss occur with some regularity, further negatively impacting reproductive success. Here, we compared the reproductive outcomes and endocrine profiles, including of serum progesterone (P <inf>4</inf> ), serum estradiol (E <inf>2</inf> ), and fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCm), of dominant and subordinate dams residing within their clans in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa. Our study spanned years of drought, which reduced insect abundance and represented a substantial environmental stressor. Meerkat pregnancies were identified at mid-term and culminated either in spontaneous abortions or full-term deliveries, after which pups were either lost prior to emergence from the natal den (usually within 2 days of birth) or emerged at 2–3 weeks. Neonatal loss exceeded fetal loss for all females, and contributed to narrowing the status-related disparity in female reproductive output seen during less arid periods. Although E <inf>2</inf> concentrations were significantly lower in subordinate than dominant females, they were sufficient to support gestation. Absolute E <inf>2</inf> concentrations may owe to androgenic precursors that also attain highest concentrations in dominant dams and may mediate aggression underlying female reproductive skew. Pregnancies terminating in fetal loss were marked by significantly lower P <inf>4</inf> concentrations in mid-gestation and modestly lower E <inf>2</inf> concentrations overall. Consistently high fGCm concentrations further increased across trimesters, particularly (but not consistently) in subordinates and in aborted pregnancies. Environmental stressors may modulate reproductive outcomes in meerkats through their influence on sex steroids and their effects on intragroup competition. The social and eco-physiological factors affecting intraspecific variation in reproductive output, even in obligate cooperative breeders, may be most apparent during extreme conditions, reflecting the benefits of long-term studies for assessing the impact of climate change. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.";"Climate change; Cooperative breeding; Fetal and neonatal mortality; Reproductive and stress hormones; Reproductive success; Social dominance; biological marker; estradiol; glucocorticoid; progesterone; Article; conception; cooperative breeding; environmental stress; estradiol blood level; fetus wastage; incidence; meerkats; mongoose; nonhuman; pregnancy; priority journal; progesterone blood level; reproduction; reproductive success; reproductive suppression; social stress; spontaneous abortion; animal; blood; chemistry; climate change; desert climate; drought; feces; female; metabolism; physiological stress; physiology; sexual behavior; social dominance; South Africa; veterinary abortion; Abortion, Veterinary; Animals; Climate Change; Desert Climate; Droughts; Estradiol; Feces; Female; Glucocorticoids; Herpestidae; Incidence; Pregnancy; Progesterone; Reproduction; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Social Dominance; Stress, Physiological";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048747235&doi=10.1016%2Fj.physbeh.2017.11.011&partnerID=40&md5=106a939cbcb63ebd442ea64e48e5ef14"

Cryptorchidism cannot be diagnosed before birth and is not a factor that would influence a woman's decision to seek an abortion. Therefore, this disease is considered suitable for assessing how the Great East Japan Earthquake and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident (2011) influenced congenital diseases. Materials and Methods: We obtained cryptorchidism discharge data collected over 6 years from hospitals that were included in an impact assessment survey of the Diagnosis Procedure Combination survey database in Japan and used these data to estimate the discharge rate after cryptorchidism surgery before and after the disaster. The 94 hospitals in Japan that participated in Diagnosis Procedure Combination system and had 10 or more discharges after cryptorchidism surgery within successive 6 years covering pre- and postdisaster period (FY2010-FY2015) were involved. The change in discharge rate between pre- and postdisaster was analyzed using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model. Results: Nationwide, a 13.4% (95% credible interval 4.7%-23.0%) increase in discharge rates was estimated. The results of all sensitivity analyses were similar to the reported main results. Conclusion: The discharge rate of cryptorchidism was increased nationwide. The rates of low-weight babies or preterm births, risk factors of cryptorchidism, were almost constant during the study period, and age distribution of the surgery was also not changed, which suggested that the other factors that associated with the disaster increased the incidence of cryptorchidism. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.";"Article; Bayes theorem; cryptorchism; disaster; Fukushima nuclear accident; health impact assessment; health survey; hospital discharge; human; incidence; Japan; male; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; adult; earthquake; female; low birth weight; mental stress; newborn; pathophysiology; physiology; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prematurity; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Cryptorchidism; Disasters; Earthquakes; Female; Fukushima Nuclear Accident; Humans; Incidence; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Male; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Premature Birth; Risk Factors; Stress, Psychological";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047653426&doi=10.1016%2Fj.urology.2018.04.033&partnerID=40&md5=85d7c2972c011192cd0e2494722c8e3c"

This study examines whether midwifery group practice (MGP) care during pregnancy affects infant neurodevelopment at 6-months of age compared to women receiving standard hospital maternity care (SC) in the context of a natural disaster. Methods: This prospective cohort study included 115 women who were affected by a sudden-onset flood during pregnancy. They received one of two models of maternity care: MGP or SC. The women's flood-related objective stress, subjective reactions, and cognitive appraisal of the disaster were assessed at recruitment into the study. At 6-months postpartum they completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3) on their infants' communication, fine and gross motor, problem solving, and personal-social skills. Results: Greater maternal objective and subjective stress predicted worse infant outcomes. Even when controlling for maternal stress from the flood, infants of mothers who were in the MGP model of maternity care performed better than infants of mothers in SC on two of the five ASQ-3 domains (fine motor and problem solving) at 6-months of age. Furthermore, infants in the SC model were more likely to be identified as at risk for delayed development on these domains than infants in the MGP model of care. Conclusions: Continuity of midwifery care has positive effects on infant neurodevelopment when mothers experience disaster-related stress in pregnancy, with significantly better outcomes on two developmental domains at 6months compared to infants whose mothers received standard hospital care. © 2018 The Author(s).";"Infant development; Midwifery group practice; Prenatal maternal stress; article; child development; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; hospital care; human; human experiment; infant; major clinical study; maternal care; maternal stress; midwife; natural disaster; nervous system development; outcome assessment; pregnancy; problem solving; prospective study; questionnaire; social competence; adult; flooding; hospital; mental disease; mental stress; nonbiological model; patient care; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; prevention and control; procedures; psychology; randomized controlled trial; therapy; Adult; Child Development; Continuity of Patient Care; Female; Floods; Hospitals, Maternity; Humans; Infant; Midwifery; Models, Organizational; Natural Disasters; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Patient Care Management; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Stress, Psychological";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050585848&doi=10.1186%2Fs12884-018-1944-5&partnerID=40&md5=c0bc0f06a9f18c1c4ec061649d7d2c17"

The impact of flooding on health varies among populations and depends primarily on vulnerability and the kind of event experienced. It severely disrupts livelihoods and has a significant impact on the health of pregnant women and children. In addition, it may exacerbate a range of negative psychological and physiological child and reproductive health outcomes. Awareness-raising, education, and the issuing of warnings appear to be key initiatives to mitigate or prevent flood morbidity and mortality, especially among people living in low- and middle-income countries.

Exposure to natural disasters during pregnancy provides a model to study these relationships. However, few studies assess both stress and diet, which might have interactive effects. Furthermore, most are conducted in high-income countries. Patterns might differ in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Aim: To study relationships between stress and diet during pregnancy, and infant birthweight, following a natural disaster in a lower-middle income country. Subjects and methods: In 2015, the island nation of Vanuatu suffered a Category 5 cyclone. Three months later, the authors assessed hardship due to the cyclone, distress, and dietary diversity among 900 women, including 187 pregnant women. Of these, 70 had birth records available. Multivariate linear regression was used to analyse relationships between cyclone exposure and infant birthweight among this sub-sample. Results: Neither hardship nor dietary diversity predicted birthweight. Distress was a robust predictor, explaining 8.5% of variance (p = 0.012). There were no interactive relationships between distress and other exposure variables. Conclusions: Maternal distress following a natural disaster has important implications for maternal and child health. In LMICs, low birthweight remains a pressing public health concern.

We recruited women from eastern Iowa who were pregnant in 2008 when disastrous floods occurred. Self-report measures of PNMS and cognitive appraisal of the flood’s consequences were obtained shortly after the disaster. Social support was assessed during pregnancy.

High social support (satisfaction or number) buffered the effect of PNMS or a negative appraisal of the flood on birthweight. The combination of high PNMS or a negative appraisal of the flood’s consequences and low social support resulted in higher offspring birthweight, which predicted greater BMI at 30 months.

The aim was to describe the indicative prevalence of and risk and protective factors for clinically-significant symptoms of antenatal common mental disorders (CMDs) among women who experienced the 2015 Nepal earthquakes during pregnancy. Methods A population-based cross-sectional study in Bhaktapur, one of 14 districts highly affected by the 2015 Nepal earthquakes. The primary outcome, clinically significant symptoms of CMDs, was ascertained using the Nepali validation of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS-N). In order to investigate potential trauma reactions, a subset of EPDS items as indicators of trauma symptoms was constructed. Standardised instruments and study-specific questions were used to measure potential risk and protective factors. Data were collected in individual structured interviews by trained health researchers. Hierarchical multiple linear regression models were used to establish risk and protective factors for clinically significant symptoms of CMDs and indicators of post-earthquake trauma reaction. Results Overall, 497/498 eligible pregnant women provided complete data. We found that 21.9% (95% CI, 18.4; 25.8) of participants had EPDS-N scores > 12 and another 17.1% (95% CI 13.9; 20.7) scored 10–12 indicating a high prevalence of clinically significant CMD symptoms. In total, 20 factors were included in the final hierarchical multiple linear regression model and together explained 33.3% of the variance in EPDS total scores; seven factors, including earthquake experiences and lifetime experience of intimate partner violence, increased risk and five including having income-generating work and a kind, and encouraging partner were protective. The association between earthquake experiences and the indicators of trauma symptoms was not significant in the hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis. Limitations The EPDS has not yet been formally validated in Nepal for use during pregnancy. Data were collected 6 months post-earthquake, so we were not able to capture the experiences of women who had spontaneous or induced abortions or premature births in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake. Conclusions In addition to the restoration of antenatal and obstetric services, the mental health of women who are pregnant requires specific consideration and interventions after natural disasters. This should take into account the additional adverse impact of violence perpetrated by an intimate partner. © 2017";"Antenatal; Common Mental Disorders; Earthquake; Intimate Partner Violence; adult; Article; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; earthquake; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; female; human; income; major clinical study; mental disease; Nepal; partner violence; personal experience; population research; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; prevalence; priority journal; disaster; mental health; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; psychological rating scale; psychology; sexuality; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disasters; Earthquakes; Female; Humans; Intimate Partner Violence; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnant Women; Prevalence; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Sexual Partners; Young Adult";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038888069&doi=10.1016%2Fj.jad.2017.12.016&partnerID=40&md5=74e7d0c76726e55c3afc371ca4f05372"

Objective To evaluate the effect of earthquake occurred on February 27, 2010 and perinatal outcomes of Chilean pregnant women, and to examine these effects by timing of exposure during pregnancy and newborn gender. Methods A register-based study was performed using data collected from women who had a vaginal delivery in a large private health center in Santiago, Chile, during 2009 and 2010. The study population was categorized according to exposure to earthquake and timing during gestation. Primary perinatal outcomes were gestational age at birth, birth weight, length and head circumference. Analyses adjusted for gender, gestational age at exposure, parity, maternal age and income. Results A total of 1,966 eligible vaginal deliveries occurred during 2009 and 2,110 in 2010. Birth weight was not affected by the trimester of exposure; however, length, head circumference and gestational age at birth were significantly different according to trimester of exposure and gender of newborn. In multivariable analysis, newborns were shorter by 2 mm, 5 mm and 4.5 mm, if they were exposed during their first, second and third trimester, respectively. Furthermore, newborns had a smaller head circumference by 1.2 mm and 1.5 mm if they were exposed during first and second trimester of gestation. Conclusion In this cohort, exposure to the February 2010 earthquake resulted in earlier delivery and reduced length and head circumference in the offspring. This association varied according to trimester of exposure and fetal gender.

Children’s (n = 30) C-peptide secretion in response to an oral glucose tolerance test were assessed in blood at 13½ years. DNA methylation levels of selected type 1 and 2 diabetes-related genes were chosen based upon the genes associated with prenatal maternal objective hardship and/or cognitive appraisal levels. Bootstrapping analyses were performed to determine the mediation effect of DNA methylation. We found that children whose mothers experienced higher objective hardship exhibited higher C-peptide secretion. Cognitive appraisal was not directly associated with C-peptide secretion. DNA methylation of diabetes-related genes had a positive mediation effect of objective hardship on C-peptide secretion: higher objective hardship predicted higher C-peptide secretion through DNA methylation. Negative mediation effects of cognitive appraisal were observed: negative cognitive appraisal predicted higher C-peptide secretion through DNA methylation. However, only one gene, LTA, remained a significant mediator of cognitive appraisal on C-peptide secretion after the conservative Bonferroni multiple corrections. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation could act as an intervening variable between prenatal stress and metabolic outcomes, highlighting the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in response to environmental factors. © 2018 Cao-Lei et al.

Methods: 1524 women aged 18–45 recruited through prenatal and Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) clinics, and community events were interviewed about their experience of the oil spill and reproductive history. 1434 women had information on outcomes of at least one pregnancy, and 633 on a pregnancy both before and after the spill. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the relationship between contact with oil and economic and social consequences of the spill with postponement of pregnancy, miscarriage, and infertility (time to pregnancy >12 months or reported fertility issues), with adjustment for age, race, BMI, smoking, and socioeconomic status. Results were compared for pregnancies occurring prior to and after the oil spill. Results: 77 (5.1%) women reported postponing pregnancy due to the oil spill, which was more common in those with high contact with oil or overall high exposure (aOR 2.92, 95% CI 1.31–6.51). An increased risk of miscarriage was found with any exposure to the oil spill (aOR, 1.54, 95% CI 1.17–2.02). Fertility issues were more common in the overall most highly exposed women (aOR 1.88, 1.19–2.95), when the data were limited to those with pregnancies before and after. However, no particular aspect of oil spill exposure was strongly associated with the outcomes, and effects were almost as strong for pregnancies prior to the oil spill.

Possible effects of lower doses are, however, controversial. We use carefully collected exposure data for Norway following the Chernobyl accident in April 1986 combined with population-based registries to assess long-term effects of fetal exposure on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Radiation doses were estimated for each Norwegian municipality for each calendar month from May 1986 to April 1989. We established a cohort of all Norwegian pregnancies during the three-year period of radiation measurement and compared them with appropriate unexposed groups. All cohorts were followed into adulthood. Risks of cerebral palsy, mental retardation, schizophrenia, epilepsy, vision or hearing problems, school dropout, and low income were estimated. We also conducted an analysis of mathematics and language grades using siblings born after the exposure period as comparison. There was little evidence of associations between radiation exposure and cerebral palsy, mental retardation, schizophrenia, epilepsy, or hearing or vision problems associated with radiation exposure. (p-values for trend with exposure dose were 0.27, 0.14, 0.83, 0.35 and 0.42.) Slightly more of the exposed failed to complete high school (p = 0.05), but there was no increase in the proportion with low income (p = 0.38). The natural advantage of older siblings over younger siblings in mathematics grades was diminished with exposure of older siblings (p = 0.003), but there was no association of exposure with Norwegian language grades (p = 0.37). There is scant evidence that the low-dose fallout from Chernobyl in Norway increased the risk for serious neurodevelopmental problems. We cannot exclude the possibility of lower mathematics grades with exposure, similar to a report from Sweden. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.";"Chernobyl; Developmental; Long-term follow-up; Neurological; Pregnancy; Prenatal; Radiation; Article; cerebral palsy; Chernobyl accident; developmental outcome; epilepsy; fallout; follow up; hearing disorder; human; language; low energy radiation; lowest income group; mathematics; mental deficiency; neurological outcome; Norway; outcome assessment; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; radiation dose; radiation exposure; radiation measurement; register; risk; schizophrenia; school dropout; visual disorder; adolescent; cohort analysis; developmental disorder; female; newborn; newborn disease; pregnancy outcome; radiation response; Adolescent; Chernobyl Nuclear Accident; Cohort Studies; Developmental Disabilities; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Newborn, Diseases; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Radiation Dosage";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045242086&doi=10.1007%2Fs10654-017-0350-z&partnerID=40&md5=c8cf9c49dabd9d005fc6cd45531d1f94"

Generalized estimating equations (logistic regression) with adjustment for confounders were used. To assess possible unmeasured confounding, instead of considering oil spill exposure as a time-varying exposure, women were defined as oil spill-exposed or not. If oil spill-exposed women were equally prone to complications in pregnancies that occurred prior to the oil spill as after it, it was considered that any associations were likely due to selection or reporting issues. Women who reported oil spill exposure, particularly loss of use of the coast, were more likely to report gestational diabetes; however, the level of association was similar for pregnancies before and after the spill (p for interaction >0.10 and odds ratios (ORs) for pregnancies prior to the spill > than those after the spill). No associations were found between oil spill exposure and hypertensive disorders.

Maternal stress might also induce behavioural changes, such as dietary change, that might influence fetal development. Few studies have documented relationships between stress and dietary change in pregnancy. We analysed stress and dietary change among 222 pregnant women exposed to the 2011 Queensland Floods. We assessed women's objective hardship, subjective distress and cognitive appraisal of the disaster; changes in their diets and their associations with infants' gestational age, weight, length and head circumference at birth, head circumference to birth length ratio (HC/BL) and ponderal index. Greater objective hardship was correlated with more negative dietary change, skipped meals and skipped multivitamins. There were no direct effects of stress or dietary change on birth outcomes. However, we observed an interactive effect of dietary change and exposure timing on head circumference for gestational age (HC for GA) (p = 0.010) and a similar trend for HC/BL (p = 0.064). HC for GA and HC/BL were larger among children whose mothers experienced negative changes to their diet in early pregnancy compared with later pregnancy, consistent with a ‘head-sparing’ response with early gestation exposure. Further analyses indicated that dietary change mediates the relationship between objective hardship because of the floods and these outcomes. This is the first report of relationships among an independent stressor, dietary change and birth outcomes. It highlights another possible mechanism in the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and child development that could guide future research and interventions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd";"Barker hypothesis; behaviour; birth outcomes; infant growth; pregnancy; women's health; multivitamin; adult; anthropometric parameters; Article; behavior change; body height; body weight; childbirth; cognition; controlled study; disaster; distress syndrome; feeding behavior; female; first trimester pregnancy; flooding; gestational age; head circumference; head circumference to birth length ratio; human; infant; major clinical study; male; maternal behavior; maternal stress; ponderal index; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; prenatal stress; priority journal; Queensland; third trimester pregnancy; adolescent; child development; diet; epidemiology; fetus development; meal; mental stress; pregnancy; prenatal care; prenatal exposure; questionnaire; retrospective study; socioeconomics; Adolescent; Child Development; Diet; Disasters; Female; Fetal Development; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant; Male; Meals; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Prenatal Care; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Retrospective Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84997142614&doi=10.1111%2Fmcn.12359&partnerID=40&md5=51cf954ee4c460ff555c76b3692972de"

Maternal and perinatal data were retrospectively collected for all live singleton births at a public hospital, located 23 km from the power plant, from 2008 to 2015. Proportions of low birthweight (<2500 g at birth) and preterm births (<37 weeks gestation at birth) were compared pre- and post-disaster, and regression models were conducted to assess for associations between these outcomes and evacuation and food avoidance.

Participants included 86 women who were pregnant during or after the earthquake in Ningqiang county, and their children. Data were collected from February to March of 2012. PTSD questionnaire (PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version (PCL-C)) was used to measure the effect of the earthquake on mothers, and that the scores greater than 50 were used to indicate presence of PTSD. Each child was assessed using the mental Developmental Screening Test (DST) according to age. Among the 86 women, PTSD scores equal to or greater than 50 accounted for 20.93%. Among the 86 children, 25.60%of development quotient (DQ) scores and 19.80%of mental index (MI) scores were less than 85. The correlation coefficient analysis showed that PTSD scores were inversely related to DQ and MI scores. Maternal PTSD following earthquake exposure is associated with relatively lower intellectual development in children age 0-3 years.

The region is relatively poor in terms of GDP and per capita income; industrialisation and infrastructure is under-developed; climate-induced disasters are frequent; and maternal and infant mortality rates are high. Economic constraints combined with restrictive cultural norms create barriers for women in education, employment and decision-making, thus further entrenching unequal gender relations. This book explores the ways in which gender-sensitive and inclusive policies can be developed to address the basic issues of marginalisation, livelihood, poverty and vulnerability in the Eastern Himalayas. The chapters in the volume touch upon current concerns, such as the economic and social challenges faced by women, their control over resources, questions of patriarchy, discrimination, conflict, gender rights and equity, information, empowerment and participation, and women as agents of change. This volume will be useful to researchers and scholars in gender studies, sociology and social anthropology, development studies, economic and human geography, politics, northeast and Himalayan studies, South Asian studies, as well as policymakers and those in the development sector and non-governmental organisations. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Sanjoy Hazarika and Reshmi Banerjee; individual chapters, the contributors.";"";"";"";"";"";"";"BOOK";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032899360&doi=10.4324%2F9781315107943&partnerID=40&md5=adf3d2088e8d325b357d17a78d91d5bc"

Since 2000, comprehensive, population-based birth defects monitoring has been performed in selected regions of Ukraine to evaluate trends and to generate hypotheses regarding potential causes of unexplained variations in defect rates. Significantly higher rates of microcephaly, neural tube defects, and microphthalmia have been identified in selected regions of Ukraine collectively known as Polissia compared to adjacent regions collectively termed non-Polissia, and these significantly higher rates were evident particularly in the years 2000–2009. The Polissia regions have also demonstrated higher mean whole body counts of Cesium-137 compared to values in individuals residing in other non-Polissia regions. The potential causal relationship between persistent ionizing radiation pollution and selected congenital anomaly rates supports the need for a more thorough, targeted investigation of the sources of persistent ionizing radiation and the biological plausibility of a potential teratogenic effect. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS";"Chornobyl; Congenital malformations; Polissia; Pregnancy; Radiation; Ukraine; cesium 137; cesium; adult; Article; bladder exstrophy; Chernobyl accident; congenital malformation; conjoined twins; encephalocele; female; gastroschisis; human; infant mortality; ionizing radiation; live birth; major clinical study; male; microcephaly; microphthalmia; neural tube defect; nuclear power plant; omphalocele; radiation exposure; radiation injury; teratogenesis; teratoma; Ukraine; water supply; adverse effects; air pollution; isolation and purification; Microphthalmos; Neural Tube Defects; pathophysiology; pregnancy; radiation response; Air Pollution, Radioactive; Cesium Radioisotopes; Chernobyl Nuclear Accident; Female; Humans; Microcephaly; Pregnancy; Teratogenesis";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85001840600&doi=10.1016%2Fj.ejmg.2016.09.019&partnerID=40&md5=c342d7d87a397006051b1bfc447b05d0"

Methods: The data of pregnant women who experienced the earthquake in Fukushima prefecture and participated in the Pregnancy and Birth Survey as part of the Fukushima Health Management Survey were analyzed. The primary and secondary outcomes of this study were gestational duration and preterm birth, respectively. The main study factor was prenatal checkup institution (only one institution, changed institution due to self-referral, changed institution due to medical indication, and went to parents' home for childbirth). Self-referral was considered as indicative of relocation after the disaster. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of earthquake on each outcome. Results: A total of 5593 (60.2%) participants experienced the earthquake between the 4th and 37th weeks of their gestational period. After controlling for variables, pregnant women who changed their perinatal checkup institution due to medical indication were significantly associated with shorter gestational duration (β = −10.6, P < 0.001) and preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio, 8.5; 95% confidence interval, 5.8–12.5) compared with women who visited only one institution. Self-referral, however, was not significantly associated with the outcomes. Conclusion: According to prenatal checkup status, our results suggest that the effect on gestational duration of the Great East Japan Earthquake and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was not significant. © 2016 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology";"gestational duration; Great East Japan Earthquake; prenatal checkup; preterm birth; adult; Article; childbirth; controlled study; earthquake; female; gestation period; health center; human; infant; Japan; major clinical study; male; obstetric delivery; patient referral; perinatal care; pregnancy; premature labor; prenatal care; residential area; disaster; gestational age; health survey; maternal age; mental stress; pregnancy outcome; Premature Birth; utilization; young adult; Adult; Disasters; Earthquakes; Female; Gestational Age; Health Surveys; Humans; Maternal Age; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Prenatal Care; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994246976&doi=10.1111%2Fjog.13102&partnerID=40&md5=e7ddd6101eee9f8623cc60a31eddd5af"

Few studies have examined whether hurricane exposure is associated with preterm delivery. We aimed to estimate associations between maternal hurricane exposure and hazard of preterm delivery. Methods We used data on 342,942 singleton births from Florida Vital Statistics Records 2004–2005 to capture pregnancies at risk of delivery during the 2004 hurricane season. Maternal exposure to Hurricane Charley was assigned based on maximum wind speed in maternal county of residence. We estimated hazards of overall preterm delivery (<37 gestational weeks) and extremely preterm delivery (<32 gestational weeks) in Cox regression models, adjusting for maternal/pregnancy characteristics. To evaluate heterogeneity among racial/ethnic subgroups, we performed analyses stratified by race/ethnicity. Additional models investigated whether exposure to multiples hurricanes increased hazard relative to exposure to one hurricane. Results Exposure to wind speeds ≥39 mph from Hurricane Charley was associated with a 9 % (95 % CI 3, 16 %) increase in hazard of extremely preterm delivery, while exposure to wind speed ≥74 mph was associated with a 21 % (95 % CI 6, 38 %) increase. Associations appeared greater for Hispanic mothers compared to non-Hispanic white mothers. Hurricane exposure did not appear to be associated with hazard of overall preterm delivery. Exposure to multiple hurricanes did not appear more harmful than exposure to a single hurricane. Conclusions Hurricane exposure may increase hazard of extremely preterm delivery. As US coastal populations and hurricane severity increase, the associations between hurricane and preterm delivery should be further studied. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.";"Cox regression; Ethnicity; Hurricane; Preterm birth; Race; Time-varying; Vital statistics; adult; Caucasian; disaster; epidemiology; ethnology; female; Florida; gestational age; Hispanic; human; hurricane; mother; newborn; pregnancy; prematurity; proportional hazards model; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Cyclonic Storms; Disasters; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Gestational Age; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Mothers; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Proportional Hazards Models";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84982786579&doi=10.1007%2Fs10995-016-2069-y&partnerID=40&md5=91936c9d32c110d2e19c824edf2958d9"

Few studies have taken advantage of natural experiments to assess the relationship between ambient air pollutant concentrations and birth outcomes. Objectives: In this study we explored the effect of particulate matter with diameter of ≤ 10 μm (PM<inf>10</inf>) on perinatal outcomes in Uruguay, a middle-income country in South America with levels of PM<inf>10</inf> that in general do not exceed the recommended thresholds. The analyzed outcomes are preterm birth, term birth weight, and term low birth weight. Methods: We took advantage of the sharp variation in PM<inf>10</inf> concentrations due to the Puyehue eruptions to estimate the associations between mother’s exposure to PM<inf>10</inf> in each trimester of pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. We use birth registries for 2010-2013 and control for covariates, including maternal and pregnancy characteristics, weather, co-pollutants, and calendar quarter and hospital indicators. Results: A 10-μg/m3 increase in exposure to PM<inf>10</inf> during the third trimester was associated with a higher likelihood of a preterm birth [odds ratio (OR) = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.19]. The association was robust to different model specifications, and increased with categorical exposure levels (OR for third-trimester PM<inf>10</inf> ≥ 70 vs. < 30 μg/m3 = 5.24; 95% CI: 3.40, 8.08). Exposures were not consistently associated with birth weight or low birth weight among term births, though second-trimester exposures were associated with higher birth weight, contrary to expectations. Conclusions: Taking advantage of a natural experiment, we found evidence that exposure to high levels of PM<inf>10</inf> during the third trimester of pregnancy may have increased preterm births among women in Montevideo, Uruguay. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Method: The Red River Pregnancy Project was a prospective study carried out for 3 months immediately after the historic 2009 crest of the Red River in Fargo, North Dakota. Pregnant community residents who were at least 18 years old with a singleton, intrauterine pregnancy participated in the study (N = 169). Analyses examined if birth weight and length of gestation were associated with residential distance from flooding and gestational age at time of the flood crest. Results: For pregnancies earlier in gestation during the crest (-1 SD = 12 weeks), birth weight decreased as distance from flooding decreased (-42.29 g/mi, p < .01). For pregnancies later in gestation at crest (+1 SD = 26 weeks), distance was not associated with birth weight (p > .10). Biparietal growth trajectories showed a decrease in growth after the crest of the flood but only for women early in pregnancy. However, various measures of flood related and general stress or strain did not explain these effects. Length of gestation was not associated with distance from or the timing of the flood. Conclusions: Pregnant women in the first trimester who experience a major flood near their homes are at risk of having lower birth weight neonates due to a reduction in fetal growth.

It is difficult to accurately assess the risk of the effects of dzud on human lives and public health. This study aimed to evaluate the Mongolian public health risks of dzud by assessing livestock loss. Methods We analyzed data from all 21 provinces and Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia and compared the changes in infant mortality (2009-2010) and the decline in the numbers of livestock (percentage change from the previous year), which included horses, cattle, camels, sheep, and goats (2009-2010) and/or meteorological data. We also evaluated the association among the trends in the infant mortality rate, the number of livestock, and foodstuff consumption throughout Mongolia (2001-2012). Results The change in the infant mortality rate was positively correlated with the rate of decreasing numbers of each type of livestock in 2010. Average temperature and total precipitation were not related to the change in the infant mortality rate. In the trend from 2001 to 2012, there was a significant positive correlation between the infant mortality rate and the number of livestock and the consumption of milk products.

Results: One hundred and fifty-nine pregnant patients were screened. Sixty-two could be followed up until delivery. Thirty-nine (62.9%) delivered at term and 23 (37.1%) delivered prematurely. Significant risk factors for preterm delivery were a history of preterm delivery and group B streptococcus infection. Increased vaginal pH alone had no significant influence on preterm delivery, although there was a trend. Conclusion: The rate of preterm delivery was high in this cohort. We suggest risk stratification for preterm delivery in rural conditions by performing a vaginal pH and wet mount microscopy.

Methods The surveys examined the damages to maternity institutions, evacuation status and transport of pregnant women, and prehospital childbirths and were conducted in 50 maternity institutions and 12 fire departments in Miyagi. Results Two coastal institutions were destroyed completely, and four institutions were destroyed partially by the tsunami, forcing them to stop medical services. In the two-month period after the disaster, 217 pregnant women received hospital transport or gave birth after evacuation. Satisfactory perinatal outcomes were maintained. Emergency obstetric transport increased to approximately 1.4 fold the number before the disaster. Twenty-three women had prehospital childbirths, indicating a marked increase to approximately three times the number of the previous year. Conclusion In the acute phase of the tsunami disaster, maternity institutions were damaged severely and perinatal transport was not possible; as a result, pregnant women inevitably gave birth in unplanned institutions, and the number of prehospital births was increased extremely. To obtain satisfactory obstetric outcomes, it is necessary to construct a future disaster management system and to re-recognize pregnant women as people with special needs in disaster situations.

Methods: Yearly (2000-2012) population rates of NTDs and M/M and WBC patterns of ambulatory patients (2001-2010) and pregnant women (2011-2013) in Polissia and non-Polissia regions of Rivne were analyzed. Results: The NTD and M/M population rates in Rivne remain elevated and are statistically significantly higher in Polissia than in non-Polissia. The WBCs among residents in Polissia are statistically significantly higher than among those from non-Polissia. Conclusion: NTD and M/M rates are highest in the Polissia region of Rivne and are among the highest in Europe. In Polissia, the WBCs of Cs-137 are above officially set permissible upper limits. The results are based on aggregate data of NTDs and M/Ms and average WBC values. Further investigations of causality of the high rates of NTDs and M/Ms are needed and urgent strengthening policies and implementations to reduce exposures to teratogens, in particular radioactive nuclides and alcohol, and consumption of folic acid supplements are indicated. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.";"Cesium-137; Chornobyl; Malformations; Microphthalmia; Neural tube defects; Polissia; Pregnancy; Radiation; Ukraine; alcohol; cesium 137; folic acid; radioisotope; cesium; ambulatory care; Article; Chernobyl accident; controlled study; female; follow up; human; male; microcephaly; microphthalmia; neural tube defect; pregnant woman; priority journal; Ukraine; whole body counting; adult; incidence; maternal exposure; Microphthalmos; Neural Tube Defects; newborn; pregnancy; radiation exposure; statistical distribution; Adult; Cesium Radioisotopes; Chernobyl Nuclear Accident; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Exposure; Microcephaly; Pregnancy; Radiation Exposure; Statistical Distributions";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84975763937&doi=10.1002%2Fbdra.23476&partnerID=40&md5=e05faed177fd810d971edc5cb693a2f2"

Methods From the nationally representative Haiti 2012 Demographic and Health Survey, information on size of child at birth (too small or not) was available for 7280 singleton births in the previous 5 years, whereas information on birth weight was available for 1607 births. Pregnancy wantedness, short (<1 year) interpregnancy interval, and maternal-reported birth weight were compared before and after the earthquake and by level of damage. Multiple logistic regression and linear regression analyses were conducted. Results Post-earthquake births were less likely to be wanted and more likely to be born after a short interpregnancy interval. Earthquake exposure was associated with increased likelihood of a child being born too small: timing of birth (after earthquake vs. before earthquake, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-1.45), region (hardest-hit vs. rest of country; aOR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.14- 1.80), and house damage (aOR: 1.27 95% CI: 1.02-1.58). Mean birth weight was 150 to 300 g lower in those exposed to the earthquake.

Methods This study was conducted in conjunction with the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS). We examined 10,129 Japanese women using the primary fixed data of the JECS. The Kessler 6-item psychological distress scale (K6) was administered to 7473 eligible women including 998 in Miyagi unit center ('Miyagi UC') and 6475 in the other unit centers ('13UCs'). We compared the prevalence and the risk of distress (K6 ≥13) during pregnancy in 'Miyagi UC' and '13UCs'. Results More women in 'Miyagi UC' (4.9%) suffered psychological distress, compared with '13UCs' (3.1%) (p<0.001). A significantly higher prevalence of women in 'Miyagi UC' (55.5%) had experienced negative life events, whereas '13UCs' showed 42.7% (p<0.0001). In multivariable logistic analyses adjusted for baseline characteristics, there was a significant regional difference of psychological distress (adjusted odds ratio; aOR in Miyagi UC=1.488; 95%CI, 1.059-2.090). After further adjusting for negative life events, the association was diminished (aOR=1.338; 95%CI, 0.949-1.884). Limitations The JECS had no data before the earthquake and the extent of damage was not investigated. Possible regional representativeness is also a limitation. Conclusion After the Great East Japan Earthquake, the prevalence of pregnant women with psychological distress (K6≥13) were high in Miyagi prefecture. Especially in the coastal area directly affected by tsunami, it is high with or without negative life events experienced. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The question arises whether the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident entailed similar phenomena in Japan. For 47 prefectures representing 15.2 million births from 2001 to 2014, the Japanese government provides monthly statistics on 69,171 cases of perinatal death of the fetus or the newborn after 22 weeks of pregnancy to 7 days after birth. Employing change-point methodology for detecting alterations in longitudinal data, we analyzed time trends in perinatal mortality in the Japanese prefectures stratified by exposure to estimate and test potential increases in perinatal death proportions after Fukushima possibly associated with the earthquake, the tsunami, or the estimated radiation exposure. Areas with moderate to high levels of radiation were compared with less exposed and unaffected areas, as were highly contaminated areas hit versus untroubled by the earthquake and the tsunami. Ten months after the earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident, perinatal mortality in 6 severely contaminated prefectures jumped up from January 2012 onward: jump odds ratio 1.156; 95% confidence interval (1.061, 1.259), P-value 0.0009. There were slight increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. In severely contaminated areas, the increases of perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima were essentially independent of the numbers of dead and missing due to the earthquake and the tsunami. Perinatal mortality in areas contaminated with radioactive substances started to increase 10 months after the nuclear accident relative to the prevailing and stable secular downward trend. These results are consistent with findings in Europe after Chernobyl. Since observational studies as the one presented here may suggest but cannot prove causality because of unknown and uncontrolled factors or confounders, intensified research in various scientific disciplines is urgently needed to better qualify and quantify the association of natural and artificial environmental radiation with detrimental genetic health effects at the population level. © 2016 the Author(s).

This report serves to raise awareness that breastfeeding mothers and infants are a special population with unique needs during a disaster. Four of their concerns were identified during this massive flood: first, the negative impact of flood on infant nutritional status and their health; second, open space and lack of privacy for the mothers to breastfeed their babies comfortably at temporary shelters for flood victims; third, uncontrolled donations of infant formula, teats, and feeding bottles that are often received from many sources to promote formula feeding; and lastly, misconceptions related to breastfeeding production and quality that may be affected by the disaster. The susceptibility of women and their infant in a natural disaster enhances the benefits of promoting the breastfeeding rights of women. Women have the right to be supported which enables them to breastfeed. These can be achieved through monitoring the distribution of formula feeding, providing water, electricity and medical care for breastfeeding mothers and their infants.

This study aimed to examine effects of the Great East Japan Earthquake on perinatal outcomes using vital statistics of Japan. Methods: Birth registration data from vital statistics of Japan between March 2010 and March 2012 were used. Pregnant women who experienced the earthquake were categorized according to their gestational period as of March 11, 2011, as follows: gestational weeks 4-11, 12-19, 20-27, and 28-36 (2011 group). Similarly, pregnant women who did not experience the earthquake were categorized according to their gestational period as of March 11, 2010 and used as controls (2010 group). We also categorized prefectures as ""extremely affected"", ""moderately affected"", and ""slightly or unaffected"" regions. SSR, birth weight, and gestational period were compared between both groups. Results: The number of singleton births was 688 479 in the 2010 group and 679 131 in the 2011 group. In the extremely affected region, the SSR among women at 4-11 weeks of gestation was significantly lower in the 2011 group compared with the 2010 group (49.8% vs 52.1%, P = 0.009). In the extremely affected region, children born to women who experienced the earthquake at 28-36 weeks of gestation had significantly lower birth weights. Conclusions: The SSR declined among women who experienced the earthquake during early pregnancy, particularly in the extremely affected region. However, no apparent negative effect of the earthquake on perinatal outcomes was observed, although birth weight of infants who were born to women who experienced the earthquake at 28-36 weeks of gestation were lower. © 2015 Kohta Suzuki et al.";"Birth weight; Gestational duration; Maternal stress; Natural disaster; Secondary sex ratio; case control study; disaster; earthquake; epidemiology; female; gestational age; human; Japan; low birth weight; mental stress; newborn; pathophysiology; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; psychology; sex ratio; vital statistics; Case-Control Studies; Disasters; Earthquakes; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Pregnant Women; Sex Ratio; Stress, Psychological; Vital Statistics";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959273949&doi=10.2188%2Fjea.JE20150055&partnerID=40&md5=7b1d0b6bcc68b2112506d89574178404"

Methods: 308 New Orleans area pregnant women were interviewed 5–7 years after Hurricane Katrina about their exposure to the disaster (danger, damage, and injury); current disruption; and perceptions of recovery. Birthweight, gestational age, birth length, and head circumference were examined in linear models, and low birthweight (<2500 g) and preterm birth (<37 weeks) in logistic models, with adjustment for confounders. Results: Associations were found between experiencing damage during Katrina and birthweight (adjusted beta for high exposure = −158 g) and between injury and gestational age (adjusted beta = −0.5 days). Of the indicators of recovery experience, most consistently associated with worsened birth outcomes was worry that another hurricane would hit the region (adjusted beta for birthweight: −112 g, p = 0.08; gestational age: −3.2 days, p = 0.02; birth length: −0.65 cm, p = 0.06).

Data was extracted from all articles that met the inclusion criteria, and we systematically analyzed contents based on type of disaster, health outcome, target group and time after birth. Results: Prenatal exposure to famine or war was found to be associated with mental health, cardiovascular or metabolic outcomes, with varying degrees of significance. The majority of the studies showed limited or weak associations between exposures and outcomes. Conclusions: Due to the lack of variety in type of events studied, as well as large methodological variation, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from existing literature. However, our systematic review highlights the potential of evaluating secondary data, both to accentuate research gaps in the field and to increase the understanding of what effects various types of disasters potentially have on the unborn child. © 2015, Swiss School of Public Health.";"Man-made disasters; Natural disasters; Prenatal exposure; child; disaster; female; human; maternal welfare; mental health; perinatal care; posttraumatic stress disorder; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; prenatal exposure; psychology; warfare; Child; Disasters; Female; Humans; Maternal Welfare; Mental Health; Perinatal Care; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Warfare";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946492513&doi=10.1007%2Fs00038-015-0699-2&partnerID=40&md5=75201006a0f68f535fa2ccdc3d544f3d"

There was a significant effect (P < 0.05) of lambing number on litter size and birth weight, but not on weaning weight (P > 0.05). For litter size, the lowest numbers were obtained on the first lambing ewes (1.21 ± 0.03) and the highest ones inewes starting from the fourth lambing (1.69 ± 0.04). Lowest body weights were found in lambs born from first lambing ewes (3.01 ± 0.1 kg) and the highest ones in lambs born from the second (3.14 ± 0.1) to the fifth (3.15 ± 0.2) lambing ewes. The lambing breeding season had a significant effect on weaning weight: the highest weaning weights were recorded in lambs born in spring (12.70 ± 0.20 kg) and the lowest ones in those born in summer (11.93 ± 0.20 kg). Lambing year had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on litter size and weaning weight, since the values of both traits improved through the years. Effect of ram was significant (P < 0.05) for each of the traits considered: there were differences up to one lamb per litter, also differences up to 1.5 kg for birth weight and up to 6.5 kg for weaning weight among rams.

It has been hypothesized that during PNMS, glucocorticoids pass the placenta, reaching the foetus, leading to a long-term reprogramming and dysregulation of the foetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, results are inconsistent across PNMS studies. One problem may be the confounding of objective degrees of hardship due to the stressor and subjective degrees of distress in the mother. The present study investigated the association between objective and subjective PNMS due to a natural disaster, the June 2008 Iowa floods, and stress reactivity in the offspring at 21/2 years of age. Women who were pregnant during the floods were recruited, on average, within three months of the floods and their stress levels assessed. Mothers and their toddlers (. n=. 94. dyads) participated in a brief mother-toddler separation to induce physiological stress responses in the offspring. Salivary cortisol samples were collected four times during the procedure. We computed absolute change in cortisol (baseline to 20-minute post-stressor; baseline to 45-minute post-stressor) and Area Under the Curve with respect to increase and ground (AUCi; AUCg). Objective and subjective PNMS were positively correlated with AUCi, as was timing in gestation: the later in pregnancy the exposure occurred, the greater the cortisol increase. Controlling for objective hardship and other covariates, sex-by-subjective PNMS interactions showed a significant and positive association between subjective PNMS and Absolute Increase (45. min) and AUCi in females only, with little effect in males. These results suggest that PNMS leads to long-term alterations in the functioning of the HPA axis, evident as early as 30-months of age. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.";"Child development; Cortisol reactivity; Cortisol stress response; HPA axis; Prenatal stress; hydrocortisone; adult; Article; birth weight; child; child behavior; controlled study; early life stress; female; fetus outcome; fetus risk; flooding; hormone determination; hormone response; human; human experiment; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; longitudinal study; male; maternal deprivation; maternal stress; natural disaster; newborn assessment; prenatal exposure; prenatal stress; preschool child; priority journal; progeny; prospective study; provocation test; psychosocial development; risk assessment; saliva level; sex difference; chemistry; mental stress; metabolism; neuropsychological test; physiological stress; pregnancy; psychology; saliva; United States; Adult; Child, Preschool; Female; Floods; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Iowa; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Saliva; Stress, Physiological; Stress, Psychological";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84927779187&doi=10.1016%2Fj.psyneuen.2015.02.015&partnerID=40&md5=43bcf30df30c0abbfee337a3eda200bd"

Animal studies testing the fetal programming hypothesis find that maternal glucocorticoids pass through the placenta and alter fetal brain development, particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. However, there are no prospective studies of pregnant women exposed to a sudden-onset independent stressor that elucidate the biopsychosocial mechanisms responsible for the wide variety of consequences of prenatal stress seen in human offspring. The aim of the QF2011 Queensland Flood Study is to fill this gap, and to test the buffering effects of Midwifery Group Practice, a form of continuity of maternity care. Methods/design: In January 2011 Queensland, Australia had its worst flooding in 30 years. Simultaneously, researchers in Brisbane were collecting psychosocial data on pregnant women for a randomized control trial (the M@NGO Trial) comparing Midwifery Group Practice to standard care. We invited these and other pregnant women to participate in a prospective, longitudinal study of the effects of prenatal maternal stress from the floods on maternal, perinatal and early childhood outcomes. Data collection included assessment of objective hardship and subjective distress from the floods at recruitment and again 12 months post-flood. Biological samples included maternal bloods at 36 weeks pregnancy, umbilical cord, cord blood, and placental tissues at birth. Questionnaires assessing maternal and child outcomes were sent to women at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. The protocol includes assessments at 16 months, 2 1/2 and 4 years. Outcomes include maternal psychopathology, and the child's cognitive, behavioral, motor and physical development. Additional biological samples include maternal and child DNA, as well as child testosterone, diurnal and reactive cortisol. Discussion: This prenatal stress study is the first of its kind, and will fill important gaps in the literature. Analyses will determine the extent to which flood exposure influences the maternal biological stress response which may then affect the maternal-placental-fetal axis at the biological, biochemical, and molecular levels, altering fetal development and influencing outcomes in the offspring. The role of Midwifery Group Practice in moderating effects of maternal stress will be tested. © 2015 King et al.";"Child development; Cortisol; Developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD); DNA; Fetal programming; Natural disaster; Placenta; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Pregnancy; Prenatal stress; Article; assessment of humans; Australia; Autism Spectrum Rating Scale; Bayley Scales of Infant Development; Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; child; child behavior; Child Behavior Checklist; child development; child health; Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; environmental exposure; female; fetus development; fetus outcome; fetus risk; flooding; high risk pregnancy; human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; maternal blood; maternal stress; mental health; Mental Health Continuum Short Form; mother fetus relationship; Parenting and Family Adjustment Scale; Parenting Stress Index Short Form; Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire; Peritraumatic Distress Inventory; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; prenatal stress; psychological well being; Queensland Flood Objective Stress Scale; retrospective study; risk assessment; Short Temperament Scale for Infant; Social Support Questionnaire; Spence Childhood Anxiety Scale; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; STORM32 questionnaire; theory of mind; Trauma History Questionnaire; umbilical cord blood; Wechsler Intelligence Scale; adult; disaster; follow up; gestational age; infant; longitudinal study; male; mental stress; newborn; pathophysiology; physiology; pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; prenatal exposure; preschool child; prospective study; psychology; Queensland; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Adult; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Disasters; Female; Fetal Development; Floods; Follow-Up Studies; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Prospective Studies; Stress, Psychological";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84938077211&doi=10.1186%2Fs12884-015-0539-7&partnerID=40&md5=5ce1b4c92dd09e171102f6799eb8e224"

As a result, the routine health care and the special needs of some vulnerable populations such as pregnant and postpartum women may be overlooked within a resource-limited setting. In the event of hazards such as natural disasters, manmade disasters, and terrorism, knowledge of emergency preparedness strategies is imperative for the pregnant woman and her family, obstetric providers, and hospitals. Individualized plans for the pregnant woman and her family should include knowledge of shelter in place, birth at home, and evacuation. Obstetric providers need to have a personal disaster plan in place that accounts for work responsibilities in case of an emergency and business continuity strategies to continue to provide care to their communities. Hospitals should have a comprehensive emergency preparedness program utilizing an ""all hazards"" approach to meet the needs of pregnant and postpartum women and other vulnerable populations during disasters.

Participants: The study included 146 women (122 from New Orleans and 24 from Baton Rouge), who were pregnant during or immediately after Hurricane Katrina. Methods: Participants were interviewed regarding their hurricane experiences and perceived stress, and coping styles were assessed using the Brief COPE. Medical charts were also reviewed to obtain information about pregnancy outcomes. Logistic regression was performed to determine possible associations. Results: Hurricane exposure was significantly associated with induction of labor (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.03, 1.86], P = .03) and current perceived stress (aOR = 1.50, CI [1.34, 1.99], P < .01).

In this report, we focus on those women immediately after the Great East Japan Earthquake and Fukushima NPP accident and discuss their support needs.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data regarding 61 miscarriages, 5 abortions, and 22 stillbirths were analyzed among the women who were pregnant at the time of the accident in the present study. We used a two-item case-finding instrument for depression screening, and compared the childbirth group with the fetal loss groups. We also analyzed mothers' opinions written as free-form text.RESULTS: Among the three fetal loss groups, the proportion of positive depression screens was significantly higher in the miscarriage and stillbirth group than in the childbirth group. Mothers' opinions were grouped into six categories, with pregnancy-related items being most common, especially in the miscarriage and stillbirth groups.CONCLUSION: A higher proportion of Fukushima mothers with fetal loss, especially those with miscarriage and stillbirth, had depressive symptoms compared to those who experienced childbirth.

This study examined whether postneonatal childhood mortality differed between university and central hospital districts in Finland from 1985 to 2004 and whether the causes of death were preventable. Methods We analysed postneonatal childhood mortality in Finland during two 10-year periods - 1985 to 1994 and 1995 to 2004 - analysing university and central hospital districts separately, as paediatric intensive care is centralised in university hospitals. The study looked at the main causes of death in each hospital, and the mortality rates were adjusted to demonstrate how many children were at risk of dying. Results Postneonatal childhood mortality decreased during the study period in university and central hospital districts. We found no significant difference in mortality rates between university hospital districts, but regional differences were notable in central hospital districts, partly because of historical differences in mortality. Accidents were the most common cause of death, with substantial regional differences. Conclusion Regional postneonatal childhood mortality differed across central hospital districts, and this should be taken into account in the forthcoming restructuring of the Finnish healthcare system.

However, human studies remain limited. Natural disasters provide models of independent stressors unrelated to confounding maternal characteristics. We assessed degree of objective hardship and subjective distress in women pregnant during severe flooding. At ages 2.5 and 4 years we assessed body mass index (BMI), subscapular plus triceps skinfolds (SS + TR, an index of total adiposity), and SS: TR ratio (an index of central adiposity) in their children (n=106). Hierarchical regressions controlled first for several potential confounds. Controlling for these, flood exposure during early gestation predicted greater BMI increase from age 2.5 to 4, as well as total adiposity at 2.5. Greater maternal hardship and distress due to the floods, as well as other nonflood life events during pregnancy, independently predicted greater increase in total adiposity between 2.5 and 4 years. These results support the hypothesis that prenatal stress increases adiposity beginning in childhood and suggest that early gestation is a sensitive period.

To identify factors associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) attrition among patients initiating therapy in 2005-2011 at two large, public-sector department-level hospitals, and to inform interventions to improve ART retention. Methods. This retrospective cohort study used data from the iSanté electronic medical record (EMR) system. The study characterized ART attrition levels and explored the patient demographic, clinical, temporal, and service utilization factors associated with ART attrition, using time-to-event analysis methods. Results. Among the 2?023 patients in the study, ART attrition on average was 17.0 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI): 15.8-18.3). In adjusted analyses, risk of ART attrition was up to 89% higher for patients living in distant communes compared to patients living in the same commune as the hospital (hazard ratio: 1.89, 95%CI: 1.54-2.33; P < 0.001). Hospital site, earlier year of ART start, spending less time enrolled in HIV care prior to ART initiation, receiving a non-standard ART regimen, lacking counseling prior to ART initiation, and having a higher body mass index were also associated with attrition risk. Conclusions. The findings suggest quality improvement interventions at the two hospitals, including: enhanced retention support and transportation subsidies for patients accessing care from remote areas; counseling for all patients prior to ART initiation; timely outreach to patients who miss ART pick-ups; ""bridging services"" for patients transferring care to alternative facilities; routine screening for anticipated interruptions in future ART pick-ups; and medical case review for patients placed on non-standard ART regimens.

The objective of this report is to describe some results of a questionnaire-based pregnancy and birth survey conducted by the Radiation Medical Science Center for the Fukushima Health Management Survey.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to women who received maternal and child health handbooks from municipal officers in Fukushima Prefecture between 1 August 2010 and 31 July 2011, with the aim of reaching those who were pregnant at the time of the disaster. Mailing began 18 January 2012. Data were analyzed separately for six geographic areas in Fukushima Prefecture.RESULTS: The total number of women meeting survey criteria was 15,972. The number of responses received to date is 9,298 (58.2%). Data from 8602 respondents were analyzed after excluding 634 invalid responses and 5 induced and 57 spontaneous abortions (less than 22 gestational weeks). The incidences of stillbirth (over 22 completed gestational weeks), preterm birth, low birth weight and congenital anomalies were 0.25%, 4.4%, 8.7% and 2.72%, respectively. These incidences are similar to recent averages elsewhere in Japan.CONCLUSION: Considering the pregnancy and birth survey data in aggregate, our disaster seemed to provoke no significant adverse outcomes over the whole of Fukushima prefecture.

A broad literature relates negative birth outcomes to poor educational performance, and a number of recent studies have examined the effect of prenatal exposure to natural disasters on birth outcomes. This study takes the next step by considering how prenatal exposure affects later outcomes. Combining North Carolina administrative data on births and school performance with disaster declarations from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) allows for the identification of children who were exposed to disasters during prenatal development. These children are compared with other children born in the same county who were not exposed to disasters while in utero. Regression results suggest that children exposed to hurricanes prenatally have lower scores on third grade standardized tests in math and reading. Those exposed to flooding or tornadoes also have somewhat lower math scores. Additionally, results suggest that these negative effects are more concentrated among children in disadvantaged subgroups, especially children born to black mothers. However, no evidence exists that these effects are mediated by common measures of birth outcomes, including birth weight and gestational age. © 2014 Population Association of America.";"Academic achievement; Birth weight; Natural disaster; Prenatal development; adult; article; birth weight; disaster; educational status; female; gestational age; human; male; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; prenatal exposure; school; socioeconomics; statistics; United States; Adult; Birth Weight; Disasters; Educational Status; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Male; North Carolina; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Schools; Socioeconomic Factors";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905013331&doi=10.1007%2Fs13524-014-0310-0&partnerID=40&md5=9316b25eea015ce67ce32676e54a282c"

Design: A descriptive, longitudinal study. Setting: A university-affiliated hospital in Pathum Thani, Thailand. Participants: Pregnant women (N = 175) in the third trimester that had uncomplicated pregnancies and no history of mental illness. Methods: During pregnancy, the participants completed standardized measurements of depression symptoms, perceived social support, and questionnaires concerning the effect of the flood. After giving birth, infant birth weight and gestational age at birth were retrieved from delivery records. Results: Seventy percent (n = 123) of the participants experienced displacement during the flood. The displaced women had a mean infant birth weight of 175 grams less than that of the nondisplaced women, t(173) = -2.38, p = .02, whereas infant gestational age was not different. Displacement and other variables explained approximately 8% of the variance in infant birth weight. The interaction term between displacement and perceived social support was statistically significant and additionally explained the variance in infant birth weight, F(6, 168) = 3.24, p = .005. Conclusion: Being displaced during pregnancy due to a natural disaster affected fetal growth rather than length of gestation. Health care providers should closely monitor maternal weight gain and fetal growth of pregnant women who experience displacement. Among the displaced women, social support was associated with higher infant birth weight; therefore, high levels of perceived social support may be protective for pregnant women who experience stressful events such as displacement from flooding. © 2014 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.";"Birth outcomes; Displacement; Natural disaster; Social support; adult; disaster; female; Fetal Growth Retardation; flooding; gestational age; housing; human; longitudinal study; low birth weight; mental stress; newborn; pathophysiology; pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; pregnancy outcome; prevention and control; psychology; social support; statistics and numerical data; Thailand; third trimester pregnancy; Adult; Disasters; Female; Floods; Gestational Age; Housing; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Longitudinal Studies; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Social Support; Stress, Psychological";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904473167&doi=10.1111%2F1552-6909.12466&partnerID=40&md5=dd632e3dc3b6e609aa24601ea6a3a736"

The world's literature on the impact of disasters on women is reviewed. Sixty-three members of the IMSuRT and Disaster Medical Assistance Team set up a mobile surgical field hospital after the 2010 Haitian earthquake. One member (AG) managed all the obstetrical care and taught the other team members essentials of labor management and assessment in pregnancy. Six hundred patients were treated in the first 14 days. Ten percent of these patients were pregnant.There were 12 deliveries. All pregnant patients were evaluated by a Sonosite ultrasound device. Pregnant patients with earthquake-related injuries were treated for their injuries.Women in labor were managed by active management in labor. No cesarean sections were needed. Well-being of mother and babies. Sixty pregnant women presented to the mobile hospital for evaluation from January 17, 2010, through January 28, 2012. Twelve women in labor delivered healthy infants by vaginal delivery. Gestational ages ranges from 34 to 40 weeks. Active management of labor included the use of intravenous Pitocin, which was titrated to contractions. Duration of labor ranged from 2 to 12 hours. Three team members participated in each delivery. Two women were discharged on the same day as their deliveries. Eight women were discharged on the first postpartum day and two on the second postpartum day. Pregnant women suffered severe injuries. Additionally, pregnant women with pre-existing medical conditions were treated after the earthquake. Active management of labor allowed all women to deliver vaginally. The labor management required tremendous team resources to facilitate vaginal deliveries and avoid cesarean sections. Cesarean sections in an austere environment have the potential for devastating consequences such as sepsis, wound dehiscence, and the long-term risks of uterine rupture with subsequent pregnancies.

Cross-sectional logistic regression analyses are performed testing the association between pre-HKR accumulation of Pb in soils in thirty-two neighborhoods and eclampsia risk. Then we examine whether measured declines in soil Pb following the flooding of the city resulted in corresponding reductions of eclampsia risk. Results: Cross-sectional analyses show that a one standard deviation increase in soil Pb increases the odds of eclampsia by a factor of 1.48 (95% CI: 1.31, 1.66). Mothers in zip code areas with soil Pb>333. mg/kg were 4.00 (95% CI: 3.00, 5.35) times more likely to experience eclampsia than mothers residing in neighborhoods with soil Pb<50. mg/kg. Difference-in-differences analyses capturing the exogenous reduction in soil Pb following the 2005 flooding of New Orleans indicate that mothers residing in zip codes experiencing decrease in soil Pb (-387.9 to -33.6. mg/kg) experienced a significant decline in eclampsia risk (OR=0.619; 95% CI: 0.397, 0.963).

The aim of this study was to identify predictors of postpartum depression among survivors of the 1988 devastating earthquake in Armenia. A nested case-control design was applied to investigate postpartum depression in a large-scale cohort of survivors followed between 1990 and 2012. From an original group of 725 adults who were assessed for psychopathology in 1990, 146 women reported having a delivery after the earthquake and were included in this study. Women with postpartum depression were identified using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. A logistic regression model was fitted to identify the predictors of postpartum depression. Of the 146 women, 19 (13.0 %) had postpartum depression. Five independent predictors of postpartum depression were identified: number of woman's stressful life events (odds ratio (OR)=2.06), her prior history of postpartum depression (OR=16.98), delivering sick/dead neonate (OR=13.65), poor living standards during the post-earthquake decade (OR=5.77), and perceiving oneself reliable in 1990 (OR=0.24). Anxiety in 1990 was marginally significantly related to the outcome (OR=3.75). The rate of postpartum depression in this 22-year cohort was similar to that among the Armenian general population. Earthquake exposure was not related to postpartum depression, indicating that the impact of disaster-related trauma diminishes over time. The identified predictors provided evidence to develop interventions targeting groups of women most prone to postpartum depression under such circumstances. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.";"Armenia; Earthquake survivors; Postpartum depression; Predictors; adult; anxiety; article; case control study; controlled study; delivery; earthquake; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; female; follow up; human; life event; major clinical study; priority journal; puerperal depression; receiver operating characteristic; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; survivor; Anxiety Disorders; Armenia; Depression, Postpartum; interview; psychology; questionnaire; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Adult; Anxiety; Case-Control Studies; Earthquakes; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Life Change Events; Questionnaires; Survivors";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901682354&doi=10.1007%2Fs00737-013-0404-5&partnerID=40&md5=6b7653491a2cd7d73891b32ec070fa0c"

While some studies have assessed the mental and physical wellbeing of disaster victims, few have examined the long-term impact of natural disasters on pregnant women's mental health. As such, this study aims to assess whether the Sichuan earthquake continues to negatively affect women's mental health, 4 years since its occurrence. In addition, predictive and protective risk factors of depressive symptoms among pregnant women were also identified. Methods From June 2012 to October 2012, 520 pregnant women were interviewed, of whom 253 were from an earthquake struck area and 267 were from a non-earthquake struck area. Symptoms of antenatal depression were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) with a cutoff of≥10. Results The prevalence rate of depression among pregnant women in the earthquake area was 34.5% (95% CI, 28.9-40.6), while the rate in the non-earthquake area was 39.6% (95% CI, 33.9-45.5). The perceived stresses associated with pregnancy and social support from husbands are significantly correlated with antenatal depression. Limitations: Lack of diagnosis for antenatal depression and it is a self-report evaluation. Conclusions This study found that the Sichuan earthquake does not necessarily have a long-lasting effect on pregnant women who were once victims of the disaster. It was found that pregnant women who experience high levels of pressures from the pregnancy and receive medium support from husbands are more susceptible to experience antenatal depression than pregnant women who perceive higher levels of support from husbands. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.";"Depression; Mental health; Pregnant women; Sichuan earthquake; adult; affect; article; China; controlled study; depression; earthquake; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; female; human; life satisfaction; major clinical study; marriage; mental health; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prenatal care; priority journal; risk factor; self report; social support; stress; Depression; Mental health; Pregnant women; Sichuan earthquake; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disasters; Earthquakes; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnant Women; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Young Adult";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885480971&doi=10.1016%2Fj.jad.2013.06.048&partnerID=40&md5=1a13f4f142283df9f48c2dad6b42341f"

Suggested measures that the Haitian government and international donor community can take to maintain these gains are also made. With the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) deadline of 2015 drawing nearer, the likelihood that Haiti will achieve MDG's 4 and 5 of reducing child and maternal mortality by two-thirds and three-quarters, respectively, by the end of this target year, remain questionable. In particular, the destruction inflicted on the country's health care system and health infrastructure by the 2010 earthquake have already resulted in a slowing of these gains and could potentially threaten an actual reversal of these trends. The country's Soins Obstétricaux Gratuits and Soins Infantiles Gratuits schemes established in 2008 and 2010, which provide free health care to women, newborns and children under 5, represent examples of measures that will need to be sustained and scaled up if the country is to meet its MDG 4 and 5 targets. The Haitian government's endorsement of an increased continuum of care approach to maternal and newborn health will also be vital for future initiatives. Post-quake public health and social service reconstruction efforts will need to incorporate maternal and child health-friendly services into their designs. It also remains critical that international donors continue to meet their pledges to Haiti. The Haitian government should also take more strides to clearly delineate the maternal and child health interventions it implements, both in order to facilitate greater national learning, as well as to improve the likelihood of future replication. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.";"Child mortality; Donor support; Haiti reconstruction; Maternal mortality; Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5; article; child; child health care; child welfare; childhood mortality; earthquake; female; Haiti; health care delivery; health care policy; health service; human; infant mortality; maternal mortality; motivation; newborn; pregnancy; public health; socioeconomics; United Nations; trends; Child; Child Health Services; Child Mortality; Child Welfare; Delivery of Health Care; Earthquakes; Female; Goals; Health Policy; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Health Services; Maternal Mortality; Pregnancy; Public Health; Socioeconomic Factors";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885954917&doi=10.1007%2Fs10995-012-1170-0&partnerID=40&md5=1033c4f015df6d8e31040dd14fc6ea1b"

We use monthly birth cohorts to determine if Japanese male births following the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 fell below levels expected from female births and from history (i.e., autocorrelation) among cohorts exposed to the Earthquake at or after conception. Methods: We apply interrupted time-series methods to 69 months (i.e., April, 2006 through December, 2011) of birth data from the most and least affected prefectures as well as from the remainder of Japan. We estimate expected male births from female births and from autocorrelation. Results: Findings varied by distance from the greatest damage but suggest sensitive periods both early and late in gestation when population stressors may induce selection against males in utero. Support for reduced conception of males appeared only in the prefectures most damaged by the Earthquake. Conclusions: Results align with the claim that natural selection has conserved mechanisms that reduce the odds of a male live birth during stressful times by reducing the conception of males and by increasing the rate of spontaneous abortion among male fetuses.

We conducted a systematic literature review of 1,635 articles and reports published in peer-reviewed journals or by the government from January 1981 through December 2010. We classified the studies using three exposure types: (1) physical exposure to toxicants; (2) psychological trauma; and (3) general exposure to disaster. Fifteen articles met our inclusion criteria concerning research focus and design. Overall studies pertained to eight different disasters, with most (n = 6) focused on the World Trade Center attack. Only one study examined pregnancy loss, i.e., occurrence of spontaneous abortions post-disaster. Most studies focused on associations between disaster and adverse birth outcomes, but two studies pertained only to post-disaster fertility while another two examined it in addition to adverse birth outcomes. In most studies disaster-affected populations were assumed to have experienced psychological trauma, but exposure to trauma was measured in only four studies. Furthermore, effects of both physical exposure to toxicants and psychological trauma on disaster-affected populations were examined in only one study. Effects on birth outcomes were not consistently demonstrated, and study methodologies varied widely. Even so, these studies suggest an association between disasters and reproductive health and highlight the need for further studies to clarify associations. We postulate that post-disaster surveillance among pregnant women could improve our understanding of effects of disaster on the reproductive health of US pregnant women. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).";"Birth outcomes; Disaster; Fertility; Low birth weight; Preterm birth; disaster; female; fertility; human; low birth weight; posttraumatic stress disorder; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; prematurity; psychological aspect; reproductive health; review; United States; psychology; Disasters; Female; Fertility; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Premature Birth; Reproductive Health; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879100101&doi=10.1007%2Fs10995-012-1068-x&partnerID=40&md5=6ace53a5fb8ae76851e627c761b757de"

Some of the estimates in this literature may be affected by small samples, omitted variables, endogenous mobility in response to disasters, and errors in the measurement of gestation, as well as by a mechanical correlation between longer gestation and the probability of having been exposed. We use millions of individual birth records to examine the effects of exposure to hurricanes during pregnancy, and the sensitivity of the estimates to these econometric problems. We find that exposure to a hurricane during pregnancy increases the probability of abnormal conditions of the newborn such as being on a ventilator more than 30. min and meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Although we are able to reproduce previous estimates of effects on birth weight and gestation, our results suggest that measured effects of stressful events on these outcomes are sensitive to specification and it is preferable to use more sensitive indicators of newborn health. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..";"Birth weight; Disaster; Gestation; Pregnancy; Stress; disaster; hurricane; pregnancy; adult; article; assisted ventilation; birth weight; cesarean section; female; gestation period; human; life event; maternal behavior; maternal care; maternal stress; meconium aspiration; migration; newborn; pregnancy outcome; third trimester pregnancy; United States; Adult; Birth Certificates; Cyclonic Storms; Disasters; Empirical Research; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Risk Factors; Stress, Psychological; Texas; Young Adult";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875271503&doi=10.1016%2Fj.jhealeco.2013.01.004&partnerID=40&md5=820b78a7915c9d8b200da6ab4417b620"

Study Design A clinical retrospective survey. Result Five hundred and twenty-four women were lost to follow-up, and data from the remaining 1770 women were analyzed. The completed questionnaires revealed that 80.11% (1418/1770) became pregnant following IUD removal and about 88% (1256) of whom conceived within 1 year. Among women with different durations of IUD use, pregnancy rates and miscarriage rates were as follows: < 5 years, 89.77% and 4.27%; 6-10 years, 81.10% and 10.19%; and > 10 years, 75.20% and 12.98%, respectively. Age, duration of IUD use, a history of a previous miscarriage and abnormal menstruation before the earthquake were independently associated with reduced fertility, but a higher gravidity pre-earthquake was associated with a higher conception rate.

Awareness of RH needs in emergencies began in the mid-1990s and led to the formation of the Inter-Agency Working Group (IAWG) for RH. Subsequently, the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP), a set of guidelines for RH service delivery in crisis settings, was created. The objectives of the MISP are to facilitate the coordination of RH services, prevent and manage the consequences of sexual violence, reduce HIV transmission, minimize maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, and plan for comprehensive RH services in the post-crisis phase. Available documentation on MISP implementation is minimal, and reveals mixed success. Challenges include low MISP awareness, inadequate RH training among humanitarian actors, logistical difficulties and poor coordination. Continued emphasis on advocacy and capacity building, a stronger focus on logistics and coordination and a greater commitment to monitoring and evaluation are essential for improving the MISP's effectiveness in the field. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.";"disasters; emergencies; MISP; reproductive health; article; awareness; data base; disease transmission; health care delivery; health care planning; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; maternal morbidity; maternal mortality; methodology; Minimum Initial Service Package; newborn morbidity; newborn mortality; practice guideline; priority journal; reproductive health; sexual violence; violence; Developing Countries; Efficiency, Organizational; Emergencies; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Reproductive Health Services; Sex Offenses; War";"";"";"";"";"";"JOUR";"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875367197&doi=10.1080%2F17441692.2013.765024&partnerID=40&md5=2ba4cee585aa0aaff8c20b39702b8e64"

The radioactive contamination of the studied territories as well as the total effective dose of radiation for the population was evaluated by the results of the general dosimetric dose established for settlements of Ukraine. Factors of the work environment (noise, microclimate, dust, bacterial air pollution, work intensity and strain) were studied by the common hygienic methods and assessed by the criteria of the ""Hygienic Classification of Work..."" # 4137-86. The residues of pesticides, their isomers and products of transformation in biological fluids (blood, breast milk, cord blood) were assayed by gas-liquid chromatography method and electron capture detector with the device ""Kristallux 4000"" and the model M-3700. Correlative, regression, and discriminative analyses were used for mathematical processing of the data.RESULTS: It is proved that the reproductive health of rural women has become significantly worse after the Chornobyl accident, the most expressed disorders are seen in young women aged under 30. Worsening of reproductive health is found being the result of a combined effect of factors of radioactive and nonradioactive nature, specific for territories of residence, occupational activity and style of life. In particular, the effect of pesticides at the background of the radioactive contamination is likely to be an additional risk factor of disorders of the reproductive health of women. According to the biomonitoring data the content of organochlorine pesticides in biological fluids of women with reproductive health disorders was significantly higher (p<0.05) vs. with healthy ones. It is established that women of the childbearing age residing on territories with the density of contamination of more than 5 Ci/km and with rates of pesticide load over 5 kg/ha should be referred to a high risk group of the reproductive health disorders.CONCLUSION: The perspectives of epidemiological studies on the reproductive health are related on the use of the combination of many-aspect healthcare and biological approaches. It is equally important to assess adequately the factors of environment and work-related conditions, and their combined effect with dwelling load.; Abstract available from the publisher. Kundiev Ju.

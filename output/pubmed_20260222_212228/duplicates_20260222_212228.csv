In the United States, Fukushima fallout arrived just six days after the earthquake, tsunami, and meltdowns. Some samples of radioactivity in precipitation, air, water, and milk, taken by the U.S. government, showed levels hundreds of times above normal; however, the small number of samples prohibits any credible analysis of temporal trends and spatial comparisons. U.S. health officials report weekly deaths by age in 122 cities, about 25 to 35 percent of the national total. Deaths rose 4.46 percent from 2010 to 2011 in the 14 weeks after the arrival of Japanese fallout, compared with a 2.34 percent increase in the prior 14 weeks. The number of infant deaths after Fukushima rose 1.80 percent, compared with a previous 8.37 percent decrease. Projecting these figures for the entire United States yields 13,983 total deaths and 822 infant deaths in excess of the expected. These preliminary data need to be followed up, especially in the light of similar preliminary U.S. mortality findings for the four months after Chernobyl fallout arrived in 1986, which approximated final figures.";;"Age Distribution; Air Pollutants, Radioactive; Cause of Death; Health Status; Humans; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Japan; Northwestern United States; Nuclear Power Plants; Radiation Injuries; Radioactive Hazard Release; United States; Vital Statistics";Radioactive Hazard Release;;Infant Mortality;eng;Journal Article;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22403909/

Mangano and Janette D. Sherman suggesting that a large increase in U.S. deaths soon after Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant accident could be caused by radiation released from this accident and arriving in the United States. This author attributes the increase to the authors' inclusion of a higher number of cities in their study before and after Fukushima (119 and 104 cities, respectively).;;"Air Pollutants, Radioactive; Humans; Infant Mortality; Nuclear Power Plants; Radiation Injuries; Radioactive Hazard Release";Radioactive Hazard Release;;Infant Mortality;eng;Journal Article;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22993969/

Mangano and Janette D. Sherman suggesting that an increase in U.S. deaths shortly after Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant accident could be attributed to radiation from this accident arriving in the United States. The author writes that the cause of these deaths has not been analyzed and that there is no known mechanism for low-dose radiation to cause acute death in infants or adults. The author also notes that the cities under study with the lowest radiation fallout have the highest increases of death rates in the 14 weeks following Fukushima, while the Californian cities that would have received larger doses saw a decrease in death rate growth. He concludes that innumerable factors other than radiation likely are responsible for the bulk of the measured effect.;;"Air Pollutants, Radioactive; Humans; Infant Mortality; Nuclear Power Plants; Radiation Injuries; Radioactive Hazard Release";Radioactive Hazard Release;;Infant Mortality;eng;Journal Article;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22993968/

Pregnant women or women in the postpartum period with acute-onset, severe systolic hypertension; severe diastolic hypertension; or both require urgent antihypertensive therapy. Introducing standardized, evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of adverse maternal outcomes. Individuals and institutions should have mechanisms in place to initiate the prompt administration of medication when a patient presents with a hypertensive emergency. Treatment with first-line agents should be expeditious and occur as soon as possible within 30-60 minutes of confirmed severe hypertension to reduce the risk of maternal stroke. Intravenous labetalol and hydralazine have long been considered first-line medications for the management of acute-onset, severe hypertension in pregnant women and women in the postpartum period. Although relatively less information currently exists for the use of calcium channel blockers for this clinical indication, the available evidence suggests that immediate release oral nifedipine also may be considered as a first-line therapy, particularly when intravenous access is not available. In the rare circumstance that intravenous bolus labetalol, hydralazine, or immediate release oral nifedipine fails to relieve acute-onset, severe hypertension and is given in successive appropriate doses, emergent consultation with an anesthesiologist, maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist, or critical care subspecialist to discuss second-line intervention is recommended.";;"Antihypertensive Agents; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Drug Administration Routes; Emergencies; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Labetalol; Medication Therapy Management; Nifedipine; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular; Puerperal Disorders; Quality Improvement; Referral and Consultation; Severity of Illness Index; United States";Emergencies;"Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular; Puerperal Disorders";;eng;Journal Article;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28333812/

AB  - Flood is one of the natural disasters with high prevalence in the world. The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of flood on pregnancy outcome and pregnancy complication such as preterm birth, LBW, SGA, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia and eclampsia. This is a systematic review based on the PRISMA model that examines pregnancy disorder, pregnancy complication, and reproductive outcomes in floods. For fulfilling of the objectives of the research, related keywords were identified using Mesh and Emtree databases. Then the search was done in the electronic database of Medline, Web of Science, Embase, scopus until 2021.2.10. The search strategy in the Medline database. Database searches resulted in 823 non-duplicate records. After reading the abstracts, 808 articles were excluded. 15 abstracts were eligible for the study, which their full texts were provided. Finally based on inclusion and exclusion criteria 7 articles were included in this study. After flood, the rate of LBW birth and gestational hypertension increases. However, there is no significant difference in preterm birth rates. Pregnancy complications can be reduced or prevented by starting prenatal care early and also by controlling risk factors such as reducing smoking and alcohol consumption.

AB  - To document changes in birth rates, birth outcomes, and pregnancy risk factors among women giving birth after the 1997 Red River flood in North Dakota. We analyzed detailed county-level birth files pre-disaster (1994-1996) and post-disaster (1997-2000) in North Dakota. Crude birth rates and adjusted fertility rates were calculated. The demographic and pregnancy risk factors were described among women delivering singleton births. Logistic regression was conducted to examine associations between the disaster and low birth weight (< 2,500 g), preterm birth (< 37 weeks), and small for gestational age infants adjusting for confounders. The crude birth rate and direct-adjusted fertility rate decreased significantly after the disaster in North Dakota. The proportion of women giving birth who were older, non-white, unmarried, and had a higher education increased. Compared to pre-disaster, there were significant increases in the following maternal measures after the disaster: any medical risks (5.1-7.1%), anemia (0.7-1.1%), acute or chronic lung disease (0.4-0.5%), eclampsia (0.3-2.1%), and uterine bleeding (0.3-0.4%). In addition, there was a significant increase in births that were low birth weight (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03-1.21) and preterm (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.16) after adjusting for maternal characteristics and smoking. Following the flood, there was an increase in medical risks, low birth weight, and preterm delivery among women giving birth in North Dakota. Further research that examines birth outcomes of women following a catastrophic disaster is warranted.

AB  - Colorado is regularly impacted by long-range transport of wildfire smoke from upwind regions. This smoke is a major source of ambient PM2.5. Maternal exposure to total PM2.5 during pregnancy has been linked to decreased birth weight and other adverse outcomes, although the impact of wildfire smoke contribution has only recently been investigated. The objective of this study was to estimate associations between adverse pregnancy outcomes and ambient wildfire smoke PM2.5. Wildfire smoke PM2.5 exposures were estimated using a previously published method incorporating ground-based monitors and remote sensing data. Logistic regression models stratified by ZIP code and mixed models with random intercept by ZIP code were used to test for associations. The primary outcomes of interest were preterm birth and birth weight. Secondary outcomes included gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, neonatal intensive care unit admission, assisted ventilation, small for gestational age, and low birth weight. Exposure to wildfire smoke PM2.5 over the full gestation and during the second trimester were positively associated with pre-term birth (OR = 1.076 (mu g/m(3))(-1) [95% CI = 1.016, 1.139; p = 0.013] and 1.132 (mu g/m(3))(-1) [95% CI = 1.088, 1.178]; p < 0.0001, respectively), while exposure during the first trimester was associated with decreased birth weight (-5.7 g/(mu g/m(3)) [95% CI: -11.1, -0.4; p = 0.036]). Secondary outcomes were mixed.

AB  - Global warming has increased the frequency of natural disasters, such as cyclones. Mozambique is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to extreme weather events. Natural disasters particularly affect vulnerable people, including preterm and critical ill infants of Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). Literature on NICU evacuations in the case of a natural disaster has been reported in high-resource settings, but it is lacking in low-resource settings. On the 14th of March 2019, a tropical cyclone (Idai) hit Mozambique. This report is a descriptive analysis of the experience of the NICU evacuation and care during and after cyclone Idai at Beira Central Hospital, Beira, Mozambique.

AB  - There are limited studies on the long-term effects of natural/environmental disasters, especially nuclear disasters, on obstetric outcomes. This study aimed to review the results of perinatal outcomes immediately after the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, as well as their long-term trends over 8 years, in the Fukushima Health Management Survey. The annual population-based Pregnancy and Birth Survey is conducted as part of the Fukushima Health Management Survey. The Fukushima Prefecture government launched it to assess the health conditions of pregnant women and their neonates after the GEJE. The self-reported questionnaire was sent to 115,976 pregnant women by mail from January 2012, with 58,344 women responding to the questionnaire (50.3% response rate). Pregnancy complications, such as gestational hypertension, respiratory diseases, and mental disorders, increased in some women who were pregnant at the time of the earthquake and immediately after the earthquake. However, the direct effects on newborns, such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and congenital anomalies, were not immediately clear after the earthquake. Although there were significant differences in the occurrence of preterm birth and low birth weight among the districts, there was no change in the occurrences of preterm birth, low birth weight, or anomalies in newborns in Fukushima Prefecture from the fiscal year 2011 to the fiscal year 2018. Therefore, the long-term effects of the post-disaster radiation accident on perinatal outcomes are considered to be very small.

AB  - Introduction: Due to their unique circumstances, pregnant women face a heightened risk of experiencing pregnancy complications during and after catastrophic events. This study aims to investigate the consequences of both natural and man-made disasters on pregnancy outcomes. Methods: This study is a systematic review. Searches were performed until May 31, 2024, in the electronic databases including Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus. Outcomes such as preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA), stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and pregnancy-related blood pressure complications were studied. Results: The search conducted in the databases yielded 3307 non-duplicate records. After reading the abstracts, 3204 articles were excluded based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full texts of 103 article were obtained. However, upon reading the full texts of articles, 13 of them did not meet the inclusion criteria for the study. Consequently, 90 articles were ultimately included. Conclusions: Natural and man-made disasters exert significant influence on adverse pregnancy outcomes. While it is impossible to prevent the incidence of natural disasters and often man-made disasters occur abruptly, the negative consequences of disasters, particularly natural ones, can be mitigated by enhancing prenatal care and avoiding detrimental elements such as smoking and alcohol.

AB  - BackgroundEvidence for the association between earthquakes and adverse perinatal outcomes is limited.ObjectivesTo evaluate the association between earthquakes and perinatal outcomes including preterm birth and low birth weight.Search StrategyWe searched studies using MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Platform Search Portal, and on February 9, 2023.Selection CriteriaWe included before-and-after studies that evaluated the associations between earthquakes and perinatal outcomes in women living in affected areas.Data Collection and AnalysisTwo independent reviewers extracted data. We calculated the pooled odds ratio (OR) with the random-effects model. We analyzed outcomes in subgroups of Asians and others. We evaluated the certainty of evidence with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.Main ResultsWe included 2 607 405 women in 13 studies. Earthquakes may not increase preterm birth (nine studies, 1 761 760 participants: OR 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-1.24, low certainty of evidence) or low birth weight (seven studies, 1 753 891 participants: OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.94-1.28, low certainty of evidence). Subgroup analyses showed that earthquakes may be associated with an increase of preterm birth among populations in Asia (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.07-1.95), but this was not evident in others (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83-1.05).ConclusionsPerinatal outcomes might not change after earthquakes. Further research on the association between earthquakes and perinatal outcomes, combined with an assessment of the characteristics of the region, is needed.
   Preterm birth and low birth weight might not change after earthquakes. However, earthquakes may be associated with an increase of preterm birth in Asia.

AB  - Information regarding the longitudinal effects of natural/environmental disasters on obstetrics outcomes is limited. This study aimed to analyze the longitudinal changes in obstetrics outcomes over 8 years after the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima power plant accident. We used data from the first 8 years of the Pregnancy and Birth Survey by the Fukushima prefectural government, launched in 2011. We compared data on obstetrics outcomes by year and divided Fukushima Prefecture into six districts based on administrative districts. Longitudinal changes in the occurrence of preterm birth before 37 gestational weeks, low birth weight, and anomalies in newborns were accessed using the Mantel-Haenszel test for trends in all six districts. Overall, 57,537 participants were included. In 8 years, maternal age, conception rate after sterility treatment, and cesarean section delivery incidence increased. Although significant differences were observed in preterm birth and low birth weight occurrence among districts, there was no significant trend in the occurrence of preterm birth, low birth weight, and anomalies in newborns in all six districts of Fukushima Prefecture. The Great East Japan Earthquake and Fukushima power plant accident were associated with increased cesarean section delivery incidence but had no significant adverse effects on obstetrics outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature on associations between climate drivers and health outcomes among pregnant people. This review fills a gap by synthesizing evidence for a clinician audience. DATA SOURCES: Systematic scoping review of articles published in PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov from January 2010 through December 2023. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Empirical studies published in English-language peer-reviewed journals, assessing associations between select climate drivers and adverse maternal and birth outcomes. The review included studies examining heat, storms, sea level rise, flooding, drought, wildfires, and other climate-related factors. Health outcomes included preterm birth, low birthweight, small for gestational age, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, miscarriage/stillbirth and maternal mortality. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: The scoping review protocol was registered with the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202410004, January 3, 2024) and conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Data were extracted by 2 authors; quality and risk of bias was assessed independently. RESULTS: Total of 966 references were screened; 16.35% (k=158) met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies (146/158; 92.4%) documented statistically significant and clinically meaningful associations between climate drivers and adverse perinatal health outcomes, including risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, and stillbirth as well as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, miscarriage, and maternal death. Among the most durable findings: extreme heat exposure in early and late pregnancy were associated with increased risk of preterm birth and stillbirth. Driven in part by large (often population-based) studies and objective outcomes from surveillance data or medical record reviews, studies in this scoping review were evaluated as high quality (scoring 7-9 on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale). Risk of bias was generally low. CONCLUSIONS: Climate drivers are consistently associated with adverse health outcomes for pregnant people. Continuing education for clinicians, and clinician-patient communications should be expanded to address risks of climate change and extreme weather exposure, especially risks of extreme heat in late-pregnancy. Results from this review should inform multilevel interventions to address adverse health effects of climate during pregnancy as well as practice advisories, protocols, checklists, and clinical guidelines in obstetrics.

AB  - Adverse infant outcomes often rise in the aftermath of disaster, but few studies have assessed the effects of disaster on maternal health. 1091 southern Louisiana women were interviewed about their pregnancy history, including pregnancy complications. Associations between oil spill exposures and gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, and nausea/vomiting were assessed for all reported pregnancies. 631 women had a pregnancy both before and after the oil spill. Generalized estimating equations (logistic regression) with adjustment for confounders were used. To assess possible unmeasured confounding, instead of considering oil spill exposure as a time-varying exposure, women were defined as oil spill-exposed or not. If oil spill-exposed women were equally prone to complications in pregnancies that occurred prior to the oil spill as after it, it was considered that any associations were likely due to selection or reporting issues. Women who reported oil spill exposure, particularly loss of use of the coast, were more likely to report gestational diabetes; however, the level of association was similar for pregnancies before and after the spill (p for interaction > 0.10 and odds ratios (ORs) for pregnancies prior to the spill > than those after the spill). No associations were found between oil spill exposure and hypertensive disorders. This analysis does not suggest an increased risk of pregnancy complications associated with exposure to the oil spill; however, future studies should assess exposure and outcomes prospectively and clinically instead of relying on self-report.

AB  - Objective: To appraise and analyze published research on the relationships among hurricane exposure and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Data Sources: A literature search was conducted in four electronic databases: CINAHL Plus, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science. The following search terms were used: "cyclonic storms," "cesarean section," "premature birth," "fetal mortality," "low birth weight," "infant mortality," "pregnancy complications," and "pregnancy outcome." Study Selection: Documents were included if they were peer-reviewed, full-text articles or government documents published in English through February 2020 that focused on the associations among exposure to hurricanes and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. The initial search yielded 211 articles, and one article was identified through a hand search. After 48 duplicates were removed, we screened the titles and abstracts of 164 articles. We conducted a full-text review of 57 articles, and 19 articles were included in the integrative review. Data Extraction: We extracted data from the full text of each article into a standardized table with the following headings: author, year of publication, location, hurricane and year, population studied, study design, outcomes, data source, and results. Data Synthesis: We analyzed study findings based on the outcomes of pregnancy complications, preterm birth, cesarean birth, labor and birth complications, low birth weight, abnormal newborn conditions, and fetal mortality. We synthesized data in a narrative format, and the synthesis indicated that hurricane exposure was frequently associated with pregnancy complications, preterm birth, low birth weight, cesarean birth, and abnormal newborn conditions. However, these associations were not always consistent. Extant research is limited by inconsistency among study designs and the type of hurricane exposure. Conclusion: Interdisciplinary teams that include nurses, midwives, obstetricians and gynecologists, and other health care professionals should ensure that hurricane preparedness and response efforts specifically address the needs of pregnant women to mitigate adverse outcomes.

AB  - Descriptive observational studies showed upward jumps in secular European perinatal mortality trends after Chernobyl. The question arises whether the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident entailed similar phenomena in Japan. For 47 prefectures representing 15.2 million births from 2001 to 2014, the Japanese government provides monthly statistics on 69,171 cases of perinatal death of the fetus or the newborn after 22 weeks of pregnancy to 7 days after birth. Employing change-point methodology for detecting alterations in longitudinal data, we analyzed time trends in perinatal mortality in the Japanese prefectures stratified by exposure to estimate and test potential increases in perinatal death proportions after Fukushima possibly associated with the earthquake, the tsunami, or the estimated radiation exposure. Areas with moderate to high levels of radiation were compared with less exposed and unaffected areas, as were highly contaminated areas hit versus untroubled by the earthquake and the tsunami. Ten months after the earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident, perinatal mortality in 6 severely contaminated prefectures jumped up from January 2012 onward: jump odds ratio 1.156; 95% confidence interval (1.061, 1.259), P-value 0.0009. There were slight increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. In severely contaminated areas, the increases of perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima were essentially independent of the numbers of dead and missing due to the earthquake and the tsunami. Perinatal mortality in areas contaminated with radioactive substances started to increase 10 months after the nuclear accident relative to the prevailing and stable secular downward trend. These results are consistent with findings in Europe after Chernobyl. Since observational studies as the one presented here may suggest but cannot prove causality because of unknown and uncontrolled factors or confounders, intensified research in various scientific disciplines is urgently needed to better qualify and quantify the association of natural and artificial environmental radiation with detrimental genetic health effects at the population level.

AB  - Increasing coastal populations and storm intensity may lead to more adverse health effects from tropical storms and hurricanes. Exposure during pregnancy can influence birth outcomes through mechanisms related to healthcare, infrastructure disruption, stress, nutrition, and injury. However, accurate estimation of health effects may be limited by nonspecific exposure definitions that create potential misclassification. The two predominant hurricane exposure assignments are (1) the county of a FEMA presidential disaster declaration; and (2) the specified area within a storm track. The authors propose a third method: meteorological severity of wind speed. Based on the Saffir-Simpson categories, wind speed was examined through binary and quartile comparisons. All three methods of exposure classification were compared by examining the associations with county-level preterm birth and low-birth-weight rates among Florida women who were pregnant during the 2004 hurricane season. The county-level environmental quality index developed by the EPA was used to control for county-level environmental factors. Although the models yielded unexpected negative results and insignificant rate differences, a descriptive and mapping analysis of the exposure methods showed clear heterogeneity of county exposure.

AB  - Natural disasters have generally been associated with an increase in adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth (PTB) and low birthweight (LBW) - two key markers of infant health that are predictive of infant mortality and life-long medical disabilities. However, there is considerable inconsistency between studies which makes it difficult to inform policy on pregnancy during and after natural disasters. In this study, we identify risk factors for pregnant women by undertaking the first meta-analysis on this topic, synthesising data from 42 studies with over 24 million participants. We also perform sub-group analysis on disaster type, a country's economic development, and trimester of exposure, addressing associations that can often not be examined in single studies. We found natural disasters to be associated with increased odds of both LBW (OR = 1.063) and PTB (OR = 1.075), with the largest effects seen from exposure in low Human Development Index countries (LBW: OR = 1.130; PTB: OR = 1.315), in first trimester (LBW: OR = 1.079; PTB: OR = 1.153), and following earthquake exposure for PTB (OR = 1.154). Our findings highlight the importance of directing disaster recovery efforts towards these vulnerable groups, to minimise the impacts on infant health following natural disasters.

AB  - Objectives: This study was aimed to analyze post-disaster birth outcomes in coastal and inland regions of Miyagi Prefecture, Japan.
   Methods: Primary data sets were compiled from birth records of obstetric facilities and 12,808 patients were analyzed for baseline birth outcomes by region. Regional risk analysis of the low-birth-weight rate and premature birth rate were conducted using multi-level logistic regression analysis.
   Results: From overall baseline birth outcomes, a preterm birth rate was 4.6% and low-birth-weight rate was 8.8%. Regional analysis revealed that a preterm birth rate was 3.2% (coastal) and 5.0% (inland), respectively, and the rate of low birth weight was 6.5% in the coastal and 8.5% in the inland region. In the risk analysis of low-birth-weight rate and preterm birth rate, the risk in the coastal region could not be considered any higher than in the inland region (adjusted odds ratio 0.91 [0.73-1.14] and 0.85 [0.46-1.59], respectively).
   Conclusions: The incidence of preterm birth and low birth weight were not adversely affected by the disaster. Early transfer and intensive medical intervention may have led to those findings. Further survey will be necessary to determine the long-term effects in both mothers and children.

AB  - Background: Epidemiological evidence on the association between wildfire-specific fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its carbonaceous components with perinatal outcomes is limited. We aimed to examine the short-term effects of wildfire-specific PM2.5 and its carbonaceous components on perinatal outcomes. Methods: A multicentre cohort of 9743 singleton births during the wildfire seasons from 1 September 2009 to 31 December 2015 across six cities in New South Wales, Australia were linked with daily wildfire-specific PM2.5 and carbonaceous components (organic carbon and black carbon). Adjusted distributed lag Cox regression models with spatial clustering were performed to estimate daily and cumulative adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) during the last four gestational weeks for preterm birth, stillbirth, nonvertex presentation, low 5-min Apgar score, special care nursery/neonatal intensive care unit (SCN/NICU) admission, and caesarean section. Results: Daily aHRs per 10 mu g/m(3) PM2.5 showed nearly inverted 'U'-shaped positive associations and daily cumulative aHRs that increased with increasing duration of the exposures. The aHRs for lag 0-6 days were 1.17 (95 % CI: 1.04, 1.32) for preterm birth, 1.40 (95 % CI: 1.11, 1.78) for stillbirth, 1.20 (95 % CI: 1.08, 1.33) for nonvertex presentation, 1.12 (95 % CI: 0.93, 1.35) for low 5-min Apgar score, 0.99 (95 % CI: 0.83, 1.19) for SNC/NICU admission, and 1.01 (95 % CI: 0.94, 1.08) for caesarean section. Organic carbon and black carbon components for lag 0-6 days showed positive associations. The highest component-specific aHRs were 1.09 (95 % CI: 1.03, 1.15) and 4.57 (95 % CI: 1.96, 10.68) for stillbirth per 1 mu g/m(3) organic carbon and black carbon, respectively. The subgroups identified as most vulnerable were female births, births to mothers with low socioeconomic status, and births to mothers with high biothermal exposure. Conclusions: Positive associations of short-term wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure and its carbonaceous components with adverse perinatal outcomes suggest that policies to reduce exposure would benefit public health.

AB  - Using National Vital Statistics Birth and Fetal Death Data from 1995 to 2020 linked to county-level information on wildfires, we use variation in wildfire timing to examine how effects of wildfire exposure on infant health vary by maternal education. Results indicate that wildfire exposure increases the likelihood of low birth weight and fetal death, but effects vary by both trimester and maternal education. Mediation analyses suggest the variation by maternal education reflects selective survival and unequal sensitivity, rather than differential parental response to wildfires. In addition, mediation analyses suggest that maternal behaviors explain a greater share of the relationship between wildfire exposure and infant health than air quality. Wildfires may therefore reduce infant health through stress.

AB  - Background: Exposure to wildfire smoke has been linked with a range of health outcomes. However, to date, evidence is limited for the association between wildfire-specific PM2.5, a primary emission of wildfire smoke, and adverse birth outcomes.Objective: We aimed to estimate the risk and burden of preterm birth/term low birth weight, associated with maternal exposure to wildfire-specific PM2.5.Methods: A total of 330,884 birth records with maternal information were collected from the New South Wales Australia from 2015 to 2019, covering 523 residential communities. Daily wildfire-specific PM2.5 at a 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees (approximate to 25 km x 25 km) resolution was estimated by a machine learning method combining 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and reanalysis meteorological data. Cox proportional hazards models were implemented to evaluate the association between wildfire-specific PM2.5 and preterm birth/term low birth weight. Number and fraction of preterm birth/term low birth weight attributable to wildfire-specific PM2.5 during pregnancy were calculated.Results: Per one interquartile-range rise in wildfire-specific PM2.5 was found to be associated with 6.9% (HR: 1.069, 95% CI: 1.058-1.081) increased risk of preterm birth and 3.6% (HR: 1.036, 95% CI: 1.014-1.058) higher risk of term low birth weight. The most susceptible gestational window was the 2nd trimester for preterm birth whereas the 1st for term low birth weight. We estimated that 14.30% preterm births and 8.04% term low birth weight cases were attributable to maternal exposure to wildfire-specific PM2.5 during the whole pregnancy. Male infants and mothers aged >= 40, experiencing temperature extremes or living in the inner region, and concepted during spring had higher risks of preterm birth/term low birth weight associated with wildfire-specific PM2.5. Comparatively, mothers with advanced age have a higher risk of preterm birth while younger mothers were more likely to deliver term newborns with low birth weight, when being exposed to wildfire-specific PM2.5. Pregnancy - induced hypertension enhanced the risk of preterm birth associated with wildfire-specific PM2.5.Conclusions: This study strengthened robust evidence on the enhanced risk of preterm birth/term low birth weight associated with maternal exposure to wildfire-specific PM2.5. In light of higher frequency and intensity of wildfire occurrences globally, more special attention should be paid to pregnant women by policy makers.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewTo examine epidemiologic concepts related to research conducted on reproductive health after disaster, summarize the current state of the literature on how disaster affects reproductive health, and report on interventions to mitigate disaster outcomes.Recent FindingsMany disaster epidemiologic studies of pregnancy rely on vital statistics. Issues like timeliness of research, migration of affected communities, and convenience sampling are important to consider in research design and interpretation. The few interventions in pregnant populations after disaster focus on mental health, with mixed results.SummaryDisaster research intrinsically has challenges due to the disruption that disasters pose to communities. Disasters' effects on fertility and infant outcomes like preterm birth and low birthweight have been well-studied, generally indicating negative effects. Research gaps exist relative to hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, and miscarriage. Interventions centered around preventing negative reproductive health outcomes in post-disaster settings are few.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to examine birth outcomes in areas affected by Hurricane Michael. Methods: Vital statistics data of 2017-2019 were obtained from the state of Florida. Births occurring in the year before and after the date of Hurricane Michael (October 7, 2018) were used. Florida counties were divided into 3 categories reflecting extent of impact from Hurricane Michael. Birth outcomes including incidence of preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and small for gestational age (SGA) were also compared before and after Hurricane Michael. Spontaneous and indicated PTBs were distinguished based on previously published algorithms. Multiple regression was used to control for potential confounders. Results: Both LBW (aRR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.32) and SGA (aRR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.21) were higher in the year after Michael than the year before in the most-affected area; a similar effect was not seen in other areas. A stronger effect was seen for exposure in the first trimester or in the 2 months after Michael than in the second or third trimester. Conclusion: Consistent with many previous studies, this study of Hurricane Michael found an effect on fetal growth.

AB  - This study looks at the impact of exposure to natural disasters during pregnancy on the educational outcomes of North Carolina children at the third grade level. A broad literature relates negative birth outcomes to poor educational performance, and a number of recent studies have examined the effect of prenatal exposure to natural disasters on birth outcomes. This study takes the next step by considering how prenatal exposure affects later outcomes. Combining North Carolina administrative data on births and school performance with disaster declarations from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) allows for the identification of children who were exposed to disasters during prenatal development. These children are compared with other children born in the same county who were not exposed to disasters while in utero. Regression results suggest that children exposed to hurricanes prenatally have lower scores on third grade standardized tests in math and reading. Those exposed to flooding or tornadoes also have somewhat lower math scores. Additionally, results suggest that these negative effects are more concentrated among children in disadvantaged subgroups, especially children born to black mothers. However, no evidence exists that these effects are mediated by common measures of birth outcomes, including birth weight and gestational age.

AB  - Objectives: Pregnant women are vulnerable to the health consequences of earthquakes, experiencing stress and limited access to healthcare. Despite the widespread impact of these events, knowledge about their effects on pregnancy outcomes is scarce and inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the available evidence, estimate the overall effect, and identify key research gaps about earthquake on pregnant women. Study Design: A comprehensive search of English-language peer-reviewed articles was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection. Various combinations of keywords related to earthquakes and pregnancy outcomes were used. Studies comparing quantitative data on pregnancy outcomes between earthquake-affected and unaffected pregnant women were included. Random and fixed-effects models were used to estimate the pooled effect size. Results: The meta-analysis revealed no significant difference in preterm delivery rates (OR: 1.18; 95 % CI: 0.94-1.47; I2 = 75 %; five studies, 26,365 women) and low birth weight (LBW) infant delivery rates (OR: 1.19; 95 % CI: 0.83-1.71; I2 = 72 %; three studies, 16,127 women) between the earthquake-affected and control groups. However, a statistically significant increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants was observed in the earthquake-affected group (OR: 1.25; 95 % CI: 1.08-1.43; I2 = 0 %; two studies, 10,238 women). Data on miscarriage and stillbirth rates were not suitable for meta-analysis. Conclusions: Limited evidence suggests that exposure to earthquakes may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm the increased risk of SGA in the affected population and to inform disaster management plans by enhancing our understanding of the adversities associated with earthquake exposure through more comprehensive epidemiologic research.

AB  - In 2010 the Gulf Coast experienced the largest oil spill affecting U.S. waters in history. Evaporating crude oil and dispersant chemicals can cause major health problems. This paper examines the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on air quality and infant health outcomes. Using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) AirData, vital statistics data from National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and a difference-in-difference methodology, we find that the oil spill of 2010 increased concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO in affected coastal counties, increased incidence of low birth weight (<2500 g) and premature born infants (<37 weeks of gestation). Heterogeneity effects reveal more pronounced adverse infant health outcomes for black, Hispanic, less educated, unmarried, and younger mothers. Results are robust to a wide range of controls and robustness checks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundMigration due to environmental factors is an international crisis affecting many nations globally. Pregnant people are a vulnerable subgroup of migrants.AimThis article explores the potential effects of environmental migration on pregnancy and aims to draw attention to this rising concern.MethodsBased on the study aim, a semi-structured literature review was performed. The following databases were searched: MEDLine (PubMed) and Google Scholar. The search was originally conducted on 31st January 2021 and repeated on 22nd September 2022.ResultsPregnant migrants are at increased risk of mental health disorders, congenital anomalies, preterm birth, and maternal mortality. Pregnancies exposed to natural disasters are at risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, and mental health morbidity. Along with the health risks, there are additional complex social factors affecting healthcare engagement in this population.ConclusionMaternity healthcare providers are likely to provide care for environmental migrants over the coming years. Environmental disasters and migration as individual factors have complex effects on perinatal health, and environmental migrants may be at risk of specific perinatal complications. Obstetricians and maternity healthcare workers should be aware of these challenges and appreciate the individualised and specialised care that these patients require.

AB  - Background
   In June 2013, the city of Calgary, Alberta and surrounding areas sustained significant flooding which resulted in large scale evacuations and closure of businesses and schools. Floods can increase stress which may negatively impact perinatal outcomes and mental health, but previous research is inconsistent. The objectives of this study are to examine the impact of the flood on pregnancy health, birth outcomes and postpartum mental health.
   Methods
   Linked administrative data from the province of Alberta were used. Outcomes included preterm birth, small for gestational age, a new diagnoses of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, and a diagnosis of, or drug prescription for, depression or anxiety. Data were analyzed using a quasi-experimental difference in difference design, comparing flooded and non-flooded areas and in affected and unaffected time periods. Multivariable log binomial regression models were used to estimate risk ratios, adjusted for maternal age. Marginal probabilities for the difference in difference term were used to show the potential effect of the flood.
   Results
   Participants included 18,266 nulliparous women for the pregnancy outcomes, and 26,956 women with infants for the mental health analysis. There were no effects for preterm birth (DID 0.00, CI: -0.02, 0.02), small for gestational age (DID 0.00, CI: -0.02, 0.02), or new cases of preeclampsia (DID 0.00, CI: -0.01, 0.01). There was a small increase in new cases of gestational hypertension (DID 0.02, CI: 0.01, 0.03) in flood affected areas. There were no differences in postpartum anxiety or depression prescriptions or diagnoses.
   Conclusion
   The Calgary 2013 flood was associated with a minor increase in gestational hypertension and not other health outcomes. Universal prenatal care and magnitude of the disaster may have minimized impacts of the flood on pregnant women.

AB  - Understanding factors that influence risk for mental health and substance use disorders is critical to improve population health and reduce social costs imposed by these disorders. We examine the impact of experiencing a natural disaster a serious fire, tornado, flood, earthquake, or hurricane by age five on adult mental health and substance use disorders. The analysis uses data from the 2004 to 2005 National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions. The analysis sample includes 27,129 individuals ages 21-64 years. We also exploit information on parenting strategies to study how parents respond to natural disasters encountered by their children. We find that experiencing one or more of these natural disasters by age five increases the risk of mental health disorders in adulthood, particularly anxiety disorders, but not substance use disorders. Parents alter some, but not all, of their parenting strategies following a natural disaster experienced by their children. It is important to provide support, for example through counseling services and financial assistance, to families and children exposed to natural disasters to mitigate future mental health and substance use problems attributable to such exposure.

AB  - In the southwestern United States, the frequency of summer wildfires has elevated ambient PM2.5 concentrations and rates of adverse birth outcomes. Notably, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) constitute a significant determinant associated with maternal mortality and adverse birth outcomes. Despite the accumulating body of evidence, scant research has delved into the correlation between chemical components of wildfire PM2.5 and the risk of HDP. Derived from data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics, singleton births from >2.68 million pregnant women were selected across 8 states (Arizona, AZ; California, CA, Idaho, ID, Montana, MT; Nevada, NV; Oregon, OR; Utah, UT, and Wyoming, WY) in the southwestern US from 2001 to 2004. A spatiotemporal model and a Goddard Earth Observing System chemical transport model were employed to forecast daily concentrations of total and wildfire PM2.5-derived exposure. Various modeling techniques including unadjusted analyses, covariate-adjusted models, propensity-score matching, and double robust typical logit models were applied to assess the relationship between wildfire PM2.5 exposure and gestational hypertension and eclampsia. Exposure to fire PM2.5, fire-sourced black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) were associated with an augmented risk of gestational hypertension (ORPM2.5 = 1.125, 95 % CI: 1.109,1.141; ORBC = 1.247, 95 % CI: 1.214,1.281; OROC = 1.153, 95 % CI: 1.132, 1.174) and eclampsia (ORPM2.5 = 1.217, 95 % CI: 1.145,1.293; ORBC = 1.458, 95 % CI: 1.291,1.646; OROC = 1.309, 95 % CI: 1.208,1.418) during the pregnancy exposure window with the strongest effect. The associations were stronger that the observed effects of ambient PM2.5 in which the sources primarily came from urban emissions. Social vulnerability index (SVI), education years, pre-pregnancy diabetes, and hypertension acted as effect modifiers. Gestational exposure to wildfire PM2.5 and specific chemical components (BC and OC) increased gestational hypertension and eclampsia risk in the southwestern United States.

AB  - Purpose of review The consequences of climate change, including heat and extreme weather events impact kidney function in adults and children. The impacts of climate change on kidney development during gestation and thereby on kidney function later in life have been poorly described. Clinical evidence is summarized to highlight possible associations between climate change and nephron mass.
   Recent findings Pregnant women are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, being less able to thermoregulate, more sensitive to the effects of dehydration, and more susceptible to infections. Exposure to heat, wildfire smoke, drought, floods and climate-related infections are associated with low birth weight, preterm birth and preeclampsia. These factors are associated with reduced nephron numbers, kidney dysfunction and higher blood pressures in offspring in later life. Exposure to air pollution is associated with higher blood pressures in children and has variable effects on estimated glomerular filtration rate.
   Summary Climate change has important impacts on pregnant women and their unborn children. Being born too small or too soon is associated with life-time risk of kidney disease. Climate change may therefore have a dual effect of impacting fetal kidney development and contributing to cumulative postnatal kidney injury. The impact on population kidney health of future generations may be significant.

AB  - Background: Previous studies link maternal blood lead (Pb) levels and pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders.
   Objective: Assess the relationship between neighborhood soil Pb and maternal eclampsia risk.
   Methods: Zip code summarized high density soil survey data of New Orleans collected before and after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (HKR) were merged with pregnancy outcome data on 75,501 mothers from the Louisiana office of public health. Cross-sectional logistic regression analyses are performed testing the association between pre-HKR accumulation of Pb in soils in thirty-two neighborhoods and eclampsia risk. Then we examine whether measured declines in soil Pb following the flooding of the city resulted in corresponding reductions of eclampsia risk.
   Results: Cross-sectional analyses show that a one standard deviation increase in soil Pb increases the odds of eclampsia by a factor of 1.48 (95% CI: 131, 1.66). Mothers in zip code areas with soil Pb > 333 mg/kg were 4.00 (95% CI: 3.00, 535) times more likely to experience eclampsia than mothers residing in neighborhoods with soil Pb < 50 mg/kg. Difference-in-differences analyses capturing the exogenous reduction in soil Pb following the 2005 flooding of New Orleans indicate that mothers residing in zip codes experiencing decrease in soil Pb (-387.9 to -33.6 mg/kg) experienced a significant decline in eclampsia risk (OR=0.619; 95% CI: 0397, 0.963).
   Conclusions: Mothers residing in neighborhoods with high accumulation of Pb in soils are at heightened risk of experiencing eclampsia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - ObjectiveDespite emerging evidence of the detrimental effects of natural disasters on maternal and child health, little is known about exposure to tornadoes during the prenatal period and its impact on birth outcomes. We examined the relationship between prenatal exposure to the spring 2011 tornado outbreak in Alabama and Joplin (Missouri) and adverse birth outcomes.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional cohort study using the 2010-2012 linked infant births and deaths data set from the National Center for Health Statistics for tornado-affected counties in Alabama (n=126,453) and Missouri (Joplin, n=6,897). Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate associations between prenatal exposure to tornadoes and birth outcomes.ResultsPrenatal exposure to the tornado incidents did not influence birth weight outcomes. Women exposed to Alabama tornadoes were less likely to have a preterm birth compared to unexposed mothers (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.91, 0.96). Preterm births among Joplin-tornado exposed mothers were slightly higher (13%) compared with unexposed mothers (11.2%). Exposed mothers from Joplin were also more likely to have a cesarean section compared to their counterparts (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.26).ConclusionsWe found no association between tornado exposure and adverse birth weight and infant mortality rates. Our findings suggest that prenatal exposure can amplify the odds for a cesarean section. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2019;13:279-286)

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the potential for adverse health outcomes among infants born to US Coast Guard (USCG) responders to the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill disaster. MethodsDepartment of Defense Birth and Infant Health Research programme data identified a cohort of singleton infants born 2010-2011 to USCG personnel in the DWH Oil Spill Coast Guard Cohort study. Infants were included if their military parent ('sponsor') responded to the oil spill during a selected reproductive exposure window (ie, 3 months preconception for male sponsors and periconception through pregnancy for female sponsors), or if their sponsor was a non-responder. chi(2) tests and multivariable log-binomial regression were used to compare the demographic and health characteristics of infants born to spill responders and non-responders. ResultsOverall, 1974 infants with a male sponsor (n=182 responder, n=1792 non-responder) and 628 infants with a female sponsor (n=35 responder, n=593 non-responder) in the DWH Oil Spill Coast Guard Cohort were identified. Health outcomes were similar among the offspring of male responders and non-responders. The frequency of any poor live birth outcome (ie, low birth weight, preterm birth or birth defect) was higher among infants born to female responders (17.1%, n=6) than non-responders (8.9%, n=53); the maternal age-adjusted association was suggestively elevated (risk ratio 1.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 4.16). ConclusionInfant health outcomes were comparable between the offspring of male USCG oil spill responders and non-responders. Findings were limited by the small number of infants identified, particularly among female responders, and should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - Objectives. To review the trends in pregnancy outcomes after Hurricane Katrina and assess effects of the disaster on research and public health related to pregnant women.
   Methods. We reexamined the 2004-2006 vital statistics data from Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, assessing what the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in the population would have been under varying risk scenarios.
   Results. We saw a reduction in number of births as well as in low birth weight and preterm birth. If the number of births had stayed constant and the relative higher risk in the "missing" births had been between 17% and 100%, the storm would have been associated with an increased risk instead of a decrease. Because the relative decline in births was larger inBlackwomen, thehigher risk in the "missing" births required tocreate a significant increase associated with the storm was generally not as great as for White women.
   Conclusions. Higher exposure to Katrina may have produced a reduction in births among high-risk women in the region rather than increasing adverse outcomes among those who did give birth.

AB  - Objectives: Wildfire air pollution is a growing concern on human health. The study aims to assess the associations between wildfire air pollution and pregnancy outcomes in the Southwestern United States. Study design: This was a retrospective cohort study. Methods: Birth records of 627,404 singleton deliveries in 2018 were obtained in eight states of the Southwestern United States and were linked to wildfire-sourced fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and their constituents (black carbon [BC] and organic carbon [OC]) during the entire gestational period. A doublerobust logistic regression model was used to assess the associations of wildfire-sourced PM2.5 exposures and preterm birth and term low birth weight, adjusting for non-fire-sourced PM2.5 exposure and individual- and area-level confounder variables. Results: Wildfire-sourced PM2.5 contributed on average 15% of the ambient total PM2.5 concentrations. For preterm birth, the strongest association was observed in the second trimester (odds ratio [OR]: 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.07 for PM2.5; 1.06, 95% CI: 1.05-1.07 for BC; 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03-1.05 for OC, per interquartile range increment of exposure), with higher risks identified among non-smokers or those with low socio-economic status. For term low birth weight, the associations with wildfiresourced PM2.5 exposures were consistently elevated for all trimesters except for the exposure averaged over the entire gestational period. Overall, the associations between wildfire-sourced PM2.5 and pregnancy outcomes were stronger than those with total PM2.5. Conclusions: Wildfire-sourced PM2.5 and its constituents are linked to higher risks of preterm birth and term low birth weight among a significant US population than the effects of ambient total PM2.5.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether the February 27th earthquake exposition was associated to adverse perinatal outcomes in Chilean pregnant women. Methods: We analyzed all deliveries occurred in 2009 (n = 3,609) and 2010 (n = 3,279) in a reference hospital in the area of the earthquake. Furthermore, we investigated pregnant women who gave birth between March 1st and December 31st 2010 (n = 2,553) and we classified them according to timing of exposition. Results: We found a 9% reduction in birth rate, but an increase in the rate of early preterm deliveries (<34 weeks), premature rupture of membranes (PROM), macrosomia, small for gestational age, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) after the earthquake, in contrast to the previous year. Women exposed to the earthquake during her first trimester delivered smaller newborns (3,340 +/- 712 g v/s 3,426 +/- 576 g respectively, p = 0.007) and were more likely diagnosed with early preterm delivery, preterm delivery (<37 weeks) and PROM but were less likely diagnosed with IUGR and late delivery (42 weeks, p < 0.05) compared to those exposed at third trimester. Accordingly, IUGR and preterm deliveries presented elevated healthcare costs. Conclusion: Natural disasters such as earthquakes are associated to adverse perinatal outcomes that impact negatively the entire maternal-neonatal healthcare system.

AB  - Background. The empirical literature on the effects of disaster on pregnancy and the postpartum period is limited. The objective of this review was to examine the existing evidence on the effect of disasters on perinatal health.
   Methods. A systematic review was conducted by searching electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cinahl, PsycInfo), including literature on disasters and pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital anomalies), mental health, and child development. A total of 110 articles were identified, but many published reports were anecdotes or recommendations rather than systematic studies. The final review included 49 peer-reviewed studies that met inclusion criteria.
   Results. Studies addressing the World Trade Center disaster of September 11 and other terrorist attacks, environmental/chemical disasters, and natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes were identified. Disasters of various types may reduce fetal growth in some women, although there does not appear to be an effect on gestational age at birth. Severity of exposure is the major predictor of mental health issues among pregnant and postpartum women. After a disaster, mental health of the mother may more strongly influence on child development than any direct effect of disaster-related prenatal stress.
   Conclusions. There is evidence that disaster impacts maternal mental health and some perinatal health outcomes, particular among highly exposed women. Future research should focus on understudied outcomes such as spontaneous abortion. Relief workers and clinicians should concentrate on the most exposed women, particularly with respect to mental health.
   Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists
   Learning Objectives: After completion of this educational activity, the obstetrician/gynecologist should be better able to compare and contrast the effects of different types of disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, chemical spills) on pregnant and postpartum women in order to prepare for patient care in the aftermath of such disasters; differentiate the birth outcomes likely to be affected by disaster, in order to identify patients likely to be at high risk; and assess the extent to which pregnant and postpartum women are a uniquely vulnerable population after disaster, to assist in organizing care under such circumstances.

AB  - Disasters and displacement increasingly affect and challenge urban settings. How do pregnant women fare in the aftermath of a major disaster? This paper investigates the effect of pregnancies in disaster situations. The study tests a hypothesis that pregnant women residing in hurricane-prone areas suffer higher health risks. The setting is Louisiana in the Gulf Coast, United States, a state that continually experiences hurricane impacts. The time period for the analysis is three years following the landfall of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. We analysed low birth weight and preterm deliveries before and after landfall, as a whole and by race. Findings support an association between hazards and health of a community and indicate that pregnant women in the affected area, irrespective of race, are more likely to experience preterm deliveries compared to pre-event births. Results suggest there is a negative health legacy impact in Louisiana as a result of hurricane landfall.

AB  - Using three statistical models (GLR, GEP, and GM), the effect of Hurricane Katrina on low birth weight and preterm delivery babies for African American women is examined in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. The study results indicate that risk factors associated with low birth weight and preterm delivery for American African women include unemployment and percent of mothers between the ages of 15-19. Among White women, ages 15-19, risk factors included poverty rate, median household income, and total birth rate. The GMs performed accurate predictions with increasing low birth weight and preterm delivery trends for African American women in the Gulf Coast states and other U.S. states, and decreasing low birth weight and preterm delivery trends for their White counterparts in the same state locations. Data presented between 2007-2010 show low birth weight and preterm delivery for White women as a decreasing tendency while birth outcomes for African American women exhibited a monotonically increasing trend. The empirical findings. suggest that health disriarities will continue to exist in the foreseeable future, if no. effective intervention is taken. The models identify risk factors that contribute to adverse birth outcomes and offer some insight into strategies and programs to address and ameliorate these effects.

AB  - Logistic regression and spatial analytic techniques are used to model fetal distress risk as a function of maternal exposure to Hurricane Andrew. First, monthly time series compare the proportion of infants born distressed in hurricane affected and unaffected areas. Second, resident births are analyzed in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, before, during, and after Hurricane Andrew. Third, resident births are analyzed in all Florida locales with 100,000 or more persons, comparing exposed and unexposed gravid females. Fourth, resident births are analyzed along Hurricane Andrew's path from southern Florida to northeast Mississippi. Results show that fetal distress risk increases significantly with maternal exposure to Hurricane Andrew in second and third trimesters, adjusting for known risk factors. Distress risk also correlates with the destructive path of Hurricane Andrew, with higher incidences of fetal distress found in areas of highest exposure intensity. Hurricane exposed African-American mothers were more likely to birth distressed infants. The policy implications of in utero costs of natural disaster exposure are discussed.

KW  - EXPOSURE
AB  - To evaluate whether pregnancies conceived via assisted reproductive technology and exposed to Hurricane Katrina (HK), one of the most destructive natural disasters in United States history, were more prone to adverse perinatal outcomes, miscarriages, or sex disparities compared with pregnancies established but not directly exposed to the natural disaster. Retrospective cohort study. Women 18 years and older undergoing fresh ART cycles that resulted in singleton pregnancies and entered in the SART CORS database from 2004 to 2008. Incidence of full-term and preterm delivery, miscarriage rate, infant weight at birth, and infant sex ratio. Total follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation dosage and number of oocytes retrieved. Between January 2004 and December 2008, a total of 451,848 fresh autologous IVF cycles were recorded in SART CORS, leading to 190,624 pregnancies and 129,499 live births. After controlling for potential confounders, our results demonstrate no association between HK exposure and overall preterm deliveries (< 37 weeks) in women with singleton pregnancies conceived after ART. Other perinatal outcomes such as rate of spontaneous abortion or infant weight at birth in the exposed and unexposed groups were also not associated with HK. A comparison of pre and post disaster sex ratios revealed fewer males were born after HK (51.0% vs. 49.4%), showing a trend of decreased male infant births that was least in part associated with HK (CI 0.81-1.01; p = 0.07). Exposure to HK did not appear to affect perinatal outcomes such as the rate of preterm delivery or the rate of spontaneous abortion. Extreme stress may be a factor that contributes to a reduced male to female secondary sex ratio.

AB  - Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS) is nationwide birth cohort study that was initiated in January 2011 to investigate the effect of environmental factors on children's health. Soon after the JECS started, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred on March 11, 2011, with subsequent nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, causing catastrophic damage in Fukushima Prefecture. After the disaster, JECS was relaunched to cover all areas in Fukushima Prefecture due to public concern. In this study, we used the results of individuals enrolled in JECS, who gave birth during 2011-2014 in Fukushima Prefecture, to elucidate pregnancy outcomes in Fukushima Prefecture. The study consisted of 12,804 maternal outcomes. We thus found that the prevalence rates of preterm birth < 37 weeks, low birth weight (LBW) < 2,500 g, and LBW < 1,500 g were 5.6%, 9.5%, and 0.8%, respectively; these rates are in accordance with the National Vital Statistics of 2014. The proportion of major anomaly among the newborns was 1.7%, the value of which was lower than other epidemiological studies. This study also found that severe obstetrics outcomes, such as hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and placental abruption, were most frequently seen among teenage mothers with low socioeconomic status. A prefecture-wide birth cohort study following a large-scale disaster may provide valuable information for obstetric care providers and residents to improve obstetric and perinatal care for pregnant women after a disaster.

AB  - Exposure to tropical cyclones during pregnancy can adversely influence neonatal and birth outcomes, contributing to low birth weight and preterm birth. These outcomes could be impacted by the disruption of healthcare and infrastructure, as well as stress and injury. Although research has focused on the impacts on neonatal health from extreme tropical events, little is known about the neonatal health impacts of moderate-intensity hurricanes or hurricanes that reduce intensity before landfall. The aim of this study is to 1) assess the causal association between hurricane exposure and the adverse birth outcomes of low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB) using a difference-in-difference analysis and 2) identify differences in spatial patterns for the adverse birth outcomes LBW and PTB pre- and post-Hurricane Isabel, a Category 2 storm that impacted North Carolina in 2003. The geospatial analysis included multiple buffers of 30, 60, and 100 km to define exposure and local spatial autocorrelation statistics. The results were predominantly insignificant, with some key exceptions. The difference-in-difference analysis found a statistically negative association between hurricane exposure and preterm birth, suggesting an unexpected reduction in preterm births post-storm. We found that exposure to Hurricane Isabel (2003) and LWB were statistically significant at the 30 and 100-km spatial buffers; exposure was also associated with a decrease in PTB at the 30 km buffer. We also examined differences in potential impacts by trimester and found a significant negative association during the second and third trimesters. Significant differences in the clustering of LBW and PTB before and after Isabel made landfall were also found, with new clusters of higher PTB and LBW forming along the storm track. Results from our study highlight the need for further analysis of neonatal and birth outcomes across different hurricane types and the need for spatial analysis to understand fine-scale heterogeneity in hurricane risk.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to investigate the effects of maternal exposure to external radiation on perinatal outcomes among women who experienced the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster (FDND) using the Fukushima Health Management Survey (FHMS).Methods: Data from the Pregnancy and Birth Survey and Basic Survey in the FHMS were combined to analyze external maternal radiation exposure following the FDND, and the relationship between radiation dose and perinatal outcomes was analyzed using binomial logistic regression analysis. Missing dose data were supplemented using multiple imputation.Results: A total of 6,875 individuals responded to the survey. Congenital anomalies occurred in 2.9% of patients, low birth weight (LBW) in 7.6%, small for gestation age (SGA; <10th percentile) in 8.9%, and preterm birth in 4.1%. The median maternal external radiation dose was 0.5 mSv (maximum, 5.2 mSv). Doses were classified as follows: <1 mSv (reference), 1 to <2 mSv, and >= 2 mSv. For congenital anomalies, the crude odds ratio for 1 to <2 mSv was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-1.17) (no participants with congenital anomaly were exposed to >= 2 mSv). At 1 to <2 mSv and >= 2 mSv, the respective adjusted odds ratios were 0.91 (95% CI, 0.71-1.18) and 1.21 (95% CI, 0.53-2.79) for LBW, 1.14 (95% CI, 0.92-1.42) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.30-2.37) for SGA, and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.65-1.29) and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.22-4.87) for preterm birth.Conclusion: External radiation dose due to the FDND was not associated with congenital anomalies, LBW, SGA, or preterm birth.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to examine the relationship between exposure to the 2010 Haiti earthquake and pregnancy wantedness, interpregnancy interval, and birth weight.
   Methods: From the nationally representative Haiti 2012 Demographic and Health Survey, information on "size of child at birth" (too small or not) was available for 7280 singleton births in the previous 5 years, whereas information on birth weight was available for 1607 births. Pregnancy wantedness, short (<1 year) interpregnancy interval, and maternal-reported birth weight were compared before and after the earthquake and by level of damage. Multiple logistic regression and linear regression analyses were conducted.
   Results: Post-earthquake births were less likely to be wanted and more likely to be born after a short interpregnancy interval. Earthquake exposure was associated with increased likelihood of a child being born too small: timing of birth (after earthquake vs. before earthquake, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-1.45), region (hardest-hit vs. rest of country; aOR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.14-1.80), and house damage (aOR: 1.27 95% CI: 1.02-1.58). Mean birth weight was 150 to 300 g lower in those exposed to the earthquake.
   Conclusions: Experience with the earthquake was associated with worse reproductive and birth outcomes, which underscores the need to provide reproductive health services as part of relief efforts.

AB  - Background: From November 2019 to January 2020, eastern Australia experienced the worst bushfires in recorded history. Two months later, Sydney and surrounds were placed into lockdown for six weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by ongoing restrictions. Many pregnant women at this time were exposed to both the bushfires and COVID-19 restrictions. Objective: To assess the impact of exposure to bushfires and pandemic restrictions on perinatal outcomes. Methods: The study included 60 054 pregnant women who gave birth between November 2017 and December 2020 in South Sydney. Exposure cohorts were based on conception and birthing dates: 1) bushfire late pregnancy, born before lockdown; 2) bushfires in early-mid pregnancy, born during lockdown or soon after; 3) conceived during bushfires, lockdown in second trimester; 4) conceived after bushfires, pregnancy during restrictions. Exposure cohorts were compared with pregnancies in the matching periods in the two years prior. Associations between exposure cohorts and gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, hypertension, stillbirth, mode of birth, birthweight, preterm birth and small for gestational age were assessed using generalised estimating equations, adjusting for covariates. Results: A decrease in low birth weight was observed for cohort 1 (aOR 0.81, 95%CI 0.69, 0.95). Conversely, cohort 2 showed an increase in low birth weight, and increases in prelabour rupture of membranes, and caesarean sections (aOR 1.18, 95%CI 1.03, 1.37; aOR 1.21, 95%CI 1.07, 1.37; aOR 1.10 (1.02, 1.18) respectively). Cohort 3 showed an increase in unplanned caesarean sections and high birth weight babies (aOR 1.15, 95%CI 1.04, 1.27 and aOR 1.16, 95%CI 1.02, 1.31 respectively), and a decrease in gestational diabetes mellitus was observed for both cohorts 3 and 4. Conclusion: Pregnancies exposed to both severe climate events and pandemic disruptions appear to have increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes beyond only experiencing one event, but further research is needed.

AB  - Background Perinatal mortality increased in contaminated prefectures after the Fukushima Daichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accidents in Japan in 2011. Elevated counts of surgeries for cryptorchidism and congenital heart malformations were observed throughout Japan from 2012 onward. The thyroid cancer detection rate (2011 to 2016) was associated with the dose-rate at the municipality level in the Fukushima prefecture. Since the birth weight is a simple and objective indicator for gestational development and pregnancy outcome, the question arises whether the annual birth weight distribution was distorted in a dose-rate-dependent manner across Japan after Fukushima. Methods The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare provides prefecture-specific annual counts for 26.158 million live births from 1995 to 2018, of which 2.366 million births (9.04%) with weights < 2500 g. Prefecture-specific spatiotemporal trends of the low birth weight proportions were analyzed. Logistic regression allowing for level-shifts from 2012 onward was employed to test whether those level-shifts were proportional to the prefecture-specific dose-rates derived from Cs-137 deposition in the 47 Japanese prefectures. Results The overall trend of the low birth weight prevalence (LBWp) in Japan discloses a jump in 2012 with a jump odds ratio (OR) 1.020, 95%-confidence interval (1.003,1.037),p-value 0.0246. A logistic regression of LBWp on the additional dose-rate after the FDNPP accidents adjusted for prefecture-specific spatiotemporal base-line trends yields an OR per mu Sv/h of 1.098 (1.058, 1.139),p-value < 0.0001. Further adjusting the logistic regression for the annual population size and physician density of the prefectures, as well as for the counts of the dead, the missing, and the evacuees due to earthquake and tsunami (as surrogate measures for medical infrastructure and stress) yields an OR per mu Sv/h of 1.109 (1.032, 1.191),p-value 0.0046. Conclusions This study shows increased low birth weight prevalence related to the Cs-137 deposition and the corresponding additional dose-rate in Japan from 2012 onward. Previous evidence suggesting compromised gestational development and pregnancy outcome under elevated environmental ionizing radiation exposure is corroborated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that maternal exposure to acute stress has a negative impact on the duration of pregnancy, and that this effect may vary by the time of exposure. It has also been proposed that stress exposure reduces the ratio of male-to-female births. To date, no study has jointly examined both outcomes, although they may be strongly related. Using population-level data with no selectivity, we jointly study the sex-specific effect of stress on the duration of pregnancy and the observed sex ratio among pregnant women exposed to a major earthquake in Chile.
   METHODS: In a quasi-experimental design, women exposed to the earthquake in different months of gestation were compared with women pregnant 1 year earlier. Estimates from a comparison group of pregnant women living in areas not affected by the earthquake were also examined to rule out confounding trends. Regression models were used to measure the impact of earthquake exposure on gestational age and preterm birth by sex across month of gestation. A counterfactual simulation was implemented to assess the effect of the earthquake on the secondary sex ratio accounting for the differential impact of stress on gestational age by sex.
   RESULTS: Earthquake exposure in Months 2 and 3 of gestation resulted in a significant decline in gestational age and increase in preterm delivery. Effects varied by sex, and were much larger for female than male pregnancies. Among females, the probability of preterm birth increased by 0.038 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.005, 0.072] in Month 2 and by 0.039 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.075) in Month 3. Comparable increases for males were insignificant at the conventional P < 0.05 level. After accounting for the sex-specific impact on gestational age, a decline in the male-to-female ratio in Month 3 of exposure was detected [-0.058 (95% CI: -0.113, -0.003)].
   CONCLUSIONS: Maternal exposure to an exogenous stressor early but not late in the pregnancy affects gestational age and the probability of preterm birth. This effect is much stronger in females than males. Stress exposure in early pregnancy may also contribute to a decline in the ratio of male-to-female live births in exposed cohorts.

AB  - Background. Little is known about the effects of natural disasters on pregnancy outcomes. We studied mental health and birth outcomes among women exposed to Hurricane Katrina. Methods: We collected data prospectively from a cohort of 301 women from New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Pregnant women were interviewed during pregnancy about their experiences during the hurricane, and whether they had experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or depression. High hurricane exposure was defined as having 3 or more of the 8 severe hurricane experiences, such as feeling that one's life was in danger, walking through floodwaters, or having a loved one die. Results: The frequency of low birth weight was higher in women with high hurricane exposure (14.0%) than women without high hurricane exposure (4.7%), with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.3; 95% confidence interval (0): 1.13-9.89; P < 0.01. The frequency of preterm birth was higher in women with high hurricane exposure (14.0%) than women without high hurricane exposure (6.3%), with aOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 0.82-6.38; P > 0.05. There were no significant differences in the frequency of low birth weight or preterm birth between women with PTSD or depression and women without PTSD or depression (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Women who had high hurricane exposure were at an increased risk of having low birth weight infants. Rather than a general exposure to disaster, exposure to specific severe disaster events and the intensity of the disaster experience may be better predictors of poor pregnancy outcomes. To prevent poor pregnancy outcomes during and after disasters, future disaster preparedness may need to include the planning of earlier evacuation of pregnant women to minimize their exposure to severe disaster events.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effects of displacement due to flooding during pregnancy on birth outcomes (infant birth weight and gestational age) and the moderating effect of perceived social support on the relationship between displacement and birth outcomes.
   Design: A descriptive, longitudinal study.
   Setting: A university-affiliated hospital in Pathum Thani, Thailand.
   Participants: Pregnant women (N = 175) in the third trimester that had uncomplicated pregnancies and no history of mental illness.
   Methods: During pregnancy, the participants completed standardized measurements of depression symptoms, perceived social support, and questionnaires concerning the effect of the flood. After giving birth, infant birth weight and gestational age at birth were retrieved from delivery records.
   Results: Seventy percent (n = 123) of the participants experienced displacement during the flood. The displaced women had a mean infant birth weight of 175 grams less than that of the nondisplaced women, t(173) = -2.38, p = .02, whereas infant gestational age was not different. Displacement and other variables explained approximately 8% of the variance in infant birth weight. The interaction term between displacement and perceived social support was statistically significant and additionally explained the variance in infant birth weight, F(6, 168) = 3.24, p = .005.
   Conclusion: Being displaced during pregnancy due to a natural disaster affected fetal growth rather than length of gestation. Health care providers should closely monitor maternal weight gain and fetal growth of pregnant women who experience displacement. Among the displaced women, social support was associated with higher infant birth weight; therefore, high levels of perceived social support may be protective for pregnant women who experience stressful events such as displacement from flooding.

AB  - Objective: To assess the impact of experiencing a major flood during pregnancy on fetal growth and length of gestation, and to consider how flood-related strains might contribute to these effects. Method: The Red River Pregnancy Project was a prospective study carried out for 3 months immediately after the historic 2009 crest of the Red River in Fargo, North Dakota. Pregnant community residents who were at least 18 years old with a singleton, intrauterine pregnancy participated in the study (N = 169). Analyses examined if birth weight and length of gestation were associated with residential distance from flooding and gestational age at time of the flood crest. Results: For pregnancies earlier in gestation during the crest (-1 SD = 12 weeks), birth weight decreased as distance from flooding decreased (-42.29 g/mi, p < .01). For pregnancies later in gestation at crest (+1 SD = 26 weeks), distance was not associated with birth weight (p > .10). Biparietal growth trajectories showed a decrease in growth after the crest of the flood but only for women early in pregnancy. However, various measures of flood related and general stress or strain did not explain these effects. Length of gestation was not associated with distance from or the timing of the flood. Conclusions: Pregnant women in the first trimester who experience a major flood near their homes are at risk of having lower birth weight neonates due to a reduction in fetal growth. The mechanisms of this effect deserve further attention in rapidly mounted investigations after disaster.

AB  - To examine how the recovery following Hurricane Katrina affected pregnancy outcomes.
   308 New Orleans area pregnant women were interviewed 5-7 years after Hurricane Katrina about their exposure to the disaster (danger, damage, and injury); current disruption; and perceptions of recovery. Birthweight, gestational age, birth length, and head circumference were examined in linear models, and low birthweight (< 2500 g) and preterm birth (< 37 weeks) in logistic models, with adjustment for confounders.
   Associations were found between experiencing damage during Katrina and birthweight (adjusted beta for high exposure = -158 g) and between injury and gestational age (adjusted beta = -0.5 days). Of the indicators of recovery experience, most consistently associated with worsened birth outcomes was worry that another hurricane would hit the region (adjusted beta for birthweight: -112 g, p = 0.08; gestational age: -3.2 days, p = 0.02; birth length: -0.65 cm, p = 0.06).
   Natural disaster may have long-term effects on pregnancy outcomes. Alternately, women who are most vulnerable to disaster may be also vulnerable to poor pregnancy outcome.

AB  - To examine whether reported exposure to the Gulf oil spill (2010) was related to reproductive reported miscarriage or infertility.
   1524 women aged 18-45 recruited through prenatal and Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) clinics, and community events were interviewed about their experience of the oil spill and reproductive history. 1434 women had information on outcomes of at least one pregnancy, and 633 on a pregnancy both before and after the spill. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the relationship between contact with oil and economic and social consequences of the spill with postponement of pregnancy, miscarriage, and infertility (time to pregnancy > 12 months or reported fertility issues), with adjustment for age, race, BMI, smoking, and socioeconomic status. Results were compared for pregnancies occurring prior to and after the oil spill.
   77 (5.1%) women reported postponing pregnancy due to the oil spill, which was more common in those with high contact with oil or overall high exposure (aOR 2.92, 95% CI 1.31-6.51). An increased risk of miscarriage was found with any exposure to the oil spill (aOR, 1.54, 95% CI 1.17-2.02). Fertility issues were more common in the overall most highly exposed women (aOR 1.88, 1.19-2.95), when the data were limited to those with pregnancies before and after. However, no particular aspect of oil spill exposure was strongly associated with the outcomes, and effects were almost as strong for pregnancies prior to the oil spill.
   The oil spill appears to have affected reproductive decision-making. The evidence is not strong that exposure to the oil spill was associated with miscarriage or infertility.

AB  - Background: Maternal wildfire exposure (e.g., smoke, stress) has been associated with poor birth outcomes with effects potentially mediated through air pollution and psychosocial stress. Despite the recent hike in the intensity and frequency of wildfires in some regions of the world, a critical appraisal of the evidence on the association between maternal wildfire exposure and adverse birth outcomes has not yet been undertaken. We conducted a systematic review that evaluated the scientific evidence on the association between wildfire exposure during pregnancy and the risk of adverse birth outcomes. Methods: Comprehensive searches in nine bibliographic databases were conducted from database inception up to June 2020. Observational epidemiological studies that evaluated associations between exposure to wildfire during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes were eligible for inclusion. Studies were assessed using the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP OHAT) risk of bias tool and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Screening of retrieved articles, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Study results were synthesized descriptively. Results: Eight epidemiological studies conducted in four countries and involving 1,702,252 births were included in the review. The exposure to wildfire during pregnancy was assessed in individual studies by measurement of PM2.5 (n = 2), PM10 (n = 1), Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aerosol index (n = 1), heat spots (n = 1), and by proximity of maternal residence to wildfire-affected areas (n = 3). There is some evidence indicating that maternal wildfire exposure associates with birth weight reduction (n = 7) and preterm birth (n = 4), particularly when exposure to wildfire smoke occurred in late pregnancy. The association between wildfire exposure and small for gestational age (n = 2) and infant mortality (n = 1) was inconclusive. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that maternal exposure to wildfire during late pregnancy is linked to reduced birth weight and preterm birth. Well-designed comprehensive studies are needed to better understand the perinatal effects of wildfires.

AB  - Little is known about pediatric surgical disease in resource-poor countries. This study documents the surgical care of children in central Haiti and demonstrates the influence of the 2010 earthquake on pediatric surgical delivery. Methods. We conducted a retrospective review of operations performed at Partners in Health/Zanmi Lasante hospitals in central Haiti. Results. Of 2,057 operations performed prior to the earthquake, 423 were pediatric (20.6%). Congenital anomalies were the most common operative indication (159/423 operations; 33.5%). Pediatric surgical volume increased significantly after the earthquake, with 670 operations performed (23.0% post-earthquake v. 20.6% pre-earthquake, p=.03). Trauma and burns became the most common surgical diagnoses after the disaster, and operations for non-traumatic conditions decreased significantly (p<.01). Conclusion. Congenital anomalies represent a significant proportion of baseline surgical need in Haiti. A natural disaster can change the nature of pediatric surgical practice by significantly increasing demand for operative trauma care for months afterward.

KW  - BIOELECTRICAL-IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS
AB  - Extreme heat exposure is associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy and has the potential to impact maternal, neonatal and child health for a lifetime. In an extremely hot climate, pregnant women face an increased risk of premature birth, stillbirth, low birth weight, congenital anomalies and pre-eclampsia. In low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), socio-demographic and behavioural practices may negatively affect body hydration during high temperatures. The possible causes and consequences of dehydration in the heat are poorly understood and have been little discussed in the literature. Living in a hot climate poses various challenges, including dehydration, where biological mechanisms and insufficient access to water can lead to dehydration in women and children, with consequences for the health of both mothers and children, particularly in relation to breastfeeding habits. During pregnancy, increased metabolic and cardiovascular demands interact with heat exhaustion and reduced availability of fresh water, which can affect the child's growth and development. In this opinion piece, we emphasise the possible causes and impacts of dehydration in extreme heat on the health and well-being of mothers and children. We encourage more research, focused on biology and epidemiology, related to raising awareness and implementing adaptations to reduce the risk of dehydration in pregnant, postpartum women and newborns in the context of climate change-related heat exposure.

AB  - Oil spills can lead to irreversible environmental degradation and are a potential hazard to human health. We study how onshore oil spills affect neonatal and infant mortality by combining spatial data from the Nigerian Oil Spill Monitor with Demographic and Health Surveys. To identify a causal effect, we compare siblings born to the same mother, conceived before and after a nearby oil spill. We find that nearby oil spills that occur before conception increase neonatal mortality by 38.3 deaths per 1,000 live births, which corresponds to an increase of around 100% on the sample mean. The effect is fairly uniform across girls and boys, socio-economic backgrounds, and locations. We show that this effect is not driven by events related to oil production or violent conflict. Rather, our results are consistent with medical and epidemiological evidence showing that exposure to hydrocarbons can pose risks to fetal development. We provide further evidence suggesting that the effects of oil spills on neonatal mortality persist for several years after the occurrence of an oil spill.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether maternal residential proximity to a nuclear reactor is associated with prevalence of certain birth defects.
   Study design: The New York State Vital Statistics and Congenital Malformations Registry data (1992-2001) were analyzed for five Hudson Valley counties in a 20-mile radius from the Indian Point nuclear reactor (Buchanan, NY, USA). Four zones of 5-mile increments were used to categorize proximity to the reactor. Data included congenital anomalies, low birth weight, and prematurity.
   Result: Over the 10-year period, 702 malformations in 666 children were identified from a birth population of 328,124, yielding a regional rate of 2.1 major malformations per 1000 births. The prevalence of defects, low birth weight, and prematurity were not related to proximity to the nuclear power plant.
   Conclusion: These data did not substantiate an association between maternal proximity to the reactor and certain birth defects and provide baseline data for comparison in the event of a nuclear accident.

AB  - We developed a comprehensive database of medicines that are used or are being investigated for pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, preterm birth or labour, postpartum haemorrhage, intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal distress and that were in active development between 2000 and 2021. A total of 444 candidates were identified: approximately half of candidates were in active development, two-thirds had been repurposed after initially being used for another condition, and just under half were in preclinical studies. Only 64 candidates were in active late-stage (phase 3) development as of Oct 25, 2021, and given the slow pace of biomedical development, it could take years before any of these products eventually make it to market. A lack of innovation for maternal health medicines persists, and the market continues to fail pregnant individuals. There is a need for collective action from all relevant stakeholders to accelerate investment in the development of new or improved medicines for pregnancy-related conditions.

AB  - Background: Newborn infants hospitalised in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are vulnerable to natural disasters. However, publications on evacuation from NICUs are sparse. The 2016 Kumamoto Earthquakes caused serious damage to Kumamoto City Hospital and its level III regional core NICU. Local/neighbour NICU teams and the disaster-communication team of a neonatal academic society cooperated to evacuate 38 newborn infants from the ward. Objective: The aim of this paper was to highlight potential key factors to improve emergency NICU evacuation and coordination of hospital transportation following natural disasters. Methods: Background variables including clinical risk scores and timing/destination of transportation were compared between infants, who subsequently were transferred to destinations outside of Kumamoto Prefecture, and their peers. Results: All but 1 of the infants were successfully evacuated from their NICU within 8 h. One very-low-birth-weight infant developed moderate hypothermia following transportation. Fourteen infants were transferred to NICUs outside of Kumamoto Prefecture, which was associated with the diagnosis of congenital heart disease, dependence on respiratory support, higher risk scores, and longer elapsed time from the decision to departure. There was difficulty in arranging helicopter transportation because the coordination office of the Disaster Medical Assistance Team had requisitioned most air/ground ambulances and only helped arrange ground transportations for 13 low-risk infants. Transportation for all 10 high-risk infants (risk scores greater than or equal to the upper quartile) was arranged by local/neighbour NICUs. Conclusions: Although the overall evacuation process was satisfactory, potential risks of relying on the adult-based emergency transportation system were highlighted. A better system needs to be developed urgently to put appropriate priority on vulnerable infants. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - The secondary sex ratio (SSR), defined as the ratio of male to female births in a population, has long been a subject of scientific inquiry due to its potential as a health indicator. The interplay between catastrophic events and the delicate balance of male and female births presents a nuanced and compelling study area. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and volcanic eruptions, have been known to disrupt ecosystems and human populations, leading to both short-term and long-term consequences. Studies have suggested a potential influence of these disasters on the SSR, with varying degrees of impact observed across different regions and disaster types. Similarly, nuclear accidents, such as the infamous Chernobyl disaster, have sparked interest in their potential effects on human health and development. The release of radioactive materials into the environment can have far-reaching consequences, including impacts on reproductive outcomes. Through a rigorous examination of the existing literature, the present review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the impacts of natural disasters and nuclear accidents on the SSR and unravel the mechanisms that explain SSR fluctuations. By shedding light on the diverse influences shaping the SSR, this narrative review contributes to a deeper appreciation of the intricate interplay between environmental, biological, and societal factors that determines the SSR, calling for targeted strategies to mitigate potential adverse effects on sex ratios in the aftermath of such events.

AB  - We study the health consequences of one of the largest environmental disasters of the world mining industry, which largely stemmed from regulatory failure. Exploiting the timing and location of the Mariana mine tailings dam collapse in Brazil, we show that in utero exposure to the tragedy significantly reduced birth weight and increased infant mortality. The adverse effects were stronger for infants born to less educated and nonmarried mothers. These findings indicate that poorly enforced environmental regulation may have long-term welfare impacts on local communities.

AB  - Pregnant people are vulnerable to air pollution exposure, including risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and stillbirth. Understanding the infiltration of outdoor wildfire smoke into a residential space is critical for the accurate assessment of wildfire smoke exposure and associated health effects in pregnant people. Relying on ambient measurements of wildfire smoke alone can result in exposure misclassification. In this study, we examine the role of physical housing characteristics in the relationship between smoke exposure and preterm birth. In particular, we examine the effect of home size, year of construction, cooling type, and renovation status, as effect modifiers in the relationship between smoke exposure during pregnancy and preterm birth from 2007 to 2015 in California. To do this, we combined data on home characteristics from the California Tax Assessor, birth outcomes from the California birth records database, and the number of smoke days for each pregnancy from theNOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Hazard Mapping System (HMS). We estimated the association between smoke day exposures and odds of preterm birth using logistic regression models and stratified by air basin and housing characteristics. Our findings reveal that cooling type and renovation status are key factors modifying the smoke exposure-preterm birth relationship. Notably, we found elevated associations for people living in unrenovated homes, those using evaporative cooling systems, and those using central air conditioning units. While we observed elevated odds of preterm birth associated with increasing smoke day exposure for residents of large and new homes, this effect does not significantly differ across home size and age quartiles. This study highlights the need to further examine the relative roles of housing characteristics as well as factors not measured here including behavioral factors, time spent outdoors, window use, and occupational exposures in driving adverse birth outcomes related to wildfire smoke exposure

AB  - Purpose of Review Climate change is the biggest public health threat of the twenty-first century but its impact on the perinatal period has only recently received attention. This review summarizes recent literature regarding the impacts of climate change and related environmental disasters on pregnancy health and provides recommendations to inform future adaptation and mitigation efforts. Recent Findings Accumulating evidence suggests that the changing climate affects pregnancy health directly via discrete environmental disasters (i.e., wildfire, extreme heat, hurricane, flood, and drought), and indirectly through changes in the natural and social environment. Although studies vary greatly in design, analytic methods, and assessment strategies, they generally converge to suggest that climate-related disasters are associated with increased risk of gestational complication, pregnancy loss, restricted fetal growth, low birthweight, preterm birth, and selected delivery/newborn complications. Window(s) of exposure with the highest sensitivity are not clear, but both acute and chronic exposures appear important. Furthermore, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations may be more vulnerable. Policy, clinical, and research strategies for adaptation and mitigation should be continued, strengthened, and expanded with cross-disciplinary efforts. Top priorities should include (a) reinforcing and expanding policies to further reduce emission, (b) increasing awareness and education resources for healthcare providers and the public, (c) facilitating access to quality population-based data in low-resource areas, and (d) research efforts to better understand mechanisms of effects, identify susceptible populations and windows of exposure, explore interactive impacts of multiple exposures, and develop novel methods to better quantify pregnancy health impacts.

AB  - Tropical cyclones cause widespread devastation while having a negative impact on human health and wellbeing. Maternal exposure to prenatal environmental stressors can lead to a shift in reproductive strategies. This study aims to statistically analyse maternal and infant health risks by studying birth outcomes following maternal prenatal exposure to tropical cyclone Yasi in Queensland, Australia. Queensland state birth records collected under the Australian National Perinatal Data Collection from January 2008 to December 2012 were analysed. A confounder controlled binary logistic regression model was used to statistically compare birth weight and gestation length in cyclone Yasi affected and unaffected Queensland local government areas (LGAs). Women in cyclone Yasi affected LGAs, had a significantly higher proportion (9.6%, p = 0.008) and significantly higher odds (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.47) of having a preterm birth, compared to women in unaffected LGAs (7.9%). Women in affected LGAs during the year of cyclone Yasi (2011) also had a higher proportion of low birth weight births compared to women in the same LGAs during non-cyclone Yasi years (2008,2009,2010,2012). Our study supported a significant increase in the proportion of preterm births recorded for women pregnant in areas severely affected by cyclone Yasi. Our findings, and similar future research, will continue to inform the development of effective post-disaster perinatal health related policies and the continued improvement of disaster risk mitigation for vulnerable groups.

AB  - Objective: To examine how the demographic and other population changes affected birth and obstetric outcomes in Louisiana, and the effect of the hurricane on racial disparities in these outcomes.
   Methods: Vital statistics data were used to compare the incidence of low birth weight (LBW) (<2500 g), preterm birth (PTB) (37 weeks' gestation), cesarean section, and inadequate prenatal care (as measured by the Kotelchuck index), in the 2 years after Katrina compared to the 2 years before, for the state as a whole, region 1 (the area around New Orleans), and Orleans Parish (New Orleans). Logistic models were used to adjust for covariates.
   Results: After adjustment, rates of LBW rose for the state, but preterm birth did not. In region 1 and Orleans Parish, rates of LBW and PTB remained constant or fell. These patterns were all strongest in African American women. Rates of cesarean section and inadequate prenatal care rose. Racial disparities in birth outcomes remained constant or were reduced.
   Conclusions: Although risk of LBW/PTB remained higher in African Americans, the storm does not appear to have exacerbated health disparities, nor did population shifts explain the changes in birth and obstetric outcomes. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2010;4:S39-S45)

AB  - We investigated the prevalence of minor psychiatric morbidity in a group of women who were pregnant during or immediately after a major earthquake disaster and we investigated the prognostic factors that may have influenced the perinatal outcome of the pregnancy. The study was initiated 6 months after the earthquake and enrolled 171 women in a town near the epicentre. A Post-Earthquake Questionnaire, Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ-12) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms checklist were completed before delivery while the perinatal data were retrieved from hospital obstetrical records. The prevalence of minor psychiatric morbidity (MPM) was 29.2%. Women with starvation experience, higher negative attitude scores about the influence of earthquake on pregnancy and more casualties among relatives were significantly correlated with high CHQ. A significant positive correlation between the MPM and PTSD scores was noticed. Among the 115 pregnancies with known perinatal outcome, there were nine (7.8%) low-birth weight neonates, defined as birth weight less than or equal to 2500 g. Maternal history of abdominal injury, spouse casualty and instability in living condition were significantly correlated with low birth weight. Spouse casualty was the only significant factor that predicts neonatal low birth weight.

AB  - Understanding how mortality and fertility are linked is essential to the study of population dynamics. We investigate the fertility response to an unanticipated mortality shock that resulted from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed large shares of the residents of some Indonesian communities but caused no deaths in neighboring communities. Using population-representative multilevel longitudinal data, we identify a behavioral fertility response to mortality exposure, both at the level of a couple and in the broader community. We observe a sustained fertility increase at the aggregate level following the tsunami, which was driven by two behavioral responses to mortality exposure. First, mothers who lost one or more children in the disaster were significantly more likely to bear additional children after the tsunami. This response explains about 13 % of the aggregate increase in fertility. Second, women without children before the tsunami initiated family-building earlier in communities where tsunami-related mortality rates were higher, indicating that the fertility of these women is an important route to rebuilding the population in the aftermath of a mortality shock. Such community-level effects have received little attention in demographic scholarship.

AB  - Increasing evidence links exposure to extreme weather events in utero with adverse health outcomes at birth, including lower birth weight. This research, however, often faces data limitations because natural disasters may be localized, often affecting some neighborhoods but not others, whereas outcome data are often available only at higher geographic levels, such as counties. In this article, we intro duce a novel strategy for estimating the effects of geographically bounded disasters when localized outcome data are unavailable. We employ this strategy to estimate the effect of exposure to severe tornadoes on infant birth weight in the United States from 1991 to 2017. We merge county month data on singleton births with block group level monthly data on the paths of severe tornadoes and block group data on the distribution of the population at risk of a birth. We then estimate difference indifferences models in which the treatment variable is equal to the percentage of the population at risk of a birth affected by the tornado. This strategy results in an estimand that is both more interpretable and more policyrelevant than estimands from traditional models. Our findings demonstrate that exposure to a tornado during pregnancy reduced birth weight for Black mothers.

AB  - This study evaluates the long-run effects of early-life exposure to tropical cyclones on the socioeconomic performance of individuals in China. We identify significantly negative effects of gestational typhoon exposure on the educational attainment and annual income in adulthood, which also exhibit a significant gender inequality favoring the male. Despite the small culling effects from pregnancy failure and infant mortality, gestational typhoon exposures increase the probability of having a younger sibling and shorten the subsequent birth interval. Typhoon damage to the health and economic abilities of adults, as well as the local economy indicates a channel of household economic status for the reduced long-run socioeconomic outcomes.

AB  - Background Air pollution exposure has been associated with critical neonatal morbidities, including low birth weight (LBW). However, little is known on short-term exposure to wildfire smoke and LBW. In this study, we estimated the association between birth weight following pregnancy and wildfire smoke exposure in more than 1.5 million newborns in Brazil (considered as a very fire-prone region worldwide).
   Methods We applied a logistic regression model to estimate the percent variation in newborns with low birth weight when exposed to wildfire in different trimesters of the pregnancy.
   Findings After adjusting the model with relevant covariates, we found that an increase of 100 wildfire records in Brazil was associated with an increase in low birth weight in the Midwest region [0.98% (95%CI:0.34; 1.63)] and in the South region [18.55% (95%CI:13.66; 23.65)] when the exposure occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy.
   Interpretation Wildfires were associated with LBW and this should be of public health concern for policymakers.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the relation between early exposure to stressful events and symptoms of the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children, based on the outcomes from a natural experiment. It was hypothesized that children pre- and postnatally exposed to cyclone Aila have increased ADHD symptoms compared to the control group, and the effect depends on the timing of the exposure. Indian children (8-11 years) prenatally (N = 336) and early postnatally (N = 216) exposed to cyclone Aila were compared to a non-exposed control peer group (N = 285). ADHD symptoms were assessed using the Conner's Teacher Rating Scale Revised. The main effect of exposure to the cyclone on the total ADHD symptoms' score, ADHD index, Hyperactivity and Oppositional symptoms was significant and independent to covariates: age and sex of children, gestational age and birth weight, maternal stress during the year before the study and the socioeconomic status of a family. The timing of exposure and sex of the children were found to be a significant moderator of the relation between early exposure to the natural disaster and ADHD symptoms. The prenatal, but also early postnatal exposure to stressful experiences such as a natural disaster, may disturb the development of cognitive functions and behavioural control, thus increasing the risk of ADHD in children.

AB  - Objective Hurricanes are powerful tropical storm systems with high winds which influence many health effects. Few studies have examined whether hurricane exposure is associated with preterm delivery. We aimed to estimate associations between maternal hurricane exposure and hazard of preterm delivery. Methods We used data on 342,942 singleton births from Florida Vital Statistics Records 2004-2005 to capture pregnancies at risk of delivery during the 2004 hurricane season. Maternal exposure to Hurricane Charley was assigned based on maximum wind speed in maternal county of residence. We estimated hazards of overall preterm delivery (<37 gestational weeks) and extremely preterm delivery (<32 gestational weeks) in Cox regression models, adjusting for maternal/pregnancy characteristics. To evaluate heterogeneity among racial/ethnic subgroups, we performed analyses stratified by race/ethnicity. Additional models investigated whether exposure to multiples hurricanes increased hazard relative to exposure to one hurricane. Results Exposure to wind speeds >= 39 mph from Hurricane Charley was associated with a 9 % (95 % CI 3, 16 %) increase in hazard of extremely preterm delivery, while exposure to wind speed >= 74 mph was associated with a 21 % (95 % CI 6, 38 %) increase. Associations appeared greater for Hispanic mothers compared to non-Hispanic white mothers. Hurricane exposure did not appear to be associated with hazard of overall preterm delivery. Exposure to multiple hurricanes did not appear more harmful than exposure to a single hurricane. Conclusions Hurricane exposure may increase hazard of extremely preterm delivery. As US coastal populations and hurricane severity increase, the associations between hurricane and preterm delivery should be further studied.

AB  - According to the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis, low-birthweight (LBW) infants are programmed to seek additional resources as compensation for early deprivation. However, no study has yet explored this in the context of delay discounting (DD), which refers to the tendency to prefer smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed ones. Both prenatal factors, such as LBW, and postnatal factors, including adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and exposure to natural disasters, may influence DD. To investigate whether LBW children seek larger future rewards, we analyzed LBW's effect on DD, accounting for ACEs and natural disaster exposure. This prospective cohort study involved 167 children from areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE), with a mean age of 8.3 years at the time of the DD experiment. LBW was assessed in the 2012 baseline questionnaire using the Mother-Child Handbook, along with ACEs prior to the GEJE and traumatic earthquake experiences. In 2014, DD was assessed through a token-based experiment where children allocated tokens for either immediate rewards (one candy per token for "now") or delayed rewards (two candies per token for "one month later"). Our results showed that children with LBW and three or more ACEs exhibited lower DD, while traumatic earthquake experiences were not associated with DD. These findings suggest that children with LBW and multiple ACEs may develop adaptive strategies to seek more resources, indicating a responsive reward system to childhood adversity, even after exposure to a severe natural disaster.

AB  - Consistent with the paradigm shifting observations of David Barker and colleagues that revealed a powerful relationship between decreased weight through 2 years of age and adult disease, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preterm birth are independent risk factors for the development of subsequent hypertension. Animal models have been indispensable in defining the mechanisms responsible for these associations and the potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Among the modifiable risk factors, micronutrient deficiency, physical immobility, exaggerated stress hormone exposure and deficient trophic hormone production are leading candidates for targeted therapies. With the strong inverse relationship seen between gestational age at delivery and the risk of hypertension in adulthood trumping all other major cardiovascular risk factors, improvements in neonatal care are required. Unfortunately, therapeutic breakthroughs have not kept pace with rapidly improving perinatal survival, and groundbreaking benchto-bedside studies are urgently needed to mitigate and ultimately prevent the tsunami of prematurity-related adult cardiovascular disease that may be on the horizon. This review highlights our current understanding of the developmental origins of hypertension and draws attention to the importance of increasing the availability of lactation consultants, nutritionists, pharmacists and physical therapists as critical allies in the battle that IUGR or premature infants are waging not just for survival but also for their future cardiometabolic health.

AB  - The link between population dynamics and climate-related severe events is complicated. Extreme weather events (EWEs), along with other factors such as socioeconomic and cultural factors, influence population dynamics, particularly changes in fertility, mortality, and migration. This study focuses solely on the fertility aspect of climate change and aims to investigate it in Bangladesh, which is extremely sensitive to climate change and EWEs such as floods, cyclones, and droughts. On a regular basis, the country is confronted with a number of EWEs. The current study examines how different types of extreme weather events affect vulnerable people's decisions to have children or to prefer children of a certain gender. People who reside in a particular area may be more vulnerable to particular EWE types, which may result in different preferences for fertility and gender. This study employed individual-level data from three places (flood-prone, drought-prone, and cyclone-prone), each exposed to a distinct hazard, to address this issue, and collected pertinent information from 177 respondents in the susceptible areas using a survey questionnaire. The quantitative results show that the gender of the first child, the perceived risk of infant death due to EWE, the opinion on having more children to recover from the damage and losses caused by EWE, government and non-governmental organization (NGO) support during EWE, and the intended timing of child bearing (after or before EWE) are all significant factors influencing fertility preferences and gender preferences. The findings also indicate that the three regions under investigation have statistically distinct preferences for fertility and gender. There were larger differences between flood-prone areas and drought- and cyclone-prone areas. The complex issue of variations due to different EWEs requires more in-depth studies with larger samples and different methodological techniques.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the effect of earthquakes and terrorist attacks on birth outcomes. These events are unexpected and obvious sources of distress, but could affect fetal health through multiple channels. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System for the period 1969-2004, we estimate the relationship between prenatal exposure to the Super Bowl and low birth weight. Although sporting events can elicit intense emotions, they do not pollute the environment or threaten viewers with direct physical harm. We find that Super Bowl exposure is associated with a small, but precisely estimated, increase in the probability of low birth weight.

AB  - Psychological maternal stress is thought to be a factor in poor infant health, but direct evidence is difficult to obtain. We posit that the 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles, California provides a natural test of the effect of mothers' stress on infants' birth weight and gestation. The Northridge disaster featured a low rate of injury and a quick recovery, but long-lasting and well documented consequences for mental health. Difference-in-difference results show that infants born closest to the epicenter were 0.2 percentage points more likely to be born with low birth weight. Impacts were larger and more precisely identified for women who experienced the earthquake in their first or third trimester. Among the subsample of mothers most susceptible to stress first-time, single mothers low birth weight was 0.5 percentage points more likely to occur. We find little evidence that the earthquake affected preterm delivery. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Large-scale power outages (PO) are increasing in the context of climate change. Although some research has been conducted into the adverse health impacts of POs, significant gaps remain regarding whether POs would affect the health of pregnant women. We investigated the association between ED visits due to pregnancy complications and the occurence, intensity, and duration of large-scale POs in eight Sandy-affected counties in New York State (NYS).
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, daily ED visits for pregnancy complications and large-scale POdata in eight counties in NYS from October to December in 2005-2014 were collected. Using time-series analysis, we estimated the relative increase in ED visits for pregnancy complications during POs compared with non-PO periods at lag 0-7 days. Short-term health impacts of PO intensity and PO duration were investigated. Estimations were also stratified by sociodemographic characteristics and disease subtypes including threatened or spontaneous abortion, threatened or early labor, hypertension complications, infections of genitourinary tract, renal diseases, gestational diabetes mellitus, mental illnesses, and cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy.
   Results: From October to December in 2005-2014, there were 307,739 ED visits for pregnancy complications in the eight counties. We found significant increases in ED visits for overall pregnancy complications (16.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.3%, 23.2%) during the Hurricane-PO period at lag 0-7 days. The ED visits increased by 8.8% per level increase in PO intensity and 1.4% per day increase in PO duration. Specifically, threatened/ early delivery and gestational diabetes mellitus during the PO period increased by 26.7% (95% CI: 8.2%, 48.4%) and 111.8% (95% CI: 16.7%, 284.4%), respectively. Young adult, Black, Hispanic, and uninsured individuals were at higher risk of complications.
   Conclusions: POs may adversely impact pregnancy, especially for certain pregnancy complications and among low sociodemographic women. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with birth outcomes, including birthweight. Exposure to natural disasters during pregnancy provides a model to study these relationships. However, few studies assess both stress and diet, which might have interactive effects. Furthermore, most are conducted in high-income countries. Patterns might differ in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Aim: To study relationships between stress and diet during pregnancy, and infant birthweight, following a natural disaster in a lower-middle income country.
   Subjects and methods: In 2015, the island nation of Vanuatu suffered a Category 5 cyclone. Three months later, the authors assessed hardship due to the cyclone, distress, and dietary diversity among 900 women, including 187 pregnant women. Of these, 70 had birth records available. Multivariate linear regression was used to analyse relationships between cyclone exposure and infant birthweight among this sub-sample.
   Results: Neither hardship nor dietary diversity predicted birthweight. Distress was a robust predictor, explaining 8.5% of variance (p=0.012). There were no interactive relationships between distress and other exposure variables.
   Conclusions: Maternal distress following a natural disaster has important implications for maternal and child health. In LMICs, low birthweight remains a pressing public health concern. Distress during pregnancy might represent one underlying risk factor.

AB  - Background: The reductions achieved in infant mortality in Japan are globally regarded as remarkable. However, no studies in Japan have classified infant mortality trends into neonatal and postneonatal or considered regional issues. This study aimed to explore trends in neonatal and postneonatal deaths, both overall for Japan and in a region affected by a natural disaster.
   Methods: Drawing on national infant death data, we used a multi-attribute compositional study design to examine all infant deaths occurring in a region affected by a disaster (Tohoku, which consists of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima) between 2002 and 2012. We used conjoint analysis to clarify the associations between infant and maternal characteristics and age of infant death.
   Results: We obtained data of a total of 31,012 infant deaths between 2002 and 2012, which included 1450 from Tohoku. Infant mortality rates in Japan overall declined over the period but increased in 2011. There were more postneonatal (29-364 days post-birth) than neonatal (0-28 days post-birth) deaths. Infant deaths in Tohoku declined slightly overall, with a fluctuation in 2011. In Tohoku, the trends in postneonatal death rates were similar; the overall rates for males increased, but those for females decreased in 2011. We found that the cause and place of infant death differed by gender for neonatal and postneonatal deaths in both Japan in general and Tohoku. The conjoint analysis showed that most variables affected the age of postneonatal death. The factor with the largest influence on the variation in infant death age was gestational week (55.5%). A maternal gestational week <= 36 was linked to an average age at death of 43.4 days, and > 37 was linked to an average of 83.7 days.
   Conclusions: In Japan, infant death rates have declined steadily over the past 10 years. The recent trends indicated that postneonatal death rates were higher than neonatal rates, especially in Tohoku. However, not much attention has been focused on postneonatal deaths in Japan. Our findings may help health planners to prioritise work on the factors that are linked to infant deaths in the neonatal and postneonatal periods.

AB  - Prior to Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico already had 200+ hazardous waste sites, significant contamination of water resources, and among the highest rates of preterm birth in the USA. To address these issues, the Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) Center was formed in 2010 to investigate prenatal environmental exposures, particularly phthalates, and adverse birth outcomes. Recent work from the PROTECT study confirms that in utero exposure to certain phthalates is associated with shorter gestation and increased risk of preterm birth. However, previous research also suggests that pregnant women who experience a natural disaster such as Hurricane Maria are at higher risk of adverse birth outcomes, but it is unknown whether this is due to stress, hazardous exposures, or a combination of factors. Thus, the aim of this analysis was to characterize hurricane-related changes in phthalate exposures and experiences within the PROTECT cohort. Among 176 participants who were pregnant during or within 5 months after Maria, 122 completed a questionnaire on hurricane-related experiences. Questionnaire results and biomarkers of exposure suggest that participants did not have regular access to fresh foods and water during hurricane recovery, and almost half reported structural damage to their home. In addition, biomarker concentrations of phthalates commonly used in food packaging were higher among participants post-hurricane, while phthalates commonly used in personal care products were lower compared to pre-hurricane levels. Hurricane-related increases in phthalate exposure, as well as widespread structural damage, food and water shortages, and long-term absence of electricity and cell phone service, likely increased the risk of adverse birth outcomes among this already vulnerable population.

AB  - Background: Frequent natural disasters like floods pose a major threat to India, with significant implications for public health. Low birth weight (LBW) is a critical global health concern, contributing to neonatal mortality. However, the association between floods and LBW remains underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the association between flood hazards and LBW in India using a geospatial approach. By analyzing data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) and flood zonation maps, the study aims to uncover the spatial dynamics of this association, offering insights into the implications of floods on birth weight across diverse geographical regions.Methods: The study used the fifth round of NFHS data, 2019-21, which involved 202,194 children selected through a multi-stage stratified sampling technique. The Vulnerability Atlas of India 2019 maps were also uti-lized to classify areas as flood or non-flood zones. Birth weight data from the NFHS-5 were categorized into three groups: very low, low, and normal birth weight (VLBW, LBW and NBW). Control variables including flood exposure, socio-demographic attributes, and geographic region were considered. Bivariate analysis and multi-nomial logistic regression were employed for statistical analysis. The spatial analysis involved Moran's I statistics and Geographically Weighted Regression to explore spatial dynamics of the association between floods and birth weight in India.Results: Floods predominantly affect India's lower Himalayan belts and western coastal regions. Flood-affected areas show higher proportions of VLBW and LBW infants. Groundwater usage and unimproved sanitation are associated with higher risk of VLBW and LBW. Sex, wealth, maternal education, residence type, and geographic region significantly influence birth weights. Multinomial logistic regression reveals 8 % and 27 % higher risks for LBW and VLBW in flood-affected regions. LISA cluster maps identify high-risk areas for both LBW and floods. Geographically Weighted Regression highlights 52 % of the variability in LBW occurrences can be attributed to the influence of flood hazards. Families hailing from the poorest wealth background and exposed to flood hazards bear a 5 % heightened likelihood of delivering LBW infants, in stark contrast to their counterparts from the same economic background yet unaffected by floods.Conclusions: The significant association between floods and LBW underscores the importance of robust disaster preparedness and public health strategies. By unraveling the spatial intricacies of flood-induced LBW disparities, this research provides valuable insights for promoting healthier birth outcomes and reducing child mortality rates, particularly in flood-prone regions. These findings emphasize the importance of holistic policies that address both environmental challenges and socioeconomic inequalities to safeguard maternal and infant health across the nation.

AB  - Objective: To assess the risk for preterm deliveries <37 week of gestation and associated prevalence of vaginal infection in a rural setting after the tsunami in Banda Aceh, Indonesia.
   Methods: Wet mount microscopy, vaginal pH and vaginal swabs for microbiological culture were collected in pregnant women during the 2nd trimester from February to June of 2005 in four temporary outpatient clinics and the patients were followed up until delivery.
   Results: One hundred and fifty-nine pregnant patients were screened. Sixty-two could be followed up until delivery. Thirty-nine (62.9%) delivered at term and 23 (37.1%) delivered prematurely. Significant risk factors for preterm delivery were a history of preterm delivery and group B streptococcus infection. Increased vaginal pH alone had no significant influence on preterm delivery, although there was a trend.
   Conclusion: The rate of preterm delivery was high in this cohort. We suggest risk stratification for preterm delivery in rural conditions by performing a vaginal pH and wet mount microscopy. If either is suspect we suggest collecting a vaginal swab for microbiological culture for targeted treatment. Patients with a history of preterm delivery are at increased risk and should be monitored closely.

AB  - Objective: Prenatal hurricane exposure may be an increasingly important contributor to poor reproductive health outcomes. In the current literature, mixed associations have been suggested between hurricane exposure and reproductive health outcomes. This may be due, in part, to residual confounding. We assessed the association between hurricane exposure and reproductive health outcomes by using a difference-in-difference analysis technique to control for confounding in a cohort of Florida pregnancies.
   Methods: We implemented a difference-in-difference analysis to evaluate hurricane weather and reproductive health outcomes including low birth weight, fetal death, and birth rate. The study population for analysis included all Florida pregnancies conceived before or during the 2003 and 2004 hurricane season. Reproductive health data were extracted from vital statistics records from the Florida Department of Health. In 2004, 4 hurricanes (Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne) made landfall in rapid succession; whereas in 2003, no hurricanes made landfall in Florida.
   Results: Overall models using the difference-in-difference analysis showed no association between exposure to hurricane weather and reproductive health.
   Conclusions: The inconsistency of the literature on hurricane exposure and reproductive health may be in part due to biases inherent in pre-post or regression-based county-level comparisons. We found no associations between hurricane exposure and reproductive health.

AB  - Smoke front massive wildfires blanketed Indonesia in late 1997. This paper examines the impact that this air pollution (particulate matter) had on fetal, infant, and child mortality. Exploiting the sharp tinting and spatial patterns of the pollution and inferring deaths front "missing children" in the 2000 Indonesian Census, I find that the pollution led to 15,600 missing children in Indonesia (1.2 percent of the affected birth cohorts). Prenatal exposure to pollution drives the result. The effect size is much larger in poorer areas, suggesting that differential effects of pollution contribute to the socioeconomic gradient in health.

AB  - Research documenting the public health impacts of natural disasters often focuses on adults and children. Little research has examined the influence of extreme events, like floods, on maternal health, and less has examined the effect of disasters on maternal indicators like severe maternal morbidity (SMM) or unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery. The aim of this study is to iden- tify the impacts of the 2015 flood events on maternal health outcomes in South Carolina, USA. We employ a quasi-experimental design using a difference-in-difference analysis with log- binomial regressions to evaluate outcomes for impacted and control locations during the disaster event. Unlike previous studies, we extended our difference-in-difference analysis to include a trimester of exposure to assess the timing of flood exposure. We did not find evidence of statisti- cally significant main effects on maternal health from the 2015 flood events related to preterm birth, gestational diabetes, mental disorders of pregnancy, depression, and generalized anxiety. However, we did find a statistically significant increase in SMM and low birth weight during the flood event for women in select trimester periods who were directly exposed. Our work provides new evidence on the effects of extreme flood events, like the 2015 floods, which can impact ma- ternal health during specific exposure periods of pregnancy. Additional research is needed across other extreme weather events, as the unique context of the 2015 floods limits the generalizability of our findings.

AB  - Floods are becoming more frequent and severe in the context of climate change, with major impacts on human health. However, their effect on infant mortality remains unknown, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a sibling-matched case-control study using individual-level data from Demographic and Health Surveys in Africa during 1990-2020. Individual flood experience was determined by matching the residential coordinates with flood events from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory database. Using data from 514,760 newborns, we found increased risks of infant mortality associated with flood exposure across multiple periods, with the risks remaining elevated for up to four years after the flood event. Overall, flood exposure was associated with 3.42 infant deaths per 1000 births in Africa from 2000 to 2020, approximately 1.7 times the burden associated with life-period exposure. This multi-country study in Africa provides novel evidence that flood events may increase infant mortality risk and burden, even over years after exposure.
   Floods are becoming more frequent and severe, with major impacts on human health. Here, authors show increased risks of infant mortality associated with flood exposure, and the risks remain elevated for up to four years after the flood event.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the effect of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) on the acute response of tissue protein synthesis to feeding in newborn pigs. Newborn pigs of sows fed either control or protein-restricted diets throughout gestation were designated C or IUGR, respectively Both groups were either fasted for 9 h after birth or fed hourly 30 ml colostrum/kg body wt for 2.75 h after a 6-h fast. Fractional rates of tissue protein synthesis (K-s) were measured in vivo with a flooding dose of L-[4-H-3]phenylalanine. Birth weight was reduced by 33% in IUGR pigs. IUGR had no effect on K-s in skeletal muscles, heart, liver, jejunum, or pancreas. Feeding stimulated tissue K-s similarly in C and IUGR pigs. Fasting plasma insulin concentrations and their rise with feeding were unaffected by IUGR. Plasma insulin-like growth factor I(IGF-I) concentrations were reduced by 42% in IUGR pigs and were not altered by feeding in either IUGR or C pigs. There were positive nonlinear relationships between tissue Ks and circulating concentrations of insulin. The results indicate that, in newborn pigs, tissue K-s are unaffected by IUGR, despite reduced plasma IGF-I concentrations. The efficiency with which nutrients stimulate tissue K-s is also not altered by IUGR, perhaps because the rise in plasma insulin concentrations with feeding is unaffected by IUGR.

AB  - Wildfire smoke contains many different types of air pollutants which are cause for concern. Studies on epidemiology have identified correlations between PM2.5 exposure to wildfire smoke and mortality, respiratory and cardiovascular morbidities, and may result in a reduction in birth weight. However, evidence from Indonesia is limited. For this study, a retrospective cohort epidemiological study was undertaken to quantify the Indonesian population's exposure to wildfire-PM2.5. We present 9652 (88%) records of newborns to identify an association between fire-sourced PM2.5 and birth weight in Palangka Raya, Indonesia from 2015 to 2019. On an annual basis, geospatial, and season variations in wildfire-PM2.5 concentrations were observed using a satellite-based dataset from CAMS and used for gestational exposure to wildfire smoke. Applying a general linear model with birth weight (yi) as a continuous outcome, the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and low birth weight was examined. In addition, the binary outcome of low birth weight was analysed. A statistically significant difference in the birth weight reduction between infants delivered to mothers exposed to high levels of wildfire smoke and those exposed to low levels of wildfire smoke was observed over the entire time frame (2015-2019) (rho-value < 0.001). In comparison to infants born to mothers exposed to lower concentrations, the birth weight of infants delivered to mothers exposed to high concentrations of PM2.5 in the third trimester decreased by 19.96%. A 1.9% reduction in birth weight could be caused by exposure during the fire-prevalent in the first trimester of pregnancy (rho-value < 0.001). Since an estimation model predicted a 10 g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 exposure between the first and last trimesters of pregnancy, variations in the second trimester did not significantly affect the association (rho-value = 0.761). This emphasizes the significance of foetal development during these two trimesters. Exposure to pollution from wildfires contributes significantly to the global burden of newborns' birth weight.

AB  - Background: Hurricane Harvey made landfall in August 2017 and resulted in catastrophic flooding in Houston, Texas. Prior studies of hurricanes and preterm birth have found conflicting results. We tested the hypotheses that exposure to Hurricane Harvey was associated with a higher risk of spontaneous pre- and early-term birth and assessed vulnerable subpopulations. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of singleton births using administrative birth records in the nine-county greater Houston area from 2015 to 2019. We estimated the likelihood of pre- and early-term births using logistic regression, comparing births occurring during or within 1, 2, or 4 weeks of Hurricane Harvey to unexposed reference periods encompassing the same dates 2 years prior and after. Stratified models assessed effect modification by degree of flooding, birth parent age, high- vs. low-risk pregnancy, race/ethnicity, and prenatal care. Results: Among 15,564 births, we found no association between exposure to Hurricane Harvey and spontaneous preterm birth within 1 week adjusted (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91, 1.25) but a 14% higher odds of spontaneous early-term birth (OR, 1.14; 95% CI = 1.04, 1.25). The odds of early-term birth were even higher in neighborhoods with severe flooding (OR, 1.21; 95% CI = 1.05, 1.38), segregated neighborhoods (OR, 1.23; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.47), and among foreign-born Hispanics (OR, 1.21; 95% CI = 1.04, 1.53) and pregnant people receiving no prenatal care (OR, 1.37; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.82). Effect estimates were attenuated or null when considering 2-week or 4-week lags to define exposure. Conclusions: Hurricane Harvey was associated with higher odds of spontaneous early-term birth up to 1 week later, especially among socially marginalized populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as wildfires are expected to increase due to climate change. Childbearing women, that is, women who are pregnant, soon to be pregnant, or have recently given birth, may be particularly vulnerable to the effect of wildfire exposure. OBJECTIVES: This review sought to systematically assess what is known about birth outcomes, health, and health care needs of childbearing women during and after exposure to wildfires. METHODS: An integrative review methodology was utilized to enable article selection, data extraction, and synthesis across qualitative and quantitative studies. Comprehensive searches of SCOPUS (including MEDLINE and Embase), CINAHL, PubMed, and Google Scholar identified studies for inclusion with no date restriction. Included studies were independently appraised by two reviewers using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool. The findings are summarized and illustrated in tables. RESULTS: Database searches identified 480 records. Following title, abstract, and full text screening, sixteen studies published between 2012 and 2022 were identified for this review. Eleven studies considered an association between in utero exposure to wildfire and impacts on birth weight and length of gestation. One study reported increased rates of maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and gestational hypertension following exposure; whereas one study reported differences in the secondary sex ratio. Two studies reported higher incidence of birth defects following in utero exposure to wildfire smoke. Three studies reported increased mental health morbidity, and one study associated a reduction in breastfeeding among women who evacuated from a wildfire disaster. DISCUSSION: Evidence indicates that wildfire exposure may be associated with changes to birth outcomes and increased morbidity for childbearing women and their babies. These effects may be profound and have long-term and wide-ranging public health implications. This research can inform the development of effective clinical and public health strategies to address the needs of childbearing women exposed to wildfire disaster.

AB  - Children comprise approximately 22% of the population in the United States.1 In a widespread disaster such as a hurricane, pandemic, wildfire or major earthquake, children are at least proportionately affected to their share of the population, if not more so. They also have unique vulnerabilities including physical, mental, and developmental differences from adults, which make them more prone to adverse health effects of disasters.2-4 There are about 5000 pediatric critical care beds and 23 000 neonatal intensive care beds out of 900 000 total hospital beds in the United States.5 While no mechanism exists to consistently track pediatric acute care beds nationally (especially in real time), a previous study6 showed a 7% decline in pediatric medical-surgical beds between 2002 and 2011. This study also estimated there are about 30 000 acute care pediatric beds nationally. Finding appropriate hospital resources for the provision of care for pediatric disaster victims is an important concern for those charged with triaging patients in a major event.

AB  - Background: The chemical, physical, economic, and social effects of a major oil spill might adversely affect pregnancy health. Objectives: To examine the relationship between oil spill exposure and birth outcomes in a cohort of women living near the Gulf of Mexico at the time of the 2010 oil spill. Methods: Between 2012 and 2016, 1375 women reported their exposure to the oil spill, and at least one livebirth. Five hundred and three had births both before and after the oil spill. Indicators of oil spill exposure included selfreported financial consequences, direct contact with oil, traumatic experiences, loss of use of the coast, and involvement in litigation. Birth outcomes were low birthweight (LBW; birthweight <2500 g) and preterm birth (PTB; >3 weeks early). Women who were not pregnant at the time of the interview (n = 1001) self-reported outcomes, while women who were pregnant (n = 374) primarily had them abstracted from medical records (n = 374). All pregnancies prior to the oil spill were considered unexposed; those after the oil spill were considered exposed or unexposed depending on interview responses. Generalized estimating equations were used to control for clustering within women, with control for confounders. Results: The most common type of exposure was economic (49%), but 302 women (22.0%) reported some degree of direct contact with the oil. Associations between most indicators of oil spill exposure and pregnancy outcomes were null, although when all pregnancies were examined, associations were seen with high levels of contact with oil for LBW (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 2.19, 95% CI, 1.29-3.71) and PTB (aOR 2.27, 1.34-3.87). Discussion: In this community-based cohort, we did not find associations between report of exposure to the oil spill, with the possible exception of high oil contact in some analyses, and birth outcomes. Research incorporating specific biomarkers of oil spill exposure and stress biomarkers would be valuable, to allow for assessing both perceived and actual exposure, especially when direct toxicant exposure is minimal.

AB  - Introduction This study aimed to provide an overview of the research landscape and to identify research gaps linking climate change events and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the negative impacts of climate change are most severe.Methods We conducted a scoping review to map research studies that link climate change events or factors and SRHR aspects in LMICs. We performed a structured literature search across six databases to identify relevant peer-reviewed publications between January 1994 and 6 September 2023. The literature search yielded 14 674 peer-reviewed articles. After screening, 75 articles were included, spanning 99 countries across the globe.Results Climate change events such as extreme temperatures, drought, rainfall shocks, cyclones and floods were found to be associated with negative maternal and newborn health outcomes ranging from reduced or low birth weight, preterm births and low Apgar scores, to lack of pregnancy care, pregnancy complications, stillbirths, and newborn and maternal deaths. Associations were also found between climate-related events and increased gender-based violence and HIV prevalence, as well as fertility decisions and harmful practices such as female genital mutilations and early and forced marriages. About two-thirds (48/75) of the articles were from the African or Western Pacific regions. The main research gaps on climate change-related events and SRHR included abortion, reproductive cancers and contraception use.Conclusion Complementing existing evidence with targeted research to fill these knowledge gaps could enhance mitigation programmes and policies.

AB  - Background The prolonged effects of disasters on reproductive outcomes among the survivors are less studied, and the findings are inconsistent. We examined the associations of maternal exposure to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake years before conception with adverse birth outcomes. Methods We included 73,493 women who delivered in 96 hospitals in 24 provinces and autonomous regions from the 2015/16 China Labor and Delivery Survey. We weighted the multivariable logistic models based on the combination of coarsened exact matching (CEM) weight and survey weight, and performed sex-stratified analysis to test whether associations of maternal earthquake exposure with adverse birth outcomes (Stillbirth, preterm birth [PTB], low birthweight [LBW], and small for gestational age [SGA]) varied by sex. Results The bivariate models showed that the weighted incidence of each adverse birth outcome was higher in exposed group than unexposed group: stillbirth (2.00% vs. 1.33%), PTB (14.14% vs. 7.32%), LBW (10.82% vs. 5.76%), and SGA (11.32% vs. 9.52%). The multivariable models showed maternal earthquake exposure was only associated significantly with a higher risk of PTB in offspring among all births (adjusted risk ratio [aRR](95%CI):1.25(1.06-1.48),P = 0.010). The sex-stratified analysis showed the association was significant among male births (aRR (95%CI): 1.40(1.12-1.75),P = 0.002),but unsignificant among female births. The sensitivity analysis reported similar findings. Conclusions The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake exposure has a long-term effect on PTB. Maternal acute exposure to disasters could be a major monitor for long-term reproductive outcomes. More attention should be paid to the underlining reasons for disaster-related adverse birth outcomes.

AB  - We undertake a nationwide US study to estimate how mega-fires (defined as wildfires >100,000 acres in size) affect short-term infant health outcomes in communities located within the flame zone. This is the first study to look exclusively at mega-fires, which have unique characteristics compared to smaller wildfire events and are becoming more frequent in the US. We find that pregnant mothers in affected counties experience 0.8 percentage point greater instances of low birth weight and 1.2 percentage point greater instances of prematurity. The low birth weight finding is equivalent to what would be expected if a mother smoked approximately 6.2 cigarettes per day during pregnancy. Importantly, impacts are potentially non-linearly increasing in mega-fire size. Improved benefit-cost analyses are needed to account for mega-fire indirect impacts when making wildfire control and suppression decisions.

AB  - An agrarian structure predominated by small and marginal farmers; and repeated natural calamities like droughts, floods and cyclones and poor infrastructural development in the hilly terrain of western and southern Odisha have an adverse effect on the health status of the people of Odisha. As a result of which the birth rate, death rate, infant mortality rate, life expectancy rate, maternal mortality ratio, total fertility ratio, etc., of Odisha lags behind the national average. To improve the prevailing situation, the Government of Odisha launched the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) programme in the state on 17 June 2005. The NRHM has completed six years in Odisha. It becomes necessary to assess the impact of the NRHM on the health indicators, to know how the schemes under NRHM are working in Odisha and to assess the transition in the health status of Odisha. Both primary and secondary data are used for the analysis of data. Primary data was collected through personal interviews. Multiple Regression Analysis was used to know how the State Government Capital Expenditure (SGCE) and State Government Revenue Expenditure (SGRE) on health and family welfare have influenced the health indicators like infant mortality rate, birth rate, death rate, etc.

AB  - The current study examined the effects of a natural disaster (a sudden onset flood) as a stressor in pregnancy on infant fine and gross motor development at 2, 6, and 16 months of age. Whether the timing of the stressor in pregnancy or sex of the infant moderated the impact of the prenatal maternal stress on motor development was also explored. Mothers' objective experiences of the flood, emotional reactions and distress, and their cognitive appraisal of the event were assessed retrospectively. Infants' fine and gross motor skills were assessed with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, and results showed age-related changes in the effects of prenatal maternal stress on these domains. At 2 months, higher levels of prenatal maternal stress was positively related to infant motor development, yet at 6 and 16 months of age there was a negative association, particularly if flood exposure occurred later in pregnancy and if mothers had negative cognitive appraisals of the event. Results also showed differential effects of the maternal stress responses to the floods on infants' fine and gross motor development at each age and that infant sex did not buffer these effects.

AB  - Wildfires have been affecting California greatly, and vulnerable patients in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are not exempt. Our aim was to learn how personnel working in NICUs of California hospitals handled issues of neonatal transfer during wildfire disasters in recent years, with an ultimate goal to share lessons learned with healthcare teams on disaster preparedness. We identified California fires through newspaper articles and the CalFire.gov list. We determined which hospitals were affected and contacted members of the healthcare team through connections via the California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative (CPQCC) database. We audio recorded interviews over phone or remote conferencing software or by written survey. We coded and analyzed transcripts and survey responses. While describing disaster preparedness, equipment (such as bassinets and backpacks), ambulance access/transport and documentation/charting were noted as important and essential. Teamwork, willingness to do other tasks that are not part of typical job descriptions, and unconventional strategies contribute to the success of keeping NICU babies safe when California wildfire strikes. Healthcare teams developed ingenious and surprising ways to evacuate NICU babies.

AB  - This paper investigates the persistent effects of negative shocks in utero and in infancy on low-income children's health and cognitive outcomes and examines whether timing of exposure matters differentially by skill type. Specifically, I exploit the geographic intensity of extreme floods in Ecuador during the 1997-1998 El Nino phenomenon, which provides exogenous variation in exposure at different periods of early development. I show that children exposed to severe floods in utero, especially during the third trimester, are shorter in stature five and seven years later. Also, children affected by the floods in the first trimester of pregnancy score lower on cognitive tests. Additionally, I explore potential mechanisms by studying health at birth and family inputs (income, consumption, and breastfeeding). I find that children exposed to El Nino floods, especially during the third trimester in utero, were more likely to be born with low birth weight. Furthermore, households affected by El Nino suffered a decline in income, total consumption, and food consumption in the aftermath of the shock. Falsification exercises and robustness checks suggest that selection concerns such as selective fertility, mobility, and infant mortality do not drive these results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the association between medical institution change for perinatal care and gestational duration after the Great East Japan Earthquake using data from the Fukushima Health Management Survey.
   Methods: The data of pregnant women who experienced the earthquake in Fukushima prefecture and participated in the Pregnancy and Birth Survey as part of the Fukushima Health Management Survey were analyzed. The primary and secondary outcomes of this study were gestational duration and preterm birth, respectively. The main study factor was prenatal checkup institution (only one institution, changed institution due to self-referral, changed institution due to medical indication, and went to parents' home for childbirth). Self-referral was considered as indicative of relocation after the disaster. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of earthquake on each outcome.
   Results: A total of 5593 (60.2%) participants experienced the earthquake between the 4th and 37th weeks of their gestational period. After controlling for variables, pregnant women who changed their perinatal checkup institution due to medical indication were significantly associated with shorter gestational duration (beta = -10.6, P < 0.001) and preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio, 8.5; 95% confidence interval, 5.8-12.5) compared with women who visited only one institution. Self-referral, however, was not significantly associated with the outcomes.
   Conclusion: According to prenatal checkup status, our results suggest that the effect on gestational duration of the Great East Japan Earthquake and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was not significant.

AB  - The massive evacuation of sick and at-risk infants from a large metropolitan area following a natural disaster provides many lessons for neonatal nurses. Planning and education are of utmost importance, and disaster education and training are essential for all nurses. Unit-specific disaster plans can serve as a guide for nurses but the real test occurs during and after the event. Nurses must learn to adapt neonatal care to the rapidly changing environment during a disaster. Supporting high-risk infants without the aid of technology requires a back-to-the-basics approach. The ability to maintain communication and facilitate transportation of neonates out of a disaster area is essential. Nurses must also consider their own well-being in the aftermath of a disaster. Planning for future disasters should include lessons learned from the past events. This article addresses nursing care issues and lessons learned from the events that unfolded in the New Orleans area neonatal units during and after Hurricane Katrina, and guidance in support of disaster education for neonatal nurses.

AB  - BackgroundOn May 3, 2016, residents of Fort McMurray Wood Buffalo, Alberta were evacuated due to an uncontrolled wildfire. The short-notice evacuation had destabilizing consequences for residents, including changes in routines, loss of control, and increased uncertainty. These consequences were especially detrimental to women who were pregnant or pre-conception during the evacuation. Pregnant and pre-conception women are particularly susceptible to a vast range of negative consequences during and post natural disasters, including elevated stress and higher incidence of pregnancy complications including gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy induced hypertension and C-section. The aim of this study was to understand the experiences, perceived stress and resilience of women who were pregnant during the wildfire. As well as to explore potential interventions to promote the health and enhance resilience of pregnant women and to assist in recovery after exposure to a natural disaster or other traumatic events. MethodsA qualitative thematic analysis of 16 narratives penned by pregnant women and recounted in Ashley Tobin's compilations 93/88,000 and 159 More/ 88,000: Stories of Evacuation, Re-Entry and the In-Between was conducted. ResultsAnalysis revealed five key themes: (1) experience of stress responses due to personal and external factors, (2) social connectedness and support as a facilitator of resilience, (3) performance of resilience-enhancing activities, (4) the roles of pregnancy and motherhood in the experiences of loss and resilience, and (5) the importance of home. ConclusionPregnant women have unique barriers that may negatively impact them during a natural disaster or other form of stressful event. They may benefit from assistance with navigating role transition during pregnancy, training in stress management strategies, and writing interventions to build resiliency and begin the process of recovery from trauma.

AB  - Background As extreme events such as drought and flood are projected to increase in frequency and intensity under climate change, there is still large missing evidence on how drought exposure potentially impacts mortality among young children. This study aimed to investigate the association between drought and risk of infant mortality in Africa, a region highly vulnerable to climate change that bears the heaviest share of the global burden.Methods and findings In this cross-sectional study, we obtained data on infant mortality in 34 African countries during 1992-2019 from the Demographic and Health Surveys program. We measured drought by the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index at a timescale of 24 months and a spatial resolution of 10 x 10 km, which was further dichotomized into mild and severe drought. The association between drought exposure and infant mortality risk was estimated using Cox regression models allowing time-dependent covariates. We further examined whether the association varied for neonatal and post-neonatal mortality and whether there was a delayed association with drought exposure during pregnancy or infancy. The mean (standard deviation) number of months in which children experienced any drought during pregnancy and survival period (from birth through death before 1 year of age) was 4.6 (5.2) and 7.3 (7.4) among cases and non-cases, respectively. Compared to children who did not experience drought, we did not find evidence that any drought exposure was associated with an increased risk of infant mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.00, 1.04], p = 0.072). When stratified by drought severity, we found a statistically significant association with severe drought (HR: 1.04; 95% CI [1.01, 1.07], p = 0.015), but no significant association with mild drought (HR: 1.01; 95% CI [0.99, 1.03], p = 0.353), compared to non-exposure to any drought. However, when excluding drought exposure during pregnancy, the association with severe drought was found to be non-significant. In addition, an increased risk of neonatal mortality was associated with severe drought (HR: 1.05; 95% CI [1.01, 1.10], p = 0.019), but not with mild drought (HR: 0.99; 95% CI [0.96, 1.02], p = 0.657).Methods and findings In this cross-sectional study, we obtained data on infant mortality in 34 African countries during 1992-2019 from the Demographic and Health Surveys program. We measured drought by the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index at a timescale of 24 months and a spatial resolution of 10 x 10 km, which was further dichotomized into mild and severe drought. The association between drought exposure and infant mortality risk was estimated using Cox regression models allowing time-dependent covariates. We further examined whether the association varied for neonatal and post-neonatal mortality and whether there was a delayed association with drought exposure during pregnancy or infancy.

When stratified by drought severity, we found a statistically significant association with severe drought (HR: 1.04; 95% CI [1.01, 1.
   07], p = 0.015), but no significant association with mild drought (HR: 1.01; 95% CI [0.99, 1.03], p = 0.353), compared to non-exposure to any drought. However, when excluding drought exposure during pregnancy, the association with severe drought was found to be non-significant. In addition, an increased risk of neonatal mortality was associated with severe drought (HR: 1.05; 95% CI [1.01, 1.10], p = 0.019), but not with mild drought (HR: 0.99; 95% CI [0.96, 1.02], p = 0.657).Conclusions Exposure to long-term severe drought was associated with increased infant mortality risk in Africa. Our findings urge more effective adaptation measures and alleviation strategies against the adverse impact of drought on child health.

AB  - Background: Earthquakes and other catastrophic events frequently occurring worldwide can be considered as outliers and cause a growing and urgent need to improve our understanding of the negative effects imposed by such disasters. Earthquakes can intensively impact the birth outcomes upon psychological and morphological development of the unborn children, albeit detailed characteristics remain obscure.
   Methods and Findings: We utilized the birth records at Du Jiang Yan and Peng Zhou counties to investigate the birth outcomes as a consequence of a major earthquake occurred in Wenchuan, China on May 12, 2008. Totally 13,003 of neonates were recorded, with 6638 and 6365 for pre- and post-earthquake, respectively. Significant low birthweight, high ratio of low birthweight, and low Apgar scores of post-earthquake group were observed. In contrast, the sex ratio at birth, birth length and length of gestation did not show statistical differences. The overall ratio of birth-defect in the post-earthquake (1.18%) is statistically high than that of pre- earthquake (0.99%), especially for those in the first trimester on earthquake day (1.47%). The birth-defect spectrum was dramatically altered after earthquake, with the markedly increased occurrences of ear malformations. The ratio of preterm birth post-earthquake (7.41%) is significant increased than that of pre- earthquake (5.63%). For the birth outcomes of twins, significant differences of the ratio of twins, birth weight, ratio of low birthweight and birth-defect rate were observed after earthquake.
   Conclusion: A hospital-based study of birth outcomes impacted by the Wenchuan earthquake shows that the earthquake was associated with significant effects on birth outcomes, indicating it is a major monitor for long-term pregnant outcomes.

AB  - BackgroundClimate change is a growing threat to human health, particularly in regions facing overlapping environmental hazards and social inequities. Puerto Rico-a U.S. territory with a colonial history-offers a unique case for examining how multiple disasters, including Hurricane Maria, ongoing earthquakes, and the COVID-19 pandemic, interact with structural vulnerabilities to affect maternal and child health. Despite increasing attention to climate-related health outcomes, little is known about the reproductive health impacts of cumulative disaster exposure in colonial contexts.MethodsWe used U.S. National Vital Statistics System data (2017-2021) to assess associations between disaster exposure and six maternal and newborn outcomes: preterm birth, low birthweight, term low birthweight, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, and excessive weight gain. Disaster exposure was defined based on the timing of hurricanes and the pandemic, using a three-month lag period. We analyzed data from Puerto Rico and used Florida and Texas as comparison sites. Multivariable log-binomial regression models estimated adjusted prevalence ratios. Effect modification was tested for (1) region within Puerto Rico and (2) colonial status, comparing Puerto Rico (territory) to Florida and Texas (states). Simulations were conducted to account for potential live-birth bias.ResultsAcross 104,560 births in Puerto Rico, disaster periods were consistently associated with worse maternal health outcomes. For example, during the late post-hurricane period, gestational diabetes increased (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31), while term low birthweight surprisingly appeared to decline (RR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.98). Associations with newborn health were mixed and may have been underestimated due to sharp declines in live births after disasters. Simulations suggested stronger disaster-related risks than observed in primary analyses. Effect modification by region and colonial status showed inconsistent but notable differences, particularly elevated maternal health risks in certain regions of Puerto Rico and compared to U.S. states.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that multiple disasters negatively affect reproductive health in Puerto Rico and that structural factors, including colonialism, may exacerbate these impacts. Public health responses must account for cumulative disaster exposure and systemic inequities to better support maternal and child health in marginalized settings, especially as climate change continues to intensify.

AB  - The Pregnancy and Birth Survey was started by Fukushima Medical University as part of the Fukushima Health Management Survey in 2011 in order to assess the physical and mental health of mothers and provide parenting support (telephone counseling) for those in need. The present study reviewed the major findings from 4 annual surveys conducted from 2011 to 2014. Overall proportions of preterm deliveries, low birth weight infants, and congenital anomalies in the first year were almost the same as those in national surveillance data. The prevalence of depressive symptoms among the mothers held steady at about 25% over the 4 years. Regarding the content of parenting counseling, the proportion of mothers who voiced concerns about radiation decreased each year. This survey should be continued to provide support to mothers in Fukushima.

AB  - Prescribed burning is used for reducing future wildfire risk; however, it creates smoke, which can affect human health. Using newly available high-frequency daily data (2015-2017) on PM2.5 specifically attributed to smoke from prescribed burns in Georgia, USA, this analysis investigates infant health externalities connected to these burns. Cumulatively, over an average pregnancy, smoke from prescribed burns is associated with a 1.02 percentage point increase in instances of low birth weight and prematurity, each. For every $1 spent on prescribed burning, $0.43-$2.46 in state-wide low birth weight and prematurity hospitalization costs are created. Various robustness and specification checks are performed.(JELQ23, Q53, Q51, I18, J13)

AB  - Purpose of ReviewWildfire smoke is associated with human health, becoming an increasing public health concern. However, a comprehensive synthesis of the current evidence on the health impacts of ambient wildfire smoke on children and adolescents, an exceptionally vulnerable population, is lacking. We conduct a systematic review of peer-reviewed epidemiological studies on the association between wildfire smoke and health of children and adolescents.Recent FindingsWe searched for studies available in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus from database inception up to October 11, 2022. Of 4926 studies initially identified, 59 studies from 14 countries were ultimately eligible. Over 33.3% of the studies were conducted in the USA, and two focused on multi-countries. The exposure assessment of wildfire smoke was heterogenous, with wildfire-specific particulate matters with diameters <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5, 22.0%) and all-source (22.0%) PM2.5 during wildfire period most frequently used. Over half of studies (50.6%) focused on respiratory-related morbidities/mortalities. Wildfire smoke exposure was consistently associated with enhanced risks of adverse health outcomes in children/adolescents. Meta-analysis results presented a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.12) for all-cause respiratory morbidity, 1.11 (95% Ci: 0.93-1.32) for asthma, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85-1.03) for bronchitis, and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.05-1.23) for upper respiratory infection, whilst - 21.71 g for birth weight (95% CI, - 32.92 to - 10.50) per 10 mu g/m3 increment in wildfire-specific PM2.5/all-source PM2.5 during wildfire event.SummaryThe majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with multiple adverse health outcomes among children and adolescents, with respiratory morbidities of significant concern. In-utero exposure to wildfire smoke may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes and have long-term impacts on height. Higher maternal baseline exposure to wildfire smoke and poor family-level baseline birthweight respectively elevated risks in preterm birth and low birth weight associated with wildfire smoke. More studies in low- and middle-income countries and focusing on extremely young children are needed. Despite technological progress, wildfire smoke exposure measurements remain uncertain, demanding improved methodologies to have more precise assessment of wildfire smoke levels and thus quantify the corresponding health impacts and guide public mitigation actions.

AB  - Importance Climate change is affecting the earth, resulting in more extreme temperatures and weather, rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and displacement of populations of plants and animals, including people and insects. These changes affect food and housing security, vector-borne illnesses, and access to clean air and water, all of which influence human health.Evidence and Results There are a number of adverse health outcomes linked to heat, air pollution from wildfires, stress from natural disasters, and other elements of climate change. Pregnant people are especially vulnerable to the health harms resulting from climate change, namely, preterm birth, small for gestational age, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and other adverse reproductive health and birth outcomes. Strategies to minimize these harms include mitigation and adaptation.Conclusions and Relevance Physicians are in a unique position to protect the health of pregnant persons and children by advocating for policy changes that address climate change and providing clinical recommendations for patients to protect themselves from the health impacts of climate hazards.Target Audience Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians.Learning objectives After participating in this activity, physicians should be better able to describe the adverse health effects and pregnancy outcomes associated with elements of climate change; and identify strategies for patients to minimize the health harms from climate change, including mitigation, adaptations, and building resilience.

AB  - Although the earth's climate has been continuously changing over billions of years, human influence has accelerated that rate of change. While high latitudes suffer the greatest increase in incremental temperature, moderate latitudes are highly vulnerable due to their temperate/tropical rain storms and hurricanes that bring about extreme flooding events. We and others have shown that there is a link between the occurrence and severity of these climate events and risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. In this review, we will discuss the data and consider interacting near and intermediate sequelae of worsening natural disasters-including food scarcity, disrupted or compromised built environments and infrastructure, and loss of communities with human migration. While certainly tackling these and other proximal mediators of adverse perinatal outcomes will benefit maternal and child health, a failure to meaningfully address the root causes of climate change and resultant environmental chemical exposures will be of little long-term benefit.

AB  - A growing body of research highlights that in utero conditions are consequential for individual outcomes throughout the life cycle, but research assessing causal processes is scarce. This article examines the effect of one such condition-prenatal maternal stress-on birth weight, an early outcome shown to affect cognitive, educational, and socioeconomic attainment later in life. Exploiting a major earthquake as a source of acute stress and using a difference-in-difference methodology, I find that maternal exposure to stress results in a significant decline in birth weight and an increase in the proportion of low birth weight. This effect is focused on the first trimester of gestation, and it is mediated by reduced gestational age rather than by factors affecting the intrauterine growth of term infants. The findings highlight the relevance of understanding the early emergence of unequal outcomes and of investing in maternal well-being since the onset of pregnancy.

AB  - Objective: Maternal health in pregnancy and birth outcomes were compared between pre- and post-Varzaghan earthquake. Methods: In this retrospective descriptive study, before and after the earthquake, 550 and 450 women were enrolled respectively. Neonatal weight, height, and head circumference, as well as maternal weight gain and hemoglobin (Hb) levels were obtained using medical records at health centers. Chi-square test and Independent t-test were used to analyze differences in pregnancy outcomes. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: A significant increase in inadequate gestational weight gain (44.1% vs 58.9%) was observed (P = 0.043) before and after the earthquake. The mean hemoglobin level in the first trimester before the earthquake was significantly higher than after the earthquake (P = 0.001). Before-after earthquake comparisons showed that the mean birth weight, birth height, and birth head circumference were decreased significantly (P < 0.05). In addition, the rates of preterm birth (18.91% vs 10.90%), abortion (17.11% vs 10.54%), and stillbirth (3.78% vs 1.82%) were increased significantly after the earthquake (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Earthquake causes inadequate gestational weight gain and decreased hemoglobin levels, which lead to adverse birth outcomes. More longitudinal and well-designed studies are desired to investigate the longitudinal consequences of disasters on susceptible groups.

AB  - Aim: National medical projects are carried out according to medical care plans directed by theMedical Care Act of Japan. In order to improve Japanese perinatal medical care, it is necessary to determine the factors that might influence perinatal outcome. Methods: Statistical data of births and perinatal deathswere obtained for allmunicipalities in Japan from 2008 to 2012 from the Portal Site of Official Statistics of Japan (e-Stat). The perinatal mortality of all 349 Japanese secondarymedical care zoneswas calculated. The number of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), maternal-fetal intensive care units (MFICUs), pediatricians and obstetricians in 2011 were also obtained from e-Stat. Nine secondary medical care zones in two prefectures, Fukushima (7) and Miyagi (2) were excluded to eliminate the influence of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Results: The 340 secondary medical care zones were divided into three groups according to population size and density: metropolis, provincial city, and depopulation. The number of secondary medical care zones in each group were 52, 168, and 120, respectively. The secondarymedical care zones in the depopulation group had fewer pediatricians and significantly fewer NICUs andMFICUs than the metropolis group, but there was no significant difference in perinatal mortality. The only independent risk factor for high perinatal mortality, determined by multivariable analysis, was the absence of an NICU (P = 0.011). Conclusions: To consider directions in perinatal medical care, planned arrangement and appropriate access to NICUs is indispensable.

AB  - Objective: The Great East Japan Earthquake and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster occurred on 11 March 2011. We investigated the incidence of SGA (small for gestational age) in the Fukushima Prefecture in newborns delivered by women who were pregnant at the time of the disasters and identified any risk factors for SGA.
   Methods: Subjects were women who were pregnant at the time of the disasters. Questionnaires were sent to the women who lived in the Hamadori area (seaside and near to the nuclear power plant) at the time of the disasters as well as to a control group of women who lived outside the Hamadori area. The incidence of SGA was compared. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for SGA.
   Results: In total, 325(5.6%) women had infants with SGA. Neither area nor the trimester of pregnancy at the time of the disasters influenced the incidence of SGA. Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) was higher in the SGA group. PIH was found to be an independent risk factor for SGA.
   Conclusion: We found no evidence that the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster increased the incidence of SGA in the Fukushima Prefecture.

AB  - Background The majority of research documenting the public health impacts of natural disasters focuses on the well-being of adults and their living children. Negative effects may also occur in the unborn, exposed to disaster stressors when critical organ systems are developing and when the consequences of exposure are large.
   Methods We exploit spatial and temporal variation in hurricane behaviour as a quasi-experimental design to assess whether fetal death is dose-responsive in the extent of hurricane damage. Data on births and fetal deaths are merged with Parish-level housing wreckage data. Fetal outcomes are regressed on housing wreckage adjusting for the maternal, fetal, placental and other risk factors. The average causal effect of maternal exposure to hurricane destruction is captured by difference-indifferences analyses.
   Results The adjusted odds of fetal death are 1.40 (1.07-1.83) and 2.37 (1.684-3.327) times higher in parishes suffering 10-50% and >50% wreckage to housing stock, respectively. For every 1% increase in the destruction of housing stock, we observe a 1.7% (1.1-2.4%) increase in fetal death. Of the 410 officially recorded fetal deaths in these parishes, between 117 and 205 may be attributable to hurricane destruction and postdisaster disorder. The estimated fetal death toll is 17.4-30.6% of the human death toll.
   Conclusions The destruction caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita imposed significant measurable losses in terms of fetal death. Postdisaster migratory dynamics suggest that the reported effects of maternal exposure to hurricane destruction on fetal death may be conservative.

AB  - NICU patients are among those potentially most vulnerable to the effects of natural or man-made disaster on a medical center. The published data on evacuations of NICU patients in the setting of disaster are sparse. In October of 2012, New York University Langone Medical Center was evacuated during Hurricane Sandy in the setting of a power outage secondary to a coastal surge. In this setting, 21 neonates were safely evacuated from the medical center's NICU to receiving hospitals within New York City in a span of 4.5 hours. Using data recorded during the evacuation and from staff debriefings, we describe the challenges faced and lessons learned during both the power outage and vertical evacuation. From our experience, we identify several elements that are important to the functioning of an NICU in a disaster or to an evacuation that may be incorporated into future NICU-focused disaster planning. These include a clear command structure, backups (personnel, communication, medical information, and equipment), establishing situational awareness, regional coordination, and flexibility as well as special attention to families and to the availability of neonatal transport resources.

AB  - Health care services in developing countries are being challenged by high childhood mortality rates. Although there have been tremendous strides made in reducing infant mortality rates largely due to vaccinations and improved standards of living, a lot remains to be done to reduce neonatal mortality. Achievement of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) number 4 on childhood mortality will remain unattainable in most developing countries unless purpose based interventions targeted at reducing neonatal mortality are instituted. This viewpoint is based on the experiences gained in Eritrea, a country that gained independence less than twenty years ago following a protracted war that left a trail of destruction of infrastructure in general and health facilities in particular. War that broke out with Ethiopia less than 10 years into its independence and border conflicts followed by a no peace no war stalemate situation aggravated by frequent droughts have continued to throttle economic recovery, reconstruction and rehabilitative efforts. The population is estimated at 3.5 million comprising of nine ethnic groups who speak different languages. The country has a surface area of 124 000 km(2) which shares borders with Sudan, Ethiopia, Djibouti and the Red Sea.
   Conclusion: Attainment of the MDG number 4 on reduction of childhood mortality can be achieved by addressing morbidities of the neonate where the bottle neck currently appears to be sited.

AB  - Field hospitals were deployed by the Israel Defense Forces as part of the international relief efforts after major seismic events, one in Haiti (2010) and one in Japan (2011). The teams treated a total of 44 pregnant and 24 nonpregnant women and performed 16 deliveries and three cesarean deliveries under extreme conditions. Half of all deliveries were complicated by preeclampsia and 31% were preterm (at 30-32 weeks of gestation). It is imperative that obstetrician-gynecologists be included among humanitarian aid delegations sent to sites of natural disasters. The complicated cases we encountered required highly skilled obstetricians and led to a shortage of specific medications for these women. Cases that would have been considered routine under normal conditions created unanticipated ethical and practical issues in the face of very limited resources. The aim of this commentary is to share the experiences and lessons learned by our field hospital obstetrics and gynecology teams after the major earthquakes in Haiti and Japan. We present what we consider to be the 10 most important lessons learned and propose that they serve as guidelines in preparing for essential needs in other natural disaster settings.

AB  - Preterm birth (PTB) complications are the leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age, responsible for approximately 1 million deaths in 2015, according to the World Health Organization. Those infants born prematurely who survived the first 5 years, studies suggest that these infants are more likely to experience a range of poor health outcomes during childhood and even adulthood. Wildfire smoke has been suggested as a type of air pollution source with high toxicity for reproductive health. In this study, we estimated the association between preterm birth and wildfire periods in Brazil, a country included in the list of the 10 nations with the greatest number of preterm birth and also considered as a very fire-prone region. We applied a time-stratified case-crossover study design using conditional logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratio for preterm birth associated with wildfire-related prenatal PM2.5, during different windows of exposure, including trimesters 1-3. After adjusting for several confounders (other air pollutants, demographics, meteorological variables, and spatiotemporal terms), we found that wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy may be associated with preterm birth in Brazil. Southeast was the region with the highest increase in the odds of PTB (OR:1.41 (95%CI: 1.31-1.51) when the exposure occurred in the first trimester. In the North, exposure to PM2.5 & nbsp;during wildfire periods in the second trimester of pregnancy was associated with increased odds of PTB (OR:1.05 (95%CI: 1.01-1.09) in preterm birth when the exposure occurred in the second trimester. This study suggests that wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy may increase the risk for preterm birth in Brazil. This should be of great concern to the public health authorities, obstetricians, and policymakers.

AB  - In January 2014, Freedom Industries spilled 4-methylcyclohexylmethanol, a chemical foaming agent used in coal processing, from a storage facility into the Elk River in West Virginia. This chemical spill, one of the most significant in U.S. history, adversely affected the drinking water supply of over 300,000 individuals in the Charleston, West Virginia Metropolitan area. We use synthetic control methods to estimate the casual effects on macro-economic growth and infant health outcomes from this water crisis. We find a significant decrease in 5-minute Apgar Scores, a measure of how babies fare in the birthing process and outside of the womb, after the chemical spill. We do not find significant effects for infant birthweight or gestational age. We find a statistically insignificant decrease of per capita GDP in the Charlestown, West Virginia area compared to the synthetic control of 3% two years after the chemical spill.

AB  - Background: The effect of natural disasters on secondary sex ratio (SSR) and perinatal outcomes has been suggested. This study aimed to examine effects of the Great East Japan Earthquake on perinatal outcomes using vital statistics of Japan.
   Methods: Birth registration data from vital statistics of Japan between March 2010 and March 2012 were used. Pregnant women who experienced the earthquake were categorized according to their gestational period as of March 11, 2011, as follows: gestational weeks 4-11, 12-19, 20-27, and 28-36 (2011 group). Similarly, pregnant women who did not experience the earthquake were categorized according to their gestational period as of March 11, 2010 and used as controls (2010 group). We also categorized prefectures as "extremely affected", "moderately affected", and "slightly or unaffected" regions. SSR, birth weight, and gestational period were compared between both groups.
   Results: The number of singleton births was 688 479 in the 2010 group and 679 131 in the 2011 group. In the extremely affected region, the SSR among women at 4-11 weeks of gestation was significantly lower in the 2011 group compared with the 2010 group (49.8% vs 52.1%, P = 0.009). In the extremely affected region, children born to women who experienced the earthquake at 28-36 weeks of gestation had significantly lower birth weights.
   Conclusions: The SSR declined among women who experienced the earthquake during early pregnancy, particularly in the extremely affected region. However, no apparent negative effect of the earthquake on perinatal outcomes was observed, although birth weight of infants who were born to women who experienced the earthquake at 28-36 weeks of gestation were lower.

AB  - Objective To examine associations between prenatal wildfire smoke exposure and neonatal outcomes. Design Population-based retrospective analysis. Setting Washington State. Participants Data from 526,649 live births between 2010 and 2018. Methods We used pooled cross-sectional birth records data with computed number of wildfire smoke days to examine effects of prenatal exposure on gestational age at birth, birth weight, Apgar scores, and NICU admissions using regression analysis. Results We found small increases in gestational age with wildfire smoke exposure in trimester 1 (B = 0.003, 95% CI [.003, .004], p < .001), trimester 3 (B = 0.011, 95% CI [.011, .012], p < .001), and across pregnancy (B = 0.003, 95% CI [.003, .004], p < .001), and a small decrease in trimester 2 (B = -0.002, 95% CI [-.002, .002], p < .001). We observed small increases in birth weight with exposure in trimester 2 (B = 0.303, 95% CI [.201, .405], p < .001) and across pregnancy (B = 0.148, 95% CI = [.086, .210], p < .001). No differences were found for Apgar scores. Finally, we found a 0.003% increase in NICU admissions with exposure in trimesters 1 and 2 (OR = 1.00, 95% CI [1.002, 1.004], [1.001,1.004], respectively) and a 0.002% increase with exposure across pregnancy (OR = 1.002, 95% CI [1.001, 1.003]). Conclusion Prenatal exposure to wildfire smoke had limited effects on neonatal outcomes. Although associations with gestational age and birth weight aligned with prior studies, our findings were not clinically meaningful.

AB  - We conduct the first empirical study to examine the health impact of long commutes to work during pregnancy on fetuses and infants at birth, using unique data that contain information on not only a woman's home address but also her employer's address during pregnancy, which allows us to calculate the maternal travel distance during pregnancy. Our study contributes to the literature on the relationship between maternal stress during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes by focusing on the understudied chronic stress induced by long commutes, rather than the stress triggered by a one-time significant event, such as a natural disaster. We find that among long-distance commuters, increasing the maternal travel distance during pregnancy by 10 miles is associated with increases in the probabilities of low birth weight and intrauterine growth restriction by 0.9 and 0.6 percentage points, respectively. In addition to the maternal stress induced by long commutes being one potential biological mechanism, we find suggestive evidence showing that maternal long commutes during pregnancy are also associated with under-utilization of prenatal care.

AB  - Background: Maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy is associated with adverse birth outcomes, although less is known for wildfire smoke. This systematic review evaluated the association between maternal exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy and the risk of perinatal, obstetric, and early childhood health outcomes. Methods: We searched CINAHL Complete, Ovid/EMBASE, Ovid/MEDLINE, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant epidemiological observational studies indexed through September 2023. The screening of titles, abstracts, and full-texts, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment was performed by pairs of independent reviewers.Results: Our systematic search yielded 28,549 records. After duplicate removal, we screened 14,009 studies, identifying 31 for inclusion in the present review. Data extraction highlighted high methodological heterogeneity between studies, including a lack of geographic variation. Approximately 56.5% and 16% originated in the United States and Brazil, respectively, and fewer in other countries. Among the studies, wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy was assessed using distance of residence from wildfire-affected areas (n = 15), measurement of air pollutant concentration during wildfires (n = 11), number of wildfire records (n = 3), aerosol index (n = 1), and geographic hot spots (n = 1). Pooled meta-analysis for birthweight and low birthweight were inconclusive, likely due to low number of methodologically homogenous studies. However, the reviewed studies provided suggestive evidence for an increased risk of birthweight reduction, low birthweight, preterm birth, and other adverse health outcomes.Conclusions: This review identified 31 studies evaluating the impacts of maternal wildfire smoke exposure on maternal, infant, and child health. Although we found suggestive evidence of harm from exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy, more methodologically homogenous studies are required to enable future meta -analysis with greater statistical power to more accurately evaluate the association between maternal wildfire smoke and adverse birth outcomes and other health outcomes.

The Birth File data were merged with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection data of the same year. Spina bifida was identified by its corresponding ICD-9 code listed on the hospital discharge of the newborn. Wildfire exposure was determined based on the zip code of the woman's home address. Pregnancy was considered exposed to wildfire if the mother lived within 15 miles of a wildfire during the pregnancy or within 30 days prior to pregnancy.ResultsThere were 2,093,185 births and 659 cases of spina bifida between 2007 and 2010. The births were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression models and adjusted for potential confounders. Exposure to wildfire in the first trimester was associated with higher odds of spina bifida (aOR= 1.43 [1.11-1.84], p-value = 0.01). Wildfire exposure 30 days before the last menstrual period and during the second and third trimesters were not associated with higher spina bifida risk.ConclusionWildfire exposure has shown an increased risk of spina bifida during the early stages of pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: National second-trimester scanning of cervical length was introduced in Israel in 2010, and in the decade thereafter, a significant systematic reduction in preterm birth and in the delivery of low birth weight babies was found among singletons.
   OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a national policy mandating second-trimester cervical length screening by ultrasound, followed by vaginal progesterone treatment for short cervical length in comparison with no screening strategy.
   STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a decision model comparing 2 strategies, namely (1) universal cervical length screening, and (2) no screening strategy. This study used the national delivery registry of Israel's Ministry of Health. All women diagnosed with a second-trimester cervical length <25 mm were treated with vaginal progesterone and were monitored with a bimonthly ultrasound scan for cervical dynamics and threat of early delivery. Preterm birth prevalence associated with short cervical length, the efficacy of progesterone in preterm birth prevention, and the accuracy of cervical length measurements were derived from previous studies. The cost of progesterone and bimonthly sonographic surveillance, low birthweight delivery, newborn admission to intensive care units, the first-year costs of managing preterm birth and low birthweight, and instances of handicaps and the cost of their follow-up were extracted from the publicly posted registry of Israel's Ministry of Health and Israel Social Securities data. Monte Carlo simulations decision tree mode, Tornado diagrams, and 1 and 2-way sensitivity analyses were implemented and the base case and sensitivity to parameters that were predicted to influence cost-effectiveness were calculated.
   RESULTS: Without cervical length screening, the discounted quality-adjusted life years were 30.179, and with universal cervical length screening, it increased to 30.198 (difference of 0.018 quality-adjusted life years). The average cost of no screening for cervical length strategy was $1047, and for universal cervical length screening, it was reduced to $998. The calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was -$2676 per quality-adjusted life year (dividing the difference in costs by the difference in quality-adjusted life years). Monte Carlo simulation of cervical length screening of 170,000 singleton newborns (rounded large number close to the number of singleton newborns in Israel) showed that 95.17% of all babies were delivered at gestational week >= 37 in comparison with 94.46% of babies with the no screening strategy. Given 170,000 singleton births, the national savings of screening for short cervical length when compared with no cervical length screening amounted to $8.31M annually, equating to $48.84 for a base case, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each case of low birthweight or very low birthweight avoided was -$14,718. A cervical length <25 mm was measured for 30,090 women, and of those, 24,650 were false positives. The major parameters that affected the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were the incidence of preterm birth, the specificity of cervical length measurements, and the efficacy of progesterone treatment. At a preterm birth incidence of <3%, universal screening does not lead to a cost saving.
   CONCLUSION: National universal cervical length screening should be incorporated into the routine anomaly scan in the second trimester, because it leads to a drop in the incidence of preterm birth and low birth weight babies in singleton pregnancies, thereby saving costs related to the newborn and gaining quality-adjusted life years.

   Study Design: A clinical retrospective survey.
   Result: Five hundred and twenty-four women were lost to follow-up, and data from the remaining 1770 women were analyzed. The completed questionnaires revealed that 80.11% (1418/1770) became pregnant following IUD removal and about 88% (1256) of whom conceived within 1 year. Among women with different durations of IUD use, pregnancy rates and miscarriage rates were as follows: <5 years, 89.77% and 4.27%; 6-10 years, 81.10% and 10.19%; and >10 years, 75.20% and 12.98%, respectively. Age, duration of IUD use, a history of a previous miscarriage and abnormal menstruation before the earthquake were independently associated with reduced fertility, but a higher gravidity pre-earthquake was associated with a higher conception rate.
   Conclusion: Long-term IUD use in older women had a high rate of pregnancy after removal of IUD, but with an increased risk of fertility problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between Hurricane Harvey landfall with maternal and neonatal morbidity.
   METHODS: Using an institutional perinatal database from two hospitals in Houston, Texas, women with nonanomalous singletons delivering after 24 weeks of gestation between August 2011 and June 2018 were included. To evaluate the possible association of hurricane landfall with pregnancy outcomes, gravid women delivering within 280 days (40 weeks of gestation) on or after August 25, 2017 (the day of hurricane landfall) were categorized as exposed, and women who delivered before August 25, 2017, were the reference group. Composite maternal morbidity included any of the following: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, chorioamnionitis, endometritis, blood transfusion, peripartum hysterectomy, maternal critical care admission, pulmonary edema, or maternal death. Composite neonatal morbidity included any of the following: 5-minute Apgar score 3 or less, respiratory distress syndrome, use of ventilator or continuous positive airway pressure, suspected newborn sepsis, seizure, stillbirth, or neonatal death. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated after correcting for possible confounders identified on univariate analysis. Disruption in outcome trends were measured in time series analyses.
   RESULTS: Of 40,502 deliveries in our database, 29,179 (72%) met the inclusion criteria, with 3,842 (13.2%) delivering within 280 days of Hurricane Harvey landfall. Women delivering after Hurricane Harvey were on average less likely to be obese and more likely to be older, Caucasian, married, have a household income higher than $75,000, a high school education, and private insurance. However, compared with the cohort of gravid patients who delivered before Hurricane Harvey, composite maternal morbidity increased by 27% (11.5% vs 14.7%, aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.14-1.42) after the storm. Composite neonatal morbidity increased by 50% (7.8% vs 11.9%, aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.34-1.71). In time series analyses, we observed a significant shift in composite maternal morbidity specific to women of low socioeconomic status (estimate 2.87, P=.028).
   CONCLUSION: Despite having fewer at-risk baseline characteristics, gravid patients delivering after landfall by Hurricane Harvey had a significantly higher likelihood of adverse outcomes as did their neonates.

AB  - Background
   Natural disasters increase the level population stress, including pregnant women, who can experience prenatal maternal stress, affecting the fetus and triggering perinatal complications, such as low birth weight, smaller head circumference, etc. However, little is known about effects of earthquake on perinatal outcomes.
   Objective
   To evaluate the effect of earthquake occurred on February 27, 2010 and perinatal outcomes of Chilean pregnant women, and to examine these effects by timing of exposure during pregnancy and newborn gender.
   Methods
   A register-based study was performed using data collected from women who had a vaginal delivery in a large private health center in Santiago, Chile, during 2009 and 2010. The study population was categorized according to exposure to earthquake and timing during gestation. Primary perinatal outcomes were gestational age at birth, birth weight, length and head circumference. Analyses adjusted for gender, gestational age at exposure, parity, maternal age and income.
   Results
   A total of 1,966 eligible vaginal deliveries occurred during 2009 and 2,110 in 2010. Birth weight was not affected by the trimester of exposure; however, length, head circumference and gestational age at birth were significantly different according to trimester of exposure and gender of newborn. In multivariable analysis, newborns were shorter by 2 mm, 5 mm and 4.5 mm, if they were exposed during their first, second and third trimester, respectively. Furthermore, newborns had a smaller head circumference by 1.2 mm and 1.5 mm if they were exposed during first and second trimester of gestation.
   Conclusion
   In this cohort, exposure to the February 2010 earthquake resulted in earlier delivery and reduced length and head circumference in the offspring. This association varied according to trimester of exposure and fetal gender. Health workers should include exposed to high levels of stress associated with natural disasters when assessing pregnancy risk factors.

AB  - Biomass combustion, including wildfires and residential wood burning, is a significant source of particulate matter (PM2.5) in Australia, with potentially distinct health effects due to its unique chemical composition. This study aimed to quantify the association between exposure to ambient biomass-attributable PM2.5 and the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth across pregnancy windows in Sydney, Australia, from 2010 to 2020. We conducted case-control studies nested within a cohort of 578,391 singleton pregnancies, including 29,954 preterm births and 2,928 stillbirths. Controls were randomly selected using risk-set sampling. Daily all-source PM2.5 estimates at a 5 km resolution were obtained from a previous study. Days exceeding the 95th percentile of all-source PM2.5 at statistical area level 4 without significant dust storm pollution were classified as biomass-affected days. For these days, biomass-attributable PM2.5 was estimated using the remainder component from a seasonal trend decomposition, with the seasonal and trend components representing nonbiomass-attributable PM2.5. Conditional logistic regressions were used to analyze associations between biomass-attributable PM2.5 exposure and outcomes, adjusting for area-level socioeconomic factors, temperature, humidity, and temporal and seasonal trends. The odds ratio for preterm birth per interquartile range increase in biomass-attributable PM2.5 was 1.002 (95% CI = 0.997, 1.007) for the entire pregnancy average exposure, with similar null results across trimesters. For stillbirth, the odds ratio was 1.002 (95% CI = 0.985, 1.019) for the entire pregnancy average exposure, with comparable null findings across trimesters. These results suggest that in Sydney, biomass-attributable PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy may not increase the risk of preterm births or stillbirths.

AB  - A growing literature suggests that stressful events in pregnancy can have negative effects on birth outcomes. Some of the estimates in this literature may be affected by small samples, omitted variables, endogenous mobility in response to disasters, and errors in the measurement of gestation, as well as by a mechanical correlation between longer gestation and the probability of having been exposed. We use millions of individual birth records to examine the effects of exposure to hurricanes during pregnancy, and the sensitivity of the estimates to these econometric problems. We find that exposure to a hurricane during pregnancy increases the probability of abnormal conditions of the newborn such as being on a ventilator more than 30 min and meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Although we are able to reproduce previous estimates of effects on birth weight and gestation, our results suggest that measured effects of stressful events on these outcomes are sensitive to specification and it is preferable to use more sensitive indicators of newborn health.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In April 2000, a series of wildfires occurred simultaneously in five adjacent small cities located on the eastern coast of Korea. These wildfires burned approximately 23,794 hectares of forestland over several days. We investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to the by-products generated by wildfire disasters on birth weight. METHODS: Birth weight data were obtained for 1999-2001 from the birth registration database of the Korean National Statis-tical Office and matched with the zip code and exposed/unexposed pregnancy week for days of the wildfires. Generalized linear models were then used to assess the associations between birth weight and exposure to wildfires after adjusting for fetal sex, gestational age, parity, maternal age, maternal education, paternal education, and average exposed atmospheric temperature. RESULTS: Compared with unexposed pregnancies before and after the wildfires, mean birth weight decreased by 41.4 g (95% confidence interval [CI],-72.4 to-10.4) after wildfire exposure during the first trimester, 23.2 g (95% CI,-59.3 to 13.0) for expo-sure during the second trimester, and 27.0 g (95% CI,-63.8 to 9.8) during the third trimester. In the adjusted model for infants exposed in utero during any trimester, the mean birth weight decreased by 32.5 g (95% CI,-53.2 to-11.7). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a 1% reduction in birth weight after wildfire exposure. Thus, exposure to by-products gener-ated during a wildfire disaster during pregnancy may slow fetal growth and cause developmental delays.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the three-dimensional architecture of placental villi from normal and growth-restricted fetuses and relate findings to umbilical artery blood flow velocity waveforms.
   STUDY DESIGN: Placentas from term (n = 15) and preterm (n = 5) appropriately grown and term (n = 9) and preterm (n = 7) growth-restricted fetuses (birth weight <10th percentile) were examined to determine the number of arteries per stem villus and the three-dimensional configuration of the villous trees and their vessels. Umbilical blood flow before delivery was assessed by Doppler ultrasonography. The effects of age and growth restriction were determined by two-way analyses of variance.
   RESULTS: Growth restriction was associated with reduced large vessel wall thickness (p less than or equal to 0.05) but no reduction in the number of these vessels per stem villus. The volumes and surface areas of intermediate and terminal villi were reduced (p less than or equal to 0.001), especially in preterm growth-restricted cases, where a marked reduction in diastolic blood flow velocity was observed in the umbilical artery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Reduced villous development may contribute to abnormal umbilical artery blood flood flow, as assessed by Doppler ultrasonography, in some cases of intrauterine growth restriction.

AB  - Background Infant birthweight is an important public health indicator that is a proxy of maternal and baby's health. Earthquakes can cause acute distress, but can also contribute to chronic stress through long-term disruptions to social, economic and domestic circumstances. The aims of this study were to examine the direct effect of earthquake experiences on the birthweight of infants of women who experienced the 2015 Nepal Earthquakes during pregnancy and whether mental health mediated this relationship. Methods This is a prospective, population-based cohort study. Pregnant women in Bhaktapur District, Nepal who had experienced the 2015 earthquakes after conception were recruited. Baseline data were collected in structured individual interviews. Follow up was a short telephone interview two weeks after the baby's birth. Infant birthweight recorded on the hospital-issued birth certificate. The direct effect of earthquake experiences on birthweight and the indirect effect via antenatal common mental disorders (CMDs) were tested using Sobel tests simultaneously. Results In total 497/498 women contributed baseline data and 469 (94.4%) women also provided the birth weight of their infants. In total 6% of infants had low birth weight (< 2.5 kg). The earthquake experiences did not have a significant direct effect on birthweight (p = 0.116). However, the effect of earthquake experiences had a significant indirect effect on infant birthweight via CMDs. When 15 covariates were controlled, women who had moderate to severe earthquake experiences had an increase of 1.58 scores of antenatal CMD symptoms that resulted in their babies being 20.50 g lighter than those who had low earthquake experiences (p = 0.026). Conclusions The findings from this study indicate that the relationship is mediated by the mental health of women during pregnancy. Data demonstrate that the mental health of women who are pregnant should be prioritised in post-disaster management not only because of the burden experienced by women but also because of the risk for the growth and development of their babies.

AB  - We study the impacts of in utero exposure to Hurricane Catarina of March 2004, the first hurricane to hit Brazil. Catarina was unexpected and is representative of other recent hurricanes in the Americas in terms of wind speed, direct economic costs, and population affected. We use a triple differences strategy (close vs. far municipality, 2004 vs. 2003, after March vs. before) to highlight the importance of flexibly accounting for season of birth effects. We find that the adverse effects of exposure are concentrated among babies born to mothers 15-24 years old: birth weight decreased by 82 g, the probability of being born with low birth weight increased by 3.4 percentage points, and fetal deaths increased by about 17 per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths. Reductions in employment or healthcare use do not explain these impacts. Maternal stress is a plausible mechanism if younger women are more financially vulnerable to negative shocks, consistent with recent work highlighting the relationship between socioeconomic status, stress, and birth outcomes. Our findings are robust to various checks, including testing for pre-trends in infant health outcomes.

AB  - Wildfire-specific particulate matter with diameters <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) is the key component of wildfire smoke, with potentially higher toxicity than PM2.5 from other sources. In this nationwide population-based cohort study, we included 22,163,195 births from Brazil during 20102019. Daily wildfire-specific PM2.5 was estimated through the chemical transport model. Time-varying Cox proportional hazards models were used to characterize the exposure-time-response (E-T-R) relationship between weekly wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure and preterm birth (PTB) risks, followed by subgroup analyses. A 10 mu g/m(3) increment in wildfire-specific PM2.5 was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.047 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.032-1.063) for PTB. Stronger associations between wildfire-specific PM2.5 and PTB were observed during earlier pregnancy, among female infants, and pregnant women < 18 years old, in ethnic minorities, with a length of education >= 11 years, from low-income or high-temperature municipalities, and residing in North/Northeast regions. An estimated 1.47 % (95 % CI: 1.01 %1.94 %) of PTBs were attributable to wildfire-specific PM2.5 in Brazil, increasing from 2010 to 2019. The PTBs attributable to wildfire-specific PM2.5 surpassed those attributed to non-wildfire PM2.5 (0.31 %, 95(%) CI: 0.09 %0.57 %). Wildfire emerged as a critical source contributing to the PM2.5-linked PTBs. Prioritized fire management and emission control strategies are warranted for PTB prevention.

AB  - Stress due to earthquakes and other natural catastrophic events may result in a decline in the male to female ratio of newborn infants. One reason may be an increased death of male fetuses 3-5 months earlier. Another reason may relate to reduced conception of males and/or early male embryo demise 8-10 months earlier. Almost all of the earthquakes and natural catastrophic events have caused declines in sex ratios at birth except the Hurricane Katrina which showed a rise in the birth sex ratio. We describe hypothetical immunological cause for the decline in the sex ratio at birth following periods of augmented stress levels.

AB  - The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, along with natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, have led to decades of disaster preparedness planning. Despite the attention and focus on planning, many studies have found that hospitals are ill prepared to appropriately manage extended disasters. The author completed her doctoral program capstone project on neonatal intensive care unit disaster preparedness. This article discusses lessons learned during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and what future disaster preparedness plans must consider.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Natural and man-made disasters as well as declining economies appear to coincide with reduced odds of male live births among humans (i.e. lower secondary sex ratio). This association has been attributed to excess death of males in gestation and to reduced conception of males. We attempt to empirically discriminate between these two attributions by testing the hypotheses that the attacks of September 11, 2001 were followed in California first by higher fetal death sex ratios and later by lower sex ratios among very low weight births and total live births. METHODS: We apply interrupted time-series methods to the fetal death, very low birth weight, and secondary sex ratios. The methods control for trends, seasonal cycles, and other forms of autocorrelation that could induce spurious associations. RESULTS: Findings support the excess death explanation in that the fetal death sex ratio reached its highest level in the 6 year test period in October and November of 2001, while the very low weight birth sex ratio dropped to its lowest level in 14 years in December of 2001. The secondary sex ratio exhibited its second lowest value in 14 years in December of 2001. No support was found for the reduced conception explanation in that the sex ratio did not differ from expected values 9, 10 or 11 months after the attacks. CONCLUSIONS: We infer support for the excess death explanation at the expense of the reduced conception explanation. We also describe the implications of our findings for public health planning.

AB  - Background Exposure to PM2.5 from wildfire smoke during pregnancy has been implicated as a risk factor for preterm birth. We investigated this association in the prospective nationwide US Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Cohort, focusing on prenatal wildfire PM2.5 exposure intensity, duration, and timing. Methods In this cohort analysis, we included live singleton births recorded in the ECHO Cohort with available data on gestational age at birth and birthweight and dates of conception between Jan 1, 2006, and March 20, 2020. Census tract-level estimates of daily mean wildfire-derived PM2.5 for the years 2006-20 from a previous machine learning model were linked to residential address history. We calculated the mean concentration of daily wildfire PM2.5, days with wildfire PM2.5 (>0, >= 2.5, >= 5.0, and >= 10.0 mu g/m(3); termed smoke days) and consecutive smoke days (2, 3, or >= 4 days; termed smoke waves) above the prespecified concentration thresholds across pregnancy. Associations of cumlative pregnancy wildfire PM2.5 exposure with preterm birth (delivery before 37 weeks of gestation) were analysed by adjusted pooled logistic regression in the nationwide ECHO sample and in the US West census region. Associations between smoke days in gestational weeks 0-35 and preterm birth were evaluated by logistic regression in the national sample. Findings We included 20 034 births from 30 ECHO Cohort study sites, with residences during pregnancy in all 48 contiguous US states and the District of Columbia. 1687 (8.4%) of the 20 034 infants were preterm. The mean daily wildfire PM2.5 concentration during pregnancy was 0.36 mu g/m(3) (SD 0.46), with exposure to a mean of 22.2 smoke days (SD 16.6) of any wildfire PM2.5 concentration (>0 mu g/m(3)). Estimates of association between wildfire PM2.5 exposure metrics and preterm birth included the null in nationwide analyses; whereas, in the US West sample (N=5807), we estimated increased odds of preterm birth associated with mean daily wildfire PM2.5 (odds ratio [OR] 1.139 per 1-mu g/m3 increase [95% CI 1.001-1.296]), exposure to smoke days with a wildfire PM2.5 concentration of 5.0 mu g/m(3) or greater (OR 1.018 per additional smoke day [1.003-1.032]) and 10.0 mu g/m(3) or greater (OR 1.030 [1.006-1.054]), and exposure to >= 4-day smoke waves of 5.0 mu g/m(3) or greater (OR 1.185 per additional smoke wave [1.044-1.347]) and 10.0 mu g/m(3) or greater (OR 1.232 [1.029-1.475]). At the national level, by week of gestation, associations with preterm birth were observed in mid-pregnancy for smoke days with wildfire PM2.5 concentrations above 0 mu g/m3, of 2.5 mu g/m(3) or greater, and of 5.0 mu g/m(3) or greater, and in late pregnancy for smoke days of 10.0 mu g/m(3) or greater. Interpretation In a prospective cohort, we observed increased odds of preterm birth associated with wildfire PM2.5 exposure in the western USA, with findings suggesting an exposure-response relationship for increasing exposure intensity and duration. Preterm birth was also associated with exposure to smoke days in mid-to-late pregnancy at the national level. For practice and policy, these findings support the need for public health interventions aimed at reducing exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy.

AB  - The Japanese earthquake and tsunami drew attention worldwide to nuclear power plant accidents and associated health risks. Since Chernobyl 25 years ago, several studies were published and we now have precise information concerning the long-term health of the population living near nuclear power plants and also in different European countries. The authors hope to bring some answers to the key questions from the public concerning radioactive units used and their significance, the evaluation of the number of radio-induced cancers within the different countries of Europe, other eventual health effects and the problem of possible congenital anomalies. Finally, French public perception on nuclear risk is examined and the feedback of the Japanese experience is evoked. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current study examined the moderating role of social support in the association between prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) and childhood body mass index (BMI) in the context of the Iowa floods of 2008. In addition, the mediating role of offspring birthweight was examined in the association between PNMS and childhood BMI. We recruited women from eastern Iowa who were pregnant in 2008 when disastrous floods occurred. Self-report measures of PNMS and cognitive appraisal of the flood's consequences were obtained shortly after the disaster. Social support was assessed during pregnancy. Offspring anthropometric measures were collected at birth and 30 months. Moderated mediation results indicated that greater PNMS predicted greater BMI at age 30 months through effects on higher birthweight as a mediator, but only for participants with low social support. High social support (satisfaction or number) buffered the effect of PNMS or a negative appraisal of the flood on birthweight. The combination of high PNMS or a negative appraisal of the flood's consequences and low social support resulted in higher offspring birthweight, which predicted greater BMI at 30 months. Providing strong social support to pregnant women following a stressor might buffer the effects of PNMS on offspring birthweight and later obesity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: More intense cyclones are expected in the future as a result of climate change. A comprehensive review is urgently needed to summarize and update the evidence on the health effects of cyclones. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to provide a systematic review with meta-analysis of current evidence on the risks of all reported health outcomes related to cyclones and to identify research gaps and make recommendations for further research. METHODS: We systematically searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies in English published before 21 December 2022. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guide-lines, we developed inclusion criteria, screened the literature, and included epidemiological studies with a quantitative risk assessment of any mortality or morbidity-related outcomes associated with cyclone exposures. We extracted key data and assessed study quality for these studies and applied meta-analyses to quantify the overall effect estimate and the heterogeneity of comparable studies. RESULTS: In total, 71 studies from eight countries (the United States, China, India, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Australia, Brazil), mostly the United States, were included in the review. These studies investigated the all-cause and cause-specific mortality, as well as morbidity related to injury, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, mental disorders, adverse birth outcomes, cancer, diabetes, and other outcomes (e.g., suicide rates, gender-based violence). Studies mostly included only one high-amplitude cyclone (cyclones with a Saffir-Simpson category of 4 or 5, i.e., Hurricanes Katrina or Sandy) and focused on mental disorders morbidity and all-cause mortality and hospitalizations. Consistently elevated risks of overall mental health morbidity, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as all-cause mortality or hospitalizations, were found to be associated with cyclones. However, the results for other outcomes were generally mixed or limited. A statistically significant overall relative risk of 1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.13], 1.18 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.25), 1.15 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.18), 1.26 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.50) was observed for all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalizations, respiratory disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospitalizations, respectively, after cyclone exposures, whereas no statistically significant risks were identified for diabetes mortality, heart disease mortality, and preterm birth. High between-study heterogeneity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: There is generally consistent evidence supporting the notion that high-amplitude cyclones could significantly increase risks of mental disorders, especially for PTSD, as well as mortality and hospitalizations, but the evidence for other health outcomes, such as chronic diseases (e.g., CVDs, cancer, diabetes), and adverse birth outcomes remains limited or inconsistent. More studies with rigorous exposure assessment, of larger spatial and temporal scales, and using advanced modeling strategy are warranted in the future, especially for those small cyclone-prone countries or regions with low and middle incomes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12158

AB  - Objective We aimed to compare the pregnancy status of the pregnant women and birth status of their newborns, socioeconomic status, and access to health services, between high- and low-damage areas in Heris, affected by the Varzaghan Earthquake, 2012. Methods The study was conducted on pregnant women at any trimester of pregnancy (with complete medical profiles in local health centers) in August 2012 (time of the earthquake) who lived in Heris and delivered up to March 2013. Data were obtained on pregnancy- and infant-related variables, housing, socioeconomic status, and access to health services, including food supplies, before and after the earthquake. Results Family income and mothers' education were lower in highly damaged areas. Among these women, underweight at first trimester of pregnancy was higher, and weight gain during the last trimester was lower, compared with low-damage regions. Preterm delivery was higher in low-damage areas. Birth indices of the infants were not significantly different between the 2 areas; however, in highly damaged areas, moderate malnutrition was more prevalent among children under 1 year (weight-for-age) and under 2 years (height-for-age). Conclusions Socioeconomic status of mothers was lower in highly damaged areas and might have played a role in their own and newborns' health status.

AB  - Both acute and chronic stress can cause allostatic overload, or long-term imbalance in mediators of homeostasis, that results in disruptions in the maternal-placental-fetal endocrine and immune system responses. During pregnancy, disruptions in homeostasis may increase the likelihood of preterm birth and preeclampsia. Expectant mothers traditionally have high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders, and many are susceptible to a variety of stressors during pregnancy. These common life stressors include financial concerns and relationship challenges and may be exacerbated by the biological, social, and psychological changes occurring during pregnancy. In addition, external stressors such as major weather events (eg, hurricanes, tornados, floods) and other global phenomena (eg, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) may contribute to stress during pregnancy.
   This review investigates recent literature published about the use of nonpharmacologic modalities for stress relief in pregnancy and examines the interplay between psychiatric diagnoses and stressors, with the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of implementing nonpharmacologic interventions as sole therapies or in conjunction with psychotherapy or psychiatric medication therapy. Further, the effectiveness of each nonpharmacologic therapy in reducing symptoms of maternal stress is reviewed. Mindfulness meditation and biofeedback have shown effectiveness in improving one's mental health, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety. Exercise, including yoga, may improve both depressive symptoms and birth outcomes. Expressive writing has successfully been applied postpartum and in response to pregnancy challenges. Although some of these nonpharmacologic interventions can be convenient and low cost, there is a trend toward inconsistent implementation of these modalities. Future investigations should focus on methods to increase ease of uptake, ensure each option is available at home, and provide a standardized way to evaluate whether combinations of different interventions may provide added benefit.

AB  - The 2020 wildfire season was devastating to the Western United States and affected the region's NICUs. In this study, we ask the question, "what tools/strategies do medical professionals deem as important and most helpful as they are preparing for wildfire disaster response?" It is a follow up to our previous study: Learning from Wildfire Disaster Experience in California NICUs. We reevaluated how California NICUs dealt with the 2020 wildfires and expanded to Oregon and Southwest (SW) Washington NICUs. We conducted a survey with eleven Oregon and SW Washington NICUs about their wildfire evacuation preparedness. We also interviewed two neonatologists about their wildfire disaster experience evacuating their NICU or preparing to evacuate. Our findings suggest there is more work needed to fully prepare NICUs for wildfire disasters. We hope that by bringing light to the strategies used by affected clinicians, we can educate and support future NICU disaster preparedness responses.

AB  - Objective: To examine the relationship between maternal stress exposure, stress coping styles, and pregnancy complications.
   Design: Quantitative, cross-sectional, and prospective study.
   Setting: Tulane-Lakeside Hospital, New Orleans, LA and Women's Hospital, Baton Rouge, LA.
   Participants: The study included 146 women (122 from New Orleans and 24 from Baton Rouge), who were pregnant during or immediately after Hurricane Katrina.
   Methods: Participants were interviewed regarding their hurricane experiences and perceived stress, and coping styles were assessed using the Brief COPE. Medical charts were also reviewed to obtain information about pregnancy outcomes. Logistic regression was performed to determine possible associations.
   Results: Hurricane exposure was significantly associated with induction of labor (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.03, 1.86], P =.03) and current perceived stress (aOR = 1.50, CI [1.34, 1.99], P <.01). Stress perception significantly predisposed to pregnancy-induced hypertension (aOR = 1.16, CI [1.05, 1.30], P <.01) and gestational diabetes (aOR = 1.13, CI [1.02, 1.25], P =.03). Use of planning, acceptance, humor, instrumental support, and venting coping styles were associated with a significantly reduced occurrence of pregnancy complications (P <.05). Higher rates for gestational diabetes was found among women using the denial coping style (aOR = 2.25, CI [1.14, 4.45], P =.02).
   Conclusion: Exposure to disaster-related stress may complicate pregnancy, whereas some coping styles may mitigate its effects. Further research should explore how coping styles may mitigate or exacerbate the effect of major stressors and how positive coping styles can be encouraged or augmented.

AB  - Pregnant women and infants have unique health concerns in the aftermath of a natural disaster, epidemic, or terrorist event. Disruptions in the availability of clean water supply, inadequate access to safe food, exposure to environmental toxins, interruption of access to regular healthcare, shortages of life-sustaining medicines, and crowded conditions in shelters are just a few of the commonly encountered postdisaster challenges. Disasters may alter the environment and limit the availability of clean, secure areas for women to give birth safely. There are numerous potential complications for pregnant women in a disaster including preterm labor, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), infections, and diabetes (Callaghan et al., 2007; Sulaiman, Mohamad, Ismail, Johari, & Hussain, 2016). Additionally, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with premature deliveries, increased cesarean rates, and small for gestational age babies in several studies (Lipkind, Curry, Huynh, Thorpe, & Matte, 2010).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze various hazardous obstetrical problems and pregnancy outcome in flood affected pregnant women.
   STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive case series.
   PLACE: Flood affected camps at District Jamshoro, Dadu, and Hydeabad Sindh.
   METHODOLOGY: This study was conducted at flood relief camps at District Jamshoro, Dadu and Hyderabad from August 2010 to November 2010. During this study period all the pregnant women with various obstetrical problems were included while the pregnant women with other medical problems having no direct or indirect effect on pregnancy like gastroenteritis, skin problems were excluded from the study. These women were registered on pre-designed proforma. Data were collected and analyzed on SPSS version 16.
   RESULT: Total 571 (15.01%) women were having different obstetrical problems during the study period. Majority of these women 313 (54.81%) were in between 21-30 years of age group and were in last trimester of pregnancy 359 (62.87%). Commonest obstetrical problems seen in flood affected women were anaemia in 399 (69.87%) cases. Their hemoglobin percentage was below 9 gram, abruptio placentae in 79 (13.83%) cases, premature rupture of membranes in 69 (12.08%). Maternal morbidity seen was due to obstetrical trauma in 157 (27.49%) cases, post partum haemorrhage in 143 (25.04%) cases. Fetal problems seen were low birth weight in 237 (41.50%) cases, still birth in 67 (11.73%) cases.
   CONCLUSION: Pregnant women were severely affected by the flood having major impact on their health, life and their off spring.

AB  - There is limited population-scale evidence on the burden of exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy and its impacts on birth outcomes. In order to investigate this relationship, data on every singleton birth in California 2006-2012 were combined with satellite-based estimates of wildfire smoke plume boundaries and high-resolution gridded estimates of surface PM2.5 concentrations and a regression model was used to estimate associations with preterm birth risk. Results suggest that each additional day of exposure to any wildfire smoke during pregnancy was associated with an 0.49 % (95 % CI: 0.41-0.59 %) increase in risk of preterm birth ( 37 weeks). At sample median smoke exposure (7 days) this translated to a 3.4 % increase in risk, relative to an unexposed mother. Estimates by trimester suggest stronger associations with exposure later in pregnancy and estimates by smoke intensity indicate that observed associations were driven by higher intensity smoke-days. Exposure to low intensity smoke-days had no association with preterm birth while an additional medium (smoke PM2.5 5-10 mu g/m(3)) or high (smoke PM2.5 10 mu g/m(3)) intensity smoke-day was associated with an 0.95 % (95 % CI: 0.47-1.42 %) and 0.82 % (95 % CI: 0.41-1.24 %) increase in preterm risk, respectively. In contrast to previous findings for other pollution types, neither exposure to smoke nor the relative impact of smoke on preterm birth differed by race/ethnicity or income in our sample. However, impacts differed greatly by baseline smoke exposure, with mothers in regions with infrequent smoke exposure experiencing substantially larger impacts from an additional smoke-day than mothers in regions where smoke is more common. We estimate 6,974 (95 % CI: 5,513-8,437) excess preterm births attributable to wildfire smoke exposure 2007-2012, accounting for 3.7 % of observed preterm births during this period. Our findings have important implications for understanding the costs of growing wildfire smoke exposure, and for understanding the benefits of smoke mitigation measures.

AB  - Perinatal mortality in Germany was investigated with respect to a possible relationship to the nuclear accident in Chernobyl on April 26, 1986. Using annual data of perinatal mortality, a trend analysis based on an appropriately chosen statistical model was performed which showed a significant increase in 1987. In addition, we calculated the cesium concentration in women's bodies using data of the cesium concentration in milk. We found two peaks of cesium concentration that were associated with the observed two peaks of monthly perinatal mortality data with a delay of 7 months.

AB  - We examine the impact of a major earthquake that unexpectedly affected the Canterbury region of New Zealand on a wide-range of birth outcomes, including birth weight, gestational age, and an indicator of general newborn health. We control for observed and unobserved differences between pregnant women in the area affected by the earthquake and other pregnant women by including mother fixed effects in all of our regression models. We extend the previous literature by comparing the impact of the initial unexpected earthquake to the impacts of thousands of aftershocks that occurred in the same region over the 18 months following the initial earthquake. We find that exposure to these earthquakes reduced gestational age, increased the likelihood of having a late birth, and negatively affected newborn health-with the largest effects for earthquakes that occurred in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy. Our estimates are similar when we focus on just the impact of the initial earthquake or, in contrast, on all earthquakes controlling for endogenous location decisions using an instrumental variables approach. This suggests that the previous estimates in the literature that use this approach are likely unbiased and that treatment effects are homogenous in the population. We present supporting evidence that the likely channel for these adverse effects is maternal stress.

AB  - In February 1825, the dikes broke after a spring tide in the Krummho<spacing diaeresis>rn region in East Frisia, Germany, causing a severe disaster. Although the flood did not claim many victims, substantial damage was done to the farmland, and the economic crisis that followed permanently changed the social structure in the Krummho<spacing diaeresis>rn. We study family reconstitutions of the region linked to information about socioeconomic status, detailed reports of the flood damage, and information on crop prices for the entire study period. We innovate on the literature through our reconstruction of property damage at the parish level, as well as of the economic development in the region, combined with family reconstitutions. We investigate the short-term impact of the flood on marital fertility and child mortality, as well as the long-term impact on age at first childbirth and age at first marriage of individuals who experienced the flood early in life. We use Cox proportional hazard models to study mortality. The timing and the likelihood of transitions are investigated with the help of mixed parametric cure models. We find that child mortality, but not infant mortality, increased in the flood aftermath, but that this increase in mortality was not attributable to the flood-related damage. Furthermore, we find no evidence of changes in the timing of first childbirth or marriage among the affected individuals. These findings contrast with the results of several other studies indicating that external shocks and crisis experience early in life affect life course outcomes.

AB  - This study aimed to assess long-term changes in pregnancy and birth outcomes after the Great East Japan Earthquake and the accident at the Tokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Fukushima Prefecture. This is the final report on perinatal outcomes of the Prefectural Health Survey, which ended after a 10- year observation period. Questionnaires based on a pregnancy and birth survey conducted by the Radiation Medical Science Center for the Fukushima Health Management Survey were sent to women who had received maternal and child health handbooks from municipal officers in Fukushima Prefecture. Annual data from six geographic areas in Fukushima Prefecture were separately analyzed. The number of eligible respondents, which was approximately 16,000 in 2011 when the earthquake occurred, declined temporarily the following year, recovered temporarily one year later, and has gradually declined since then. However, the response rate remained at approximately 50% throughout the decade. The incidence of preterm deliveries, low-birthweight infants, and congenital anomalies did not vary over the decade and showed a similar trend in national surveys and general reports. Our analysis shows that the disaster had no significant adverse perinatal outcomes in Fukushima Prefecture and we recommend measures to ensure the safe delivery of babies in the region.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the impacts of maternal exposure to acute episodes of outdoor air pollution, such as that resulting from wildfires, on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. This systematic review aims to synthesise the existing literature exploring the relationship between maternal exposure to short-to medium-term changes in outdoor air quality and obstetric and neonatal outcomes.
   Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed articles using PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, ProQuest, GreenFILE and Scopus was conducted in January 2018 using selected search terms. Quality of included studies were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
   Results: Eleven studies were included; eight assessed the impact of maternal exposure to air pollution exacerbation events, such as wildfires, oil well fires and volcanic eruptions, and three assessed the impact of improvement events, such as the 2018 Beijing Olympics and closure of industrial activities, on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Studies were highly heterogenous in methodology. Six studies found a significant association between acute changes in air quality and markers of fetal growth restriction, while two did not. Three studies found an adverse association between acute changes in air quality and markers of gestational maturity, and one did not.
   Conclusion: Overall, there is some evidence that maternal exposure to acute changes in air quality of short-to medium-term duration increases the risk of fetal growth restriction and preterm birth. The relationship for other adverse obstetric or neonatal outcomes is less clear. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Climate change continues to increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat events and wildfires, both of which are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Few studies simultaneously evaluated exposures to these increasingly common exposures. Objectives: We investigated the relationship between exposure to heat and wildfire smoke and preterm birth (PTB). Methods: In this time-stratified case-crossover study, participants consisted of 85,806 California singleton PTBs (20-36 gestational weeks) from May through October of 2015-2019. Birthing parent ZIP codes were linked to high-resolution daily weather, PM2.5 from wildfire smoke, and ambient air pollution data. Heat day was defined as a day with apparent temperature >98th percentile within each ZIP code and heat wave was defined as >= 2 consecutive heat days. Wildfire-smoke day was defined as a day with any exposure to wildfire-smoke PM2.5. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing exposures during a hazard period (lags 0-6) compared to control periods. Analyses were adjusted for relative humidity, fine particles, and ozone. Results: Wildfire-smoke days were associated with 3.0% increased odds of PTB (ORlag0: 1.03, CI: 1.00-1.05). Compared with white participants, associations appeared stronger among Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indians/Alaskan Native participants. Heatwave days (ORlag2: 1.07, CI: 1.02-1.13) were positively associated with PTB, with stronger associations among those simultaneously exposed to wildfire smoke days (ORlag2: 1.19, CI: 1.11-1.27). Similar findings were observed for heat days and when other temperature metrics (e.g., maximum, minimum) were used. Discussion: Heat and wildfire increased PTB risk with evidence of synergism. As the occurrence and co-occurrence of these events increase, exposure reduction among pregnant people is critical, especially among racial/ethnic minorities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In late October 2003, a series of wildfires exposed urban populations in Southern California to elevated levels of air pollution over several weeks. Previous research suggests that short-term hospital admissions for respiratory outcomes increased specifically as a result of these fires.
   OBJECTIVE: We assessed the impact of a wildfire event during pregnancy on birth weight among term infants.
   METHODS: Using records for singleton term births delivered to mothers residing in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) during 2001-2005 (n = 886,034), we compared birth weights from pregnancies that took place entirely before or after the wildfire event (n = 747,590) with those where wildfires occurred during the first (n = 60,270), second (n = 39,435), or third (n = 38,739) trimester. The trimester-specific effects of wildfire exposure were estimated using a fixed-effects regression model with several maternal characteristics included as covariates.
   RESULTS: Compared with pregnancies before and after the wildfires, mean birth weight was estimated to be 7.0 g lower [95% confidence interval (CI): -11.8, -2.2] when the wildfire occurred during the third trimester, 9.7 g lower when it occurred during the second trimester (95% Cl: -14.5, -4.8), and 3.3 g lower when it occurred during the first trimester (95% Cl: -7.2, 0.6).
   CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy during the 2003 Southern California wildfires was associated with slightly reduced average birth weight among infants exposed in utero. The extent and increasing frequency of wildfire events may have implications for infant health and development.

AB  - On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall and inflicted devastation across the Gulf Coast. The catastrophic hurricane and flooding from failed levees in New Orleans made this event the most destructive natural and man-made disaster to occur in the United States history (White House, 2006). Such a massive disaster challenged survival for everyone in its path, including patients and healthcare professionals. This hurricane challenged the usual standards of care and disaster management strategies well beyond what we had ever prepared for or experienced. The city of New Orleans was under 8 to 12 feet of water. Memorial Medical Center, located in one of the lowest sections of the city, quickly became isolated from everyone and everything. The challenges that nurses faced during the 6 days after the disaster were arduous and multifaceted. Nurses had no choice but to be creative and flexible and improvise by using what limited resources were available. Nurses were not able to provide care in the typical patient care environment because patients were relocated to multiple areas of the hospital, the ER ramp, and the parking garage to await evacuation. The temperature soared to 110 degrees F, and evacuation efforts were chaotic and disorganized. This article describes the heroic efforts of a strong and cohesive nursing team in caring for our patients and providing for the evacuation of 16 critically ill newborns from the Level 3 regional neonatal intensive care unit and 5 well newborns and their mothers.

AB  - The coastal population of Indian subcontinent experience a variety of coastal hazards, of which cyclone is the most destructive one. The paper analyses the vulnerability level of the east coastal districts of Bay of Bengal stretching for 1400 km by adopting an innovative approach to estimate vulnerability index through hazard exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability measures. Findings reveal that northern districts located close to the apex of Bay of Bengal are more vulnerable to coastal cyclones as compared to the southern part. Districts with a higher degree of coastal vulnerability experience markedly higher neonatal and under-5 mortality. Prevalence of diarrhoea among children, unimproved sanitation facility and unimproved sources of drinking water are revealingly associated with more neonatal and under-5 mortality across coastal districts. Women, children, elderly and the agrarian population are more sensitive to the cyclone. Lack of infrastructure, education and poor health care system hinder adaptive capacity. The study propagates strong disaster planning and improvement of basic facilities, especially immunization coverages of the vulnerable districts of east coast in India.

AB  - The events of 9/11 released a million tons of toxic dust into lower Manhattan, an unparalleled environmental disaster. It is puzzling, then, that the literature has shown little effect of fetal exposure to the dust. However inference is complicated by preexisting differences between the affected mothers and other NYC mothers as well as heterogeneity in effects on boys and girls. Using all births in-utero on 9/11 in NYC and comparing them to their siblings, we show that residence in the affected area increased prematurity and low birth weight, especially for boys.

AB  - Introduction: Hurricanes Irma and Maria made landfall in the US Virgin Islands (USVI) in 2017. To date, there is no published literature available on the experiences of pregnant women in the USVI exposed to these hurricanes. Understanding how hurricanes affect pregnant women is key to developing and executing targeted hurricane preparedness and response policies. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of pregnancy and birth among women in the USVI exposed to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Methods: We employed a qualitative descriptive methodology to guide sampling, data collection, and analysis. Semi-structured interviews of 30-60 min in length were conducted with a purposive sample of women (N = 18) in the USVI who were pregnant during or became pregnant within two months after the hurricanes. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and data managed in MAXQDA. Team members developed a codebook, applied codes for content, and reconciled discrepancies. We thematically categorized text according to a socioecological conceptual framework of risk and resilience for maternal-neonatal health following hurricane exposure. Results: Women's experiences were organized into two main categories (risk and resilience). We identified the following themes related to risk at 3 socioecological levels including: (1) individual: changes in food access (We had to go without) and stress (I was supposed to be relaxing); (2) household/community: diminished psychosocial support (Everyone was dealing with their own things) and the presence of physical/environmental hazards (I was really scared); and (3) maternity system: compromised care capacity (The hospital was condemned). The themes related to resilience included: (1) individual: personal coping strategies (Being calm); (2) household/community: mutual psychosocial and tangible support (We shared our resources); and (3) the maternity system: continuity of high-quality care (On top of their game). Conclusions: A socioecological approach provides a useful framework to understand how risk and resilience influence the experience of maternal hurricane exposure. As the frequency of the most intense hurricanes is expected to increase, clinicians, governments, and health systems should work collaboratively to implement hurricane preparedness and response plans that address pregnant women's unique needs and promote optimal maternal-infant health.

AB  - We examine demographic patterns from a long-term study (1987-1996) of the population of ring-tailed lemurs in the Beza-Mahafaly Special Reserve, in southwestern Madagascar In particular we focus on the effects that a severe drought in 1991 and 1992 had on the population. The population of adult animals peaked in 1991 but decreased rapidly during the subsequent drought and immediate postdrought years. In the 1992 birth season (and second year of the drought) infant mortality reached 80%, and 20.8% of all adult females in the reserve died. The following year adult female mortality reached a high of 29.9%. Juvenile mortality in 3 intensively studied groups was 57% during the second year of the drought. We compare these data with infant, juvenile, and adult female mortality in non-drought years. We are not able to calculate adult male mortality, as they often emigrate from the reserve to the adjacent forest; however in the same 3 intensively studied groups, 89% of the males disappeared during the 2 immediate postdrought years. By 1996 the population had begun to recover after the decline that correlated with the drought conditions. Annual reproduction, high birth rates (.80-.86 annually), early sexual maturity and dietary adaptability may be contributing factors to the recovery. Effects of and recovery from this type of natural disaster in the Beza Mahafaly ring-tailed lemur population parallel responses of some species of macaques and baboons with respect to the adaptability of edge species.

AB  - Early forecasts give people in a storm's path time to prepare. Less is known about the cost to society when forecasts are incorrect. In this observational study, we examine over 700,000 births in the path of Hurricane Irene and find exposure was associated with impaired birth outcomes. Additional warning time was associated with decreased preterm birth rates for women who experienced intense storm exposures documenting a benefit of avoiding a type II forecasting error. A larger share of this at-risk population experienced a type I forecasting error where severe physical storm impacts were anticipated but not experienced. Disaster anticipation disrupted healthcare services by delaying and canceling prenatal care, which may contribute to storm-impacted birth outcomes. Recognizing storm damages depend on human responses to predicted storm paths is critical to supporting the next generation's developmental potential with judicious forecasts that ensure public warning systems mitigate rather than exacerbate climate damages.

TI  - The effect of a natural disaster on handgrip strength in prepubertal Indian children exposed to a severe cyclone during the prenatal and early postnatal growth
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - Natural disasters (NDs) experienced by women and their children during prenatal and infant growth may have long-lasting effects on offspring's development. Handgrip strength (HGS) is one of the measures of muscular strength and an indicator of health status. This study compared HGS in children exposed to cyclone Aila in India during their prenatal and infant growth compared to a control group from a non-affected, adjacent area. The total sample involved 444 boys and 423 girls aged 7-9 years, categorised into 3 groups: prenatally exposed to Aila, exposed to Aila in infancy, and the control group, non-exposed to Aila. Results revealed that prenatally exposed children of both sexes had significantly lower HGS than the controls (at least, p<0.001 in boys; p<0.05 in girls). On the other hand, the postnatally exposed boys, but not the girls, showed lower HGS than the controls. A significant effect of a group factor (ND exposure) on HGS was observed even after controlling for confounding variables (age, height, BMI, birth weight, gestational age; at least, p<0.05). Our findings indicate that prenatal or early postnatal experience of a ND may have association with impaired HGS in prepubertal children.

AB  - Aim: The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) was a disaster leading to radiation exposure and psychological distress, particularly among pregnant women. However, it is not known how this affected the seasonal changes of pregnancy and childbirth. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of the GEJE in the Fukushima Prefecture on spontaneous and induced abortions with regard to seasonal variability.Methods: We used the data of vital statistics of live birth and stillbirth registry and the census survey of the Fukushima Maternity Care Facility. We calculated the spontaneous and induced abortion rate for 2011-2016 using two different methods (cross-sectional and longitudinal). We calculated the quartiles and outliers to determine the impact and duration of the GEJE. Periodicity was investigated using spectral density analysis. The data were analyzed for the entire Fukushima Prefecture and by region.Results: The spontaneous abortion rate did not show specific changes after the GEJE. Contrarily, the monthly analysis in the cross-sectional method, revealed specific increases in induced abortion rate during the year after the GEJE; in the longitudinal method, induced abortions increased among women who became pregnant within 1 year after the GEJE. Spontaneous abortion showed no specific periodicity, while induced abortion showed cycles of 6 and 12 months, with a particular increase in May each year.Conclusions: The spontaneous abortion rate was not affected by the GEJE. The changes in the induced abortion rate after the disaster may have overlapped with the timing of the increased periodicity, and cannot be attributed solely to the GEJE.

AB  - We estimate the effects of wildfire smoke exposure on infant health. Exposure to wildfire smoke is determined using the latitude and longitude coordinates corresponding to each infant's home address and a fine-scaled spatial dataset of wildfire smoke plumes constructed in GIS from satellite images of the landscape. Using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, model estimates show that exposure to wildfire smoke leads to a .034 increase in the probability of low birthweight.

AB  - Background: The public health impacts of tropical cyclones (TCs) are expected to increase due to the continued growth of coastal populations and the increasing severity of these events. However, the impact of TCs on pregnant women, a vulnerable population, remains largely unknown. We aimed to estimate the association between prenatal exposure to TCs and risk of preterm birth in the eastern United States (US) and to assess whether the association varies by individual- and area-level characteristics. Methods: We included data on 19,529,748 spontaneous singleton births from 1989 to 2002 across 378 US counties. In each county, we classified days as exposed to a TC when TC-associated peak sustained winds at the county's population-weighted center were > 17.2 m/s (gale-force winds or greater). We defined preterm birth as births delivered prior to 37 completed weeks of gestation. We used distributed lag log-linear mixed-effects models to estimate the relative risk (RR) and absolute risk difference (ARD) for TC exposure by comparing preterm births occurring in TC-periods (from 2 days before to 30 days after the TC's closest approach to the county's population center) to matched non-TC periods. We conducted secondary analyses using other wind thresholds (12 m/s and 22 m/s) and other exposure metrics: county distance to storm track (30 km, 60 km, and 100 km) and cumulative rainfall within the county (75 mm, 100 mm, and 125 mm). Results: During the study period, there were 1,981,797 (10.1%) preterm births and 58 TCs that affected at least one US county on which we had birth data. The risk of preterm birth was positively associated with TC exposure defined as peak sustained wind speed > 17.2 m/s (gale-force winds or greater) [RR: 1.01 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.03); ARD: 9 (95% CI: -7, 25) per 10,000 pregnancies], distance to storm track < 60 km [RR: 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.04); ARD: 23 (95% CI: 9, 38) per 10,000 pregnancies], and cumulative rainfall > 100 mm [RR: 1.04 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.06); ARD: 36 (95% CI: 16, 56) per 10,000 pregnancies]. Results were comparable when considering other wind, distance, or rain thresholds. The association was more pronounced among early preterm births and mothers living in more socially vulnerable counties but did not vary across strata of other hypothesized risk factors. Conclusions: Maternal exposure to TC was associated with a higher risk of preterm birth. Our findings provide initial evidence that severe storms may trigger preterm birth.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: An adverse environment in utero, including exposure to prenatal maternal stress (PNMS), can result in poor birth outcomes such as low birth weight, which increases risk of later cardiometabolic diseases such as hypertension and obesity. It is unclear to what extent PNMS influences obesity risk independent of its impact on birth characteristics, especially among humans. Our objective was to determine whether PNMS resulting from a natural disaster influenced risk of childhood obesity.
   RESULTS: Eight children with high objective PNMS exposure (14.5%) were obese compared to one child (1.8%) with low exposure (P = 0.02). Objective PNMS increased obesity risk (model 1, P = 0.02, odds ratio = 1.37) after controlling for other potential risk factors.
   DISCUSSION: Results suggest that PNMS might be an independent risk factor in the development of childhood obesity.
   METHODS: Participants included 111 women who were pregnant during the January 1998 Quebec Ice Storm or who conceived within the following 3 months and their children. We tested associations between objective and subjective PNMS from the storm and childhood obesity status at age 51/2, controlling for children's birth characteristics and breastfeeding status; household socioeconomic status; maternal obstetric complications, life events and smoking during pregnancy, psychological functioning, and height (model 1, n = 111) or BMI (for a subset of 69 participants, model 2).

AB  - Background: Novel evidence suggests an association of wildfire smoke exposure with preterm birth (PTB). However, the mechanism and exposure timing of this association are poorly understood. Objective: We estimate the association of wildfire smoke on PTB phenotypes (spontaneous PTB [sPTB] and medically indicated PTB [mPTB]) as well as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). Study design: Birth cohort data from singleton livebirths in California from 2007 to 2012 were combined with daily zip code-level estimates of wildfire smoke intensity. Satellite-based estimates of wildfire smoke plume boundaries and high-resolution gridded estimates of surface particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) concentrations were used to calculate smoke exposure from 4 weeks preconception through gestational week 20. The two primary exposures were (1) wildfire smoke exposure at distinct gestational ages and (2) concentration of wildfire smoke exposure. Logistic regression models assessed associations between the number of wildfire smoke-exposed days and PTB phenotypes. HDP were also assessed as an outcome, given their major contribution to mPTB. Four primary outcomes were used: (1) overall PTB (<37 weeks), (2) sPTB, (3) mPTB, and (4) HDP. Results: Of 2,548,347 eligible pregnant individuals, 86% were exposed to at least 1 day of wildfire smoke of any PM2.5 intensity during the exposure period. Wildfire smoke of any intensity was significantly associated with sPTB during the exposure period (odds ratios [OR] [95% confidence intervals (CI)]: 1.003 [1.0021, 1.0039]). Each additional day of smoke exposure conferred 0.3% increased odds of sPTB. We did not observe an association of wildfire smoke with HDP. Only smoke exposure of any intensity between 14 and 20 weeks was associated with increased odds of mPTB OR CI (95%) (1.0038 [1.0008, 1.0069]). Wildfire smoke exposure of any intensity in the gestational period of smoke exposure was associated in increased odds of all PTB, except for the preconception period. Conclusions: Our study found an association of wildfire smoke exposure with PTB, which was largely driven by sPTB.

AB  - The PROTECT research Center funded by the NIH's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Superfund Research Program was launched in 2010 to explore the impact of exposure to pollutants on the high rate of premature births in Puerto Rico. In September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the archipelago, which caused: collapse of the electrical system, collapse of the communication system, limited access to clean water, food, gas, and health services, destruction of public (e.g., hospitals) and private property (e.g., houses) and more than 4500 deaths. Pregnant and postpartum individuals are especially vulnerable to natural disasters. They face difficulty obtaining adequate pre- and post-natal care, are exposed to increased risk of miscarriage, premature delivery, and giving birth to low birth weight babies during and after disasters and are also more likely to suffer physical and mental health problems compared to the general population during and after disasters. A face-to-face questionnaire was administered to PROTECT participants who were pregnant during hurricanes Irma or Maria or who became pregnant shortly after in order to identify hurricane-related sources of stress and other adverse effects. This paper is based on the answers to the open-ended question at the end of the questionnaire where participants were asked to share their experiences during and after the hurricanes. Among the 375 participants who completed the survey, 76 answers to the open-ended question were considered due to data saturation. The answers to the open-ended question were transcribed into a document in order to facilitate the coding process. The transcribed text was analyzed first to identify emerging categories and then coded to identify common themes as well as divergence among participants. The following themes were identified: pregnancy and birth challenges, lack of access to basic services, housing conditions, stressful working conditions, concerns about health, concerns about their children, and positive or protective aspects. The results indicate how the disruption in access to basic services has a unique impact on the physical and mental health of pregnant and post-partum women in an emergency situation. These findings point to the potential benefit of developing specific protocols designed for emergency preparedness aimed at this population, which can inform healthcare providers and community organizations in case of future events.

AB  - We examine the long-term impacts of drought exposure on women born in 19 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, across four decades. We find that women who were exposed to drought conditions during their early childhood are significantly less wealthy as adults. These effects are confined to women born and raised in rural households, indicating that the impacts of rainfall are felt via changes in agricultural output. In addition to lower levels of wealth, women who experience droughts in infancy also receive fewer years of formal education and, in the case of extreme drought conditions, have reduced adult heights. Our results also suggest that drought exposure in infancy can have long-term, negative impacts on women's empowerment. Finally, we also show that these impacts may be transmitted to the women's offspring, with children of affected women more likely to be born at a low birth weight (weighing <2.5 kg). To our knowledge, this represents the largest study to date both geographically and over time showing a strong relationship between early life rainfall conditions and adult outcomes, and the first to show that the impacts could span generations.

AB  - Large-scale catastrophic events and infectious disease outbreaks highlight the need for disaster planning at all community levels. Features unique to the obstetric population (including antepartum, intrapartum, postpartum and neonatal care) warrant special consideration in the event of a disaster. Pregnancy increases the risks of untoward outcomes from various infectious diseases. Trauma during pregnancy presents anatomic and physiologic considerations that often can require increased use of resources such as higher rates of cesarean delivery. Recent evidence suggests that floods and human-influenced environmental disasters increase the risks of spontaneous miscarriages, preterm births, and low-birth-weight infants among pregnant women. The potential surge in maternal and neonatal patient volume due to mass-casualty events, transfer of high-acuity patients, or redirection of patients because of geographic barriers presents unique challenges for obstetric care facilities. These circumstances require that facilities plan for additional increases in necessary resources and staffing. Although emergencies may be unexpected, hospitals and obstetric delivery units can prepare to implement plans that will best serve maternal and pediatric care needs when disasters occur. Clear designation of levels of maternal and neonatal care facilities, along with establishment of a regional network incorporating hospitals that provide maternity services and those that do not, will enable rapid transport of obstetric patients to the appropriate facilities, ensuring the right care at the right time. Using common terminology for triage and transfer and advanced knowledge of regionalization and levels of care will facilitate disaster preparedness.

AB  - There is evidence of a relationship between in utero exposure to catastrophic events and adverse birth outcomes, usually attributed to heightened maternal stress. The objective of our work was to evaluate if the breakage of a dam containing wastefrom a mining cite in Brazil, in 2015, an environmental disaster popularly known as the Mariana Tragedy, affected the health of newborns exposed in utero. We used administrative data on birth records and reports on the Mariana Tragedy to identify all births from newborns exposed in utero and the intensity of that exposure, according to the mother's municipality of residence. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we estimated the impact of different intensities of exposure on birth outcomes. We found that being directly exposed in utero to the Tragedy resulted in 1.86 days shorter gestational age and 2.6 percentage points higher incidence of preterm birth ( < 37 weeks). We found no impact on birth-weight related outcomes. The effect is larger than previously identified for other catastrophic events. We hypothesize that this is probably due to the Tragedy impacting birth outcomes not exclusively through heightened maternal stress, but also through depressed economic activity in directly affected municipalities.

AB  - During the past 20 years, there has been a flood of papers in the medical literature examining the impact of perinatal loss and documenting dramatic changes in the medical management of this loss. Although Bourne and Lewis (1992) have provided an annotated bibliography of nearly 400 papers concerning stillbirth and neonatal death alone, barely a trickle has come from psychoanalytic quarters. Unspoken allegiance to some traditional psychoanalytic beliefs that are increasingly viewed as outdated may impede applying contemporary psychoanalytic frameworks to understand perinatal loss. Four tenets of psychoanalytic theory-the unborn child experienced as solely a fantasy, mother's symbolic equation of her child primarily with the penis, unconscious causation of perinatal loss, and the ubiquity of unconscious ambivalence underlying parental guilt-are all critically evaluated and revised to introduce a contemporary psychoanalytic understanding of perinatal loss. Because a multidimensional psychoanalytic model has been described in detail elsewhere (Leon, 1990, 1992b), it is not elaborated here.

AB  - Background: Human infections with Serratia spp. are generally Limited to Serratia marcescens and the Serratia liquefaciens complex. There is Little data regarding the infections caused by the remaining Serratia spp., as they are seldom isolated from clinical specimens.
   Methods: In this health care setting in Kathmandu, Nepal routine blood culture is performed on all febrile patients with a temperature >38 degrees C or when there is clinical suspicion of bacteremia. During 2015 we atypically isolated and identified several Serratia spp. We extracted clinical data from these cases and performed whole genome sequencing on all isolates using a MiSeq system (Ilumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
   Results: Between June and November 2015, we identified eight patients with suspected bacteremia that produced a positive blood culture for Serratia spp., six Serratia rubidaea and five Serratia marcescens. The S. rubidaea were isolated from three neonates and were concentrated in the neonatal intensive care unit between June and July 2015. ALL patients were severely ill and one patient died. Whole genome sequencing confirmed that six Nepalese S. rubidaea sequences were identical and indicative of a single-source outbreak.
   Conclusions: Despite extensive screening we were unable to identify the source of the outbreak, but the inferred timeline suggested that these atypical infections were associated with the aftermath of two massive earthquakes. We speculate that deficits in hygienic behavior, combined with a Lack of standard infection control, in the post-earthquake emergency situation contributed to these unusual Serratia spp. outbreaks.

AB  - We investigated associations between preconception and prenatal heat stress and wildfire (WF) smoke exposures on adverse birth outcomes and whether neighborhood climate vulnerability is an effect modifier in the Maternal And Developmental Risks from Environmental and Social stressors cohort (N = 713). Generalized linear models were fit to test the association between exposures and small-for-gestational-age (SGA), low birthweight (LBW), and Fenton growth z-score outcomes, adjusting for confounders. Living in a high climate vulnerability index neighborhood was tested as an effect modifier. During preconception, increases in heat stress and WF measures were associated with higher odds of SGA. Living in the most climate-vulnerable neighborhoods during preconception significantly modified and nearly doubled the odds of SGA with exposure to heat stress. Similarly, heat stress and WF exposure in trimester-specific time periods were associated with adverse birth outcomes. Conversely, third-trimester exposures were associated with lower odds of LBW. Throughout pregnancy, two measures of infant size (SGA and Fenton z-scores) were lower among those with greater exposure to multiple WF exposures. This study highlights how living in more climate-vulnerable neighborhoods significantly modifies the effect of heat stress on SGA, suggesting that the increasing adaptation capacity of communities may strengthen climate change resilience.

AB  - Background Climate change and extreme weather events significantly threaten neonatal and child health. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence on the impact of climate change on child health, using the evidence gap map (EGM) to address knowledge gaps and establish a foundation for evidence-based interventions and future research.Method From inception, academic databases (such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, CINAHL and Scopus) and grey literature were systematically searched. We included climate change-related studies involving children aged 0-5 worldwide. Covidence facilitated a rigorous screening process, and we conducted a critical appraisal. Two independent reviewers handled screening and data extraction. Eligible studies underwent coding and extraction using Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (EPPI) reviewer software. The EGM was constructed using EPPI Mapper, and comprehensive findings were presented through live links and figures.Result We identified 196 studies, comprising 59.2% children and 40.8% neonates, with diverse research approaches, including 94% quantitative studies. There has been a notable increase in research publications over the past 5 years. Evidence is heavily concentrated in Asia (93 studies) and Africa (47 studies). The most frequently studied exposures are those related to extreme climate events, followed by drought and floods. However, there are gaps in the study of extreme cold and storms. The significant outcomes comprised preterm birth (55 studies), low birth weight (27 studies), malnutrition (59 studies) and diarrhoeal diseases (28 studies). Evidence on mental health problems and congenital disabilities receives relatively less attention.Conclusion This EGM is crucial for researchers, policymakers and practitioners. It highlights knowledge gaps and guides future research to address the evolving threats of climate change to global child health.Trial registration number INPLASY202370086

AB  - This study focuses on Guizhou Province, a region with difficult geographical conditions and poor economic development, to examine the effect of rainfall shocks on contemporaneous infant health and long-run socioeconomic outcomes in China. The study results indicate that negative rainfall shocks are robustly correlated with higher infant mortality and lower birth weight. In the long run, early life rainfall shortages limit an individual's income and housing conditions. The study findings indicate a significant interaction of rainfall shock with the severity of water scarcity. This result implies that drinking water safety is an essential channel through which early life rainfall shocks influence individual health endowments. However, agriculture production is not a likely channel for rainfall effects despite its association with infant mortality. Accordingly, our empirical results suggest that improving public facility coverage will reduce the vulnerability of infant health to adverse rainfall shocks in Guizhou and other developing areas.

AB  - Despite the occurrence of wildfires quadrupling over the past four decades, the health effects associated with wildfire smoke exposures during pregnancy remains unknown. Particulate matter less than 2.5 mu ms (PM2.5) is among the major pollutants emitted in wildfire smoke. Previous studies found PM2.5 associated with lower birthweight, however, the relationship between wildfire-specific PM2.5 and birthweight is uncertain. Our study of 7923 singleton births in San Francisco between January 1, 2017 and March 12, 2020 examines associations between wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy and birthweight. We linked daily estimates of wildfire-specific PM2.5 to maternal residence at the ZIP code level. We used linear and log-binomial regression to examine the relationship between wildfire smoke exposure by trimester and birthweight and adjusted for gestational age, maternal age, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment. We stratified by infant sex to examine potential effect modification. Exposure to wildfire-specific PM2.5 during the second trimester of pregnancy was positively associated with increased risk of large for gestational age (OR = 1.13; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.24), as was the number of days of wildfire-specific PM2.5 above 5 mu g m(-3) in the second trimester (OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.06). We found consistent results with wildfire smoke exposure in the second trimester and increased continuous birthweight-for-gestational age z-score. Differences by infant sex were not consistent. Counter to our hypothesis, results suggest that wildfire smoke exposures are associated with increased risk for higher birthweight. We observed strongest associations during the second trimester. These investigations should be expanded to other populations exposed to wildfire smoke and aim to identify vulnerable communities. Additional research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms in this relationship between wildfire smoke exposure and adverse birth outcomes.

AB  - There has long been anecdotal evidence of early labor and delivery in severe weather events leading to preterm birth. In particular, significant barometric pressure changes are associated with hurricanes and bomb cyclones. Some authors have related these low pressure weather events to premature rupture of fetal membranes, hypothesizing that the membranes act as an inflated balloon and respond directly to pressure changes. In this article, the key literature including data supporting this hypothesis is reviewed. A simple numerical model, based on a competition between the driving and resisting forces for fetal membrane rupture, is presented. This model provides a quantitative mechanism for membrane failure in the context of storms with low atmospheric pressure. Other sequelae of severe storms that are unrelated to fetal membrane rupture are also discussed. Labor and delivery in the context of major weather events should be understood in a holistic framework that includes both exogenous and endogenous factors relevant to the pregnant patient.

AB  - Pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction (FGR) continue to cause unacceptably high levels of morbidity and mortality, despite significant pharmaceutical and technological advances in other disease areas. The recent pandemic has also impacted obstetric care, as COVID-19 infection increases the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes. This review explores the reasons why it lacks effective drug treatments for the placental dysfunction that underlies many common obstetric conditions and describes how nanomedicines and targeted drug delivery approaches may provide the solution to the current drug drought. The ever-increasing range of biocompatible nanoparticle formulations available is now making it possible to selectively deliver drugs to uterine and placental tissues and dramatically limit fetal drug transfer. Formulations that are refractory to placental uptake offer the possibility of retaining drugs within the maternal circulation, allowing pregnant individuals to take medicines previously considered too harmful to the developing baby. Liposomes, ionizable lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, and adenoviral vectors have all been used to create efficacious drug delivery systems for use in pregnancy, although each approach offers distinct advantages and limitations. It is imperative that recent advances continue to be built upon and that there is an overdue investment of intellectual and financial capital in this field.

AB  - Purpose
   The quality and availability of sexual and reproductive health care are key determinants to reducing maternal mortalities and morbidities in disaster settings; yet, these services are often lacking in developing countries. Reducing maternal mortality and morbidity is currently the main targets of the UN's Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3. The purpose of this study was to develop an intervention package called RHCC (Reproductive Health Kit 8; Capacity building; Community awareness), and to implement and evaluate it in three primary health-care (PHC) facilities in Belkuchi, Bangladesh, in order to improve the quality and availability of post-abortion care (PAC) during the 2017 floods.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This research used both quantitative and qualitative methods to develop, implement and assess the RHCC in three flood-prone PHC facilities in Belkuchi.
   Findings
   The RHCC was implemented during the floods of 2017. The findings pre- and post-intervention suggest it led to an increase in skilled management among health workers, an increase in the quality of care for clients and the availability of PAC at three PHC facilities during floods.
   Originality/value
   Due to its geographic location, Bangladesh is exposed to recurrent floods and cyclones. Evidence-based integrated intervention packages, such as the RHCC, can improve the quality and availability of reproductive health care during disasters at PHC level and, in doing so, can promote the UN's agenda on "disaster resilient health system" to achieve the SDG 3, and the WHO's campaign on universal health coverage.

AB  - Background Birth defects are a major cause of poor health outcomes during both childhood and adulthood. A growing body of evidence demonstrated associations between air pollution exposure during pregnancy and birth defects. To date, there is no study looking at birth defects and exposure to wildfire-related air pollution, which is suggested as a type of air pollution source with high toxicity for reproductive health. Objective Our study addresses this gap by examining the association between birth defects and wildfire smoke exposure in Brazil between 2001 and 2018. Based on known differences of impacts of wildfires across different regions of Brazil, we hypothesized differences in risks of birth defects for different regions. Methods We used a logistic regression model to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for individual birth defects (12 categories) associated with wildfire exposure during each trimester of pregnancy. Results Among the 16,825,497 birth records in our study population, there were a total of 7595 infants born in Brazil between 2001 and 2018 with birth defects in any of the selected categories. After adjusting for several confounders in the primary analysis, we found statistically significant OR for three birth defects, including cleft lip/cleft palate [OR: 1.007 (95% CI: 1.001; 1.013)] during the second trimester of exposure, congenital anomalies of the respiratory system [OR: 1.013 (95% CI: 1.002; 1.023)] in the second trimester of exposure, and congenital anomalies of the nervous system [OR: 1.002 (95% CI: 1.001; 1.003)] during the first trimester of exposure for the regions South, North, and Midwest, respectively. Significance Our results suggest that maternal exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of an infant being born with some congenital anomaly. Considering that birth defects are associated with long-term disability, impacting families and the healthcare system (e.g., healthcare costs), our findings should be of great concern to the public health community. Impact statement Our study focused on the association between maternal exposure to wildfire smoke in Brazil during pregnancy and the risk of an infant being born with congenital anomalies, which presents serious public health and environmental challenges.

AB  - Legacies of racial capitalism and colonialism drive present day racial disparities in perinatal health outcomes. Climate change amplifies existing social inequalities associated with environmental exposures and reproductive health, of which BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) communities bear a disproportionate burden. Through case studies, this article summarizes three examples of climate justice issues with reproductive healthcare outcomes: traffic related air pollution exposure, chemical exposures in personal care products and plastics, and natural disaster frequency. We advocate for incorporation of climate justice and environmental health impact into medical school curriculum, increased prenatal screening for environmental toxins, and physician engagement with local environmental issues.

AB  - Climate change is accelerating the intensity and frequency of wildfires globally. Understanding how wildfire smoke (WS) may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and alterations in placental function via biological mechanisms is critical to mitigate the harms of exposure. We aim to review the literature surrounding WS, placental biology, biological mechanisms underlying adverse pregnancy outcomes as well as interventions and strategies to avoid WS exposure in pregnancy. This review includes epidemiologic and experimental laboratory-based studies of WS, air pollution, particulate matter (PM), and other chemicals related to combustion in relation to obstetric outcomes and placental biology. We summarized the available clinical, animal, and placental studies with WS and other combustion products such as tobacco, diesel, and wood smoke. Additionally, we reviewed current recommendations for prevention of WS exposure. We found that there is limited data specific to WS; however, studies on air pollution and other combustion sources suggest a link to inflammation, oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, DNA damage, telomere shortening, epigenetic changes, as well as metabolic, vascular, and endothelial dysregulation in the maternal-fetal unit. These alterations in placental biology contribute to adverse obstetric outcomes that disproportionally affect the most vulnerable. Limiting time outdoors, wearing N95 respirator face masks and using high quality indoor air filters during wildfire events reduces exposure to related environmental exposures and may mitigate morbidities attributable to WS.

AB  - This paper conducts an analysis of the socioeconomic determinants of Vietnam's cross-provincial variations in natural disaster vulnerability. The purpose is twofold: (i) to capture disaggregated vulnerability variations normally obscured by national statistics, thereby providing more nuanced insights into Vietnam's vulnerability to natural disasters; and (ii) to take advantage of the fact that the overall political system and key institutional structures to a large extent are constant across Vietnam's provinces, which makes the analysis a novel addition to the many disaster studies based on cross-national variations. The paper's analysis indicates that much of Vietnam's cross-provincial variations in natural disaster fatalities and economic costs can be explained by differences in key socioeconomic factors. High provincial rates of inequality, poverty and infant mortality, for instance, appear to drive up natural disaster fatalities. Local adaptation efforts should focus as much on these broader socioeconomic dimensions as they focus on the geophysical susceptibility to natural hazards of individual areas.

AB  - The process whereby a stimulus or stress at a critical or sensitive period of development has long-term effects is termed "programming." Studies in humans and animals convincingly demonstrate that environmental perturbations in utero may permanently change organ structure and metabolism and/or alter homeostatic regulatory mechanisms among the offspring. These programmed changes may be the origins of adult diseases, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. Throughout evolution and development, humans and animals have been exposed to two common environmental stresses, drought and famine. Notably, drought-induced water deprivation is associated with dehydration anorexia and thus a concomitant potential nutrient stress. Our laboratory has performed studies among pregnant rat and sheep in which we simulate drought conditions via maternal dehydration and famine conditions via nutrient restriction. Maternal dehydration results in low-birth-weight offspring, which demonstrate gender-specific plasma hypernatremia and hypertonicity and arterial hypertension. Gestational nutrient restriction also resulted in low-birth-weight offspring. If permitted rapid catch-up growth by nutrient availability, these offspring demonstrate evidence of increased body weight and body fat, and leptin resistance as adults. Conversely, if the catch-up growth is delayed by nutrition restriction, the offspring exhibit normal body weight, body fat, and plasma leptin levels as adults. These studies indicate that osmoregulatory and cardiovascular homeostasis and phenotypic predisposition to obesity may be programmed in utero. Importantly, these results suggest that programming effects may be either potentiated or prevented by interventions during the neonatal period.

AB  - ImportanceIn the current era of climate change, extreme heat exposure poses escalating threats to maternal-fetal health. Despite the expansive scale of extreme heat exposure worldwide, dramatized by the record-breaking global ocean and atmospheric temperatures throughout 2023 and into 2024, the extent of the threat posed by heat is underestimated and underappreciated. Unlike the physical destruction wrought by climate-driven events like hurricanes and wildfires, heat exposure does not cause severe damage to the built environment. Yet, in most years, heat has been the deadliest hazard in the United States.ObjectiveThis expert review aims to illuminate how climate-related heat affects maternal-fetal health and exacerbates health inequities. It will also discuss current knowledge gaps and underscore the crucial role that obstetric providers play in safeguarding pregnant persons from exposure to hazardous heat and increasing patient awareness of climate-related heat.Evidence AcquisitionEvidence for this review was primarily acquired through a comprehensive search of PubMed-indexed articles using MeSH terms and text words to search for concepts related to "climate change," "heat," "obstetrics," "pregnancy," "heat stress disorders," and their synonyms.ResultsExtreme heat exposure threatens the health and well-being of pregnant persons and elevates the likelihood of poor birth outcomes like preterm birth, fetal demise, and stillbirth, among other pregnancy complications. Extreme heat exposure also increases the risk of dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and gestational hypertension for pregnant persons.Conclusions and RelevanceUltimately, obstetric professionals are essential to improving the care of pregnant persons at increased risk from salient climate-related heat exposure.Target AudienceObstetricians and gynecologists, family physiciansLearning ObjectivesAfter completing this activity, the learner will be better able to explain the adverse health and pregnancy outcomes associated with climate-related heat or extreme heat exposure; describe current gaps in the literature and what research and guidelines are needed to better the field's understanding of how climate-related heat affects obstetric patients; and identify strategies for communities, providers, and patients to minimize the health harms of climate-related heat or extreme heat exposure.

AB  - Background: Previous research suggests that prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) impacts birth outcomes, but many human studies cannot distinguish between the effects of different types of stressors or examine effects of exposure timing on outcomes.
   Objectives: Our goal was to determine how timing and severity of exposure during pregnancy to objective and subjective stress due to a natural disaster influenced gestation length and fetal growth patterns.
   Methods: We assessed objective and subjective PNMS levels among 172 women exposed to an ice storm during or shortly before pregnancy. We analyzed associations between PNMS levels and outcomes (gestation length, birth weight, birth length, head circumference, and growth ratios), controlling for other variables such as age, obstetric complications, socioeconomic status, and trait anxiety.
   Results: Gestation lengths and predicted birth weights were shorter among participants exposed to the ice storm during early to mid pregnancy, compared to 3 rd trimester and pre-pregnancy exposure. Birth lengths were shorter in the sample compared to population references, and predicted values were shorter among participants with a "discrepancy" between their objective and subjective PNMS levels. High objective PNMS levels predicted smaller head circumferences in early pregnancy, but we also observed patterns in predicted values of head circumference to birth length ratios suggesting the sparing of brain development relative to birth length among boys in early pregnancy. These sparing effects decreased in later pregnancy.
   Conclusions: Exposure to stressful events during pregnancy influences birth outcomes independently of other factors. Exposure timing, newborn sex, and the type of stressor influence the effects observed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Exposure to floods might increase the risks of adverse birth outcomes. However, the current evidence is scarce, inconsistent, and has knowledge gaps. This study aims to estimate the associations of flood exposure before and during pregnancy with adverse birth outcomes and to identify susceptible exposure windows and effect modifiers. Methods In this cohort study, we obtained all the birth records occurring in Greater Sydney, Australia, from Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2020, from the New South Wales Midwives Data Collection and in the Brisbane metropolitan region, Australia, from Jan 1, 1995, to Dec 31, 2014, from the Queensland Health Perinatal Data Collection. For each birth, residential address and historical flood information from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory were used to estimate the numbers of days with floods during five exposure windows (Pre-1 was defined as 13-24 weeks before the last menstrual period [LMP], Pre-2 was 0-12 weeks before the LMP, trimester 1 [Tri-1] was 0-12 weeks after the LMP, trimester 2 [Tri-2] was 13-28 weeks after the LMP, and trimester 3 [Tri-3] was >= 29 weeks after the LMP). We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) of adverse birth outcomes (preterm births, stillbirths, term low birthweight [TLBW], and small for gestational age [SGA]) associated with flood exposures in the five exposure windows using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Findings 1 338 314 birth records were included in our analyses, which included 91 851 (6<middle dot>9%) preterm births, 9831 (0<middle dot>7%) stillbirths, 25 567 (1<middle dot>9%) TLBW, and 108 658 (8<middle dot>1%) SGA. Flood exposure in Pre-1 was associated with increased risks of TLBW (HR 1<middle dot>06 [95% CI 1<middle dot>01-1<middle dot>12]) and SGA (1<middle dot>04 [1<middle dot>01-1<middle dot>06]); flood exposure during Tri-1 was associated with increased risks of preterm births (1<middle dot>03 [1<middle dot>002-1<middle dot>05]), stillbirth (1<middle dot>11 [1<middle dot>03-1<middle dot>20]), and SGA (1<middle dot>03 [1<middle dot>01-1<middle dot>06]). In contrast, flood exposures during Pre-2 and Tri-3 were associated with reduced risks. Interpretation Exposures to floods in Pre-1 and Tri-1 are both associated with increased risks of adverse birth outcomes, and the risks increase with a higher exposure. Upon planning for conception and prenatal care, individuals and health practitioners should raise awareness of the increased risks of adverse birth outcomes after experiencing floods.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the many factors regarding socioeconomic and healthcare-related variables linked to maternal diseases and the possible impact of the environmental disaster of Mariana, given the prenatal exposure to different water sources for human consumption that were associated with low birthweight in full-term live births in the Municipal Hospital of Governador Valadares, Minas Gerais.
   METHODS: Case-control study, carried out with live births at the Municipal Hospital of Governador Valadares, from May 2017 to July 2018. The case group consisted of full-term live births and low birthweight, and the control group consisted of full-term live births with adequate weight, matched by gender and date of birth. For each case, two controls were selected. Data collection was performed through interviews with the puerperal women, and complementary information was obtained by analyzing the prenatal card and medical records. For data analysis, logistic regression was performed.
   RESULTS: The study included 65 live births from the case group and 130 from the control group. After the analysis was adjusted for other factors under study, we found that the higher risks of low birthweight are associated with the first childbirth (OR = 2.033; 95%CI = 1.047-3.948; p = 0.036), smoking during pregnancy (OR = 2.850; 95%CI = 1.013-8.021; p = 0.047) and consumption of water supplied by the municipalities affected by the tailings from the Fundao dam failure (RC = 2.444; 95%CI = 1.203-4.965; p = 0.013).
   CONCLUSIONS: The variables "water consumed during pregnancy," "previous pregnancies" and "maternal smoking" were associated with low birthweight in the population studied. The importance of epidemiological studies that assess water quality and its adverse health effects is reinforced, as well as greater prenatal control of first-time pregnant women and greater support of policies against smoking, especially during pregnancy.

AB  - The flood exposure in India exacerbates childhood malnutrition, particularly in the vulnerable regions of India. Presently, India is facing a dual burden of natural disasters and malnutrition, especially in the vulnerable regions that are exposed to floods. Many studies have been focused on micro-level or regional-level analyses. The present study is uniquely examining the association between flood exposure and malnutrition at a national scale. The study investigated the impacts of flood exposure on childhood malnutrition, using the Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure (CIAF) to assess stunting, wasting, and underweight among children under five years age group. The present study is based on the analyses of data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5, 2019-2021) and Central Water Commission (CWC) reports. The data were analyzed across flood-affected regions in India and categorized by the frequency of flood events (i.e., non-flooded; 1-2 times flooded; and three times flooded events). The analysis reveals a significant increase in malnutrition rates with higher flood exposure in regions experiencing three flood events, 38 percent of children were stunted, 20 percent were wasted, and 35.7 percent were underweight as compared to non-flooded areas. Factors such as low birth weight, maternal education, sanitation facilities, and household infrastructure intensified malnutrition outcomes. The major findings of the study suggested that repeated flooding events aggravate food insecurity and increase vulnerability to child malnutrition. This study not only highlights the compounded effects of flood exposure and socio-economic disparities on CIAF malnutrition but also offers policy-relevant insights. The results of the study highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions, including developing disaster-resilient infrastructure, educational programs for mothers, and enhanced access to sanitation and healthcare in flood-affected regions in India.

AB  - Background On 22 February 2011 an earthquake (magnitude 6.3) hit Christchurch, New Zealand. Earthquakes have been associated with increased risks of preterm birth (PTB) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, the literature on this subject is scarce. Maternal antenatal stress has been suggested as the link between earthquakes and PTB. In this study the Christchurch earthquake was utilised as a model of maternal stress to assess its effects on PTB rates and other pregnancy outcomes. Aim To investigate whether women who experienced a major earthquake during the first trimester of pregnancy were at an altered risk of PTB compared to women who did not experience an earthquake during their pregnancy. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study. Women carrying a singleton pregnancy in their first trimester on 22 February, 2011 were identified for a post-earthquake cohort (n = 1057). A group of women pregnant in 2009 were identified for a pre-earthquake cohort (n = 1314). Data were obtained from electronic medical records and the hospital clinical coding database. Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to analyse differences in pregnancy outcomes. Statistically significant variables together with earthquake exposure were assessed as risk factors for PTB using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results No significant difference in the rate of PTB was found between the two groups P > 0.05). Conclusion Women carrying a singleton pregnancy in this study who experienced a major earthquake in their first trimester do not seem to be at an increased risk of PTB.

AB  - This study examined the effects of three disasters (the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011, followed by a tsunami and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident) on feeding methods and growth in infants born after the disasters. Using results from the Fukushima Health Management Survey, Soso District (the affected area where the damaged nuclear power plant is located) and Aizu District (a less-affected area located farthest from the plant) were compared. In this study, newborn and maternal background characteristics were examined, as well as feeding methods, and other factors for newborn growth at the first postpartum examination for 1706 newborns born after the disaster in the affected (n = 836) and less-affected (n = 870) areas. Postpartum examinations took place 1 month after birth. Feeding method trends were examined, and multivariate regression analyses were used to investigate effects on newborn mass gain. There were no significant differences in background characteristics among newborns in these areas. When birth dates were divided into four periods to assess trends, no significant change in the exclusive breastfeeding rate was found, while the exclusive formula-feeding rate was significantly different across time periods in the affected area (p = 0.02). Multivariate analyses revealed no significant independent associations of maternal depression and change in medical facilities (possible disaster effects) with other newborn growth factors in either area. No area differences in newborn growth at the first postpartum examination or in exclusive breastfeeding rates were found during any period. Exclusive formula-feeding rates varied across time periods in the affected, but not in the less-affected area. It is concluded that effective guidance to promote breast-feeding and prevent exclusive use of formula is important for women in post-disaster circumstances.

AB  - The Fukushima Health Management Survey (FHMS) was established in response to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident on March 11, 2011. The primary objectives of the study are to monitor residents' long-term health and promote their future well-being, and to determine the health effects of long-term low-dose radiation exposure. This special issue summarizes the results and current status of the FHMS and discusses the challenges and future directions of the FHMS. The FHMS, a cohort study of all people who were residents in Fukushima Prefecture at the time of the accident, consists of a Basic Survey, Thyroid Ultrasound Examination, Comprehensive Health Check, Mental Health and Lifestyle Survey, and Pregnancy and Birth Survey. The radiation exposure was estimated based on the behavioral records examined using the Basic Survey. Although the response rate was low in the Basic Survey, the representativeness of the radiation exposure data was confirmed using additional surveys. There appears to be no relationship between the radiation exposure and risk of thyroid cancer, although more thyroid cancer cases were detected than initially expected. The ongoing Comprehensive Health Check and Mental Health and Lifestyle Survey have provided evidence of worsening physical and mental health status. The Pregnancy and Birth Survey showed rates of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and congenital abnormalities similar to the national average. Considering the above evidence, the Fukushima Prefectural Government decided to end the Pregnancy and Birth Survey at the end of March 2021, as recommended by the Prefectural Oversight Committee. The framework of the FHMS has not changed, but the FHMS needs to adapt according to the survey results and the changing needs of the eligible residents and municipalities.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of Tornado and Hilal (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) hysteroscopic proximal tubal occlusion (HPTO) for hydrosalpinx (HX) treatment before in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET) in patients with dense pelvic adhesions or low ovarian reserve.
   Design: A retrospective study of patients treated between May 2014 and May 2016 (Canadian Task Force classification III).
   Setting: A university-affiliated center.
   Patients: One hundred fifty women with unilateral or bilateral HX who were not candidates for laparoscopic surgery.
   Intervention: Tornado or Hilal HPTO before IVF-ET and/or frozen ET.
   Measurements and Main Results: The main outcome was the cumulative live birth rate. Tornado or Hilal placement was successful for 143 (95.3%) patients. Of the 132 patients who underwent 204 ET cycles, 86 (65.2%) conceived, and 78 (59.1%) resulted in live births. The overall early and late miscarriage rates per clinical pregnancy were 12.8% and 1.1%, respectively. The ectopic pregnancy rate was 2.3%. No major complications occurred.
   Conclusion: Tornado or Hilal HPTO is an effective alternative for treating HX before IVF-ET/frozen ET in patients with dense pelvic adhesions or low ovarian reserve. (C) 2018 AAGL. All rights reserved.

AB  - This review summarizes the literature to date on the subject of the chronobiology of blood pressure in pregnancy, and more specifically, in the common disease state of high blood pressure in pregnancy or preeclampsia. While the guidelines for treating hypertension in pregnancy use absolute measures to start treatment, they do not take into account the important rhythms of hypertension including nighttime and daytime readings. These variations are likely to have strong impacts on pregnancy outcomes, risk and long-term hypertension risk.

AB  - (1) Background: The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis links adverse fetal exposures with developmental mal-adaptations and morbidity later in life. Shortand long-term exposures to air pollutants are known contributors to health outcomes; however, the potential for developmental health effects of air pollution exposures during gestation or earlychildhood have yet to be reviewed and synthesized from a DOHaD lens. The objective of this study is to summarize the literature on cardiovascular and metabolic, respiratory, allergic, and neuropsychological health outcomes, from prenatal development through early childhood, associated with early-life exposures to outdoor air pollutants, including traffic-related and wildfire-generated air pollutants. (2) Methods: We conducted a search using PubMed and the references of articles previously known to the authors. We selected papers that investigated health outcomes during fetal or childhood development in association with early-life ambient or source-specific air pollution exposure. (3) Results: The current literature reports that prenatal and early-childhood exposures to ambient and traffic-related air pollutants are associated with a range of adverse outcomes in early life, including cardiovascular and metabolic, respiratory and allergic, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Very few studies have investigated associations between wildfire-related air pollution exposure and health outcomes during prenatal, postnatal, or childhood development. (4) Conclusion: Evidence from January 2000 to January 2022 supports a role for prenatal and early-childhood air pollution exposures adversely affecting health outcomes during development. Future studies are needed to identify both detrimental air pollutants from the exposure mixture and critical exposure time periods, investigate emerging exposure sources such as wildfire, and develop feasible interventional tools.

AB  - Background. The terrorist explosions of the World Trade Center in New York City and the other events on the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania on 11 September 2001 were stressful events that affected people around the world. Pregnant women and their offspring are especially vulnerable during and after such a terrorist attack. The objective was to systematically review the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes after the terrorist attacks on Sept 11, 2001. Methods. The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) criteria were used for reporting of this review. Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.0. Results. Ten reports of low-to-moderate risk of methodological bias were included. There was increased risks of infants with birthweight of 1,500 g-1,999 g (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.67 [95%CI 1.11-2.52]) and small-for-gestational age births (AOR 1.90; 95%CI 1.05-3.46) in New York. There was increased risks of low birthweight (relative risk 2.25; 95%CI 1.29-3.90) and preterm births (relative risk 1.50; 95%CI 1.06-2.14) among ethnically Arabic women living in California There was a reduction in birthweight by 276 g and in head circumference by 1 cm when DNA adducts, a marker for environmental toxin exposure, were doubled in maternal blood. In Holland, a 48-g reduction in birthweight was reported. Conclusions. The World Trade Center disaster influenced pregnancy outcomes in New York, among ethnically Arab women living in California and among Dutch women. The adverse outcomes are likely due to environmental pollution and stress in New York, ethnic harassment in California and communal bereavement and stress in Holland.

AB  - Simultaneous exposure to natural calamities and conflict shocks is a phenomenon that has been largely understudied. The interplay between natural disasters and conflict shocks can have adverse effects extending beyond the current family members to children in utero. The current paper tries to fill this gap by investigating the impact of floods on pregnancy and birth outcomes across conflict-affected and unaffected districts in Pakistan. Using mother fixed effects strategy, the results suggest that in-utero exposure to violence during flood increases the probability of small birth size by 4.7 percentage points. Moreover, simultaneous exposure to flood and violence increases the probability of miscarriages and stillbirths by 6 and 1.9 percentage points, respectively. Significant heterogeneities are found across income groups and education levels.

AB  - Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense on a global scale, raising concerns about their acute and long-term effects on human health. We conducted a systematic review of the current epidemiological evidence on wildfire health risks and a meta-analysis to investigate the association between wildfire smoke exposure and various health outcomes. We discovered that wildfire smoke increases the risk of premature deaths and respiratory morbidity in the general population. Meta-analysis of cause-specific mortality and morbidity revealed that wildfire smoke had the strongest associations with cardiovascular mortality (RR: 1.018, 95% CI: 1.014-1.021), asthma hospitalization (RR: 1.054, 95% CI: 1.026-1.082), and asthma emergency department visits (RR: 1.117, 95% CI: 1.035-1.204) in the general population. Subgroup analyses of age found that adults and elderly adults were more susceptible to the cardiopulmonary effects of wildfire smoke. Next, we systematically addressed the toxicological mechanisms of wildfire smoke, including direct toxicity, oxidative stress, inflammatory reactions, immune dysregulation, genotoxicity and mutations, skin allergies, inflammation, and others. We discuss wildfire smoke risk mitigation strategies including public health interventions, regulatory measures, and personal actions. We conclude by highlighting current research limitations and future directions for wildfire research, such as elucidating the complex interactions of wildfire smoke components on human health, developing personalized risk assessment tools, and improving resilience and adaptation strategies to mitigate the health effects of wildfires in changing climate.

KW  - TRENDS
AB  - Preterm birth is a major public health problem, especially in Puerto Rico where the rates are among the highest observed worldwide, reaching 18% in 2011. The Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) study is an ongoing investigation of environmental factors that contribute to this condition. In the present analysis, we sought to examine common risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse birth outcomes which have not been characterized previously in this unique population. Pregnant women from the PROTECT cohort are recruited from the heavily contaminated Northern coast of the island of Puerto Rico and are free of pre-existing conditions like diabetes. We examined associations between basic demographic, behavioral (e.g., tobacco and alcohol use), and pregnancy (e.g., season and year of delivery) characteristics as well as municipality of residence in relation to preterm birth (< 37 weeks gestation), postterm birth (>= 41 weeks gestation), and small and large for gestational age in univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Between 2011 and 2017, 1028 live singleton births were delivered as part of the PROTECT cohort. Of these, 107 (10%) were preterm. Preterm birth rates were higher among women with low socioeconomic status, as indicated by education level and income, and among women with high pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Odds ratios of small for gestational age delivery were higher for women who reported tobacco use in pregnancy and lower for women who delivered in the hurricane and dengue season (July-October). Overall, in pregnant women residing in Puerto Rico, socioeconomic status was associated with preterm birth but few other factors were associated with this or other adverse outcomes of pregnancy. Research to understand environmental factors that could be contributing to the preterm birth epidemic in Puerto Rico is necessary.

AB  - Wildfires have significant effects on human populations worldwide. Smoke pollution, in particular, from either prescribed burns or uncontrolled wildfires, can have profound health impacts, such as reducing birth weight in children and aggravating respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. Scarcity in the measurements of particulate matter responsible for these public health issues makes addressing the problem of smoke dispersion challenging, especially when fires occur in remote regions. Previous research has shown that in the case of the 2014 King fire in California, crowdsourced data can be useful in estimating particulate pollution from wildfire smoke. In this paper, we show that the previous model continues to provide good estimates when extended statewide to cover several wildfires over an entire season in California. Moreover, adding the semantic information contained in the social media data to the predictive model significantly increases model accuracy, indicating a confluence of social and spatio-temporal data.

AB  - Background: Wildfires in the Western United States are a growing and significant source of air pollution that is eroding decades of progress in air pollution reduction. The effects on preterm birth during critical periods of pregnancy are unknown. Methods: We assessed associations between prenatal exposure to wildland fire smoke and risk of preterm birth (gestational age < 37 weeks). We assigned smoke exposure to geocoded residence at birth for all live singleton births in California conceived 2007-2018, using weekly average concentrations of particulate matter <= 2.5 <mu>m (PM2.5) attributable to wildland fires from United States Environmental Protection Agency's Community Multiscale Air Quality Model. Logistic regression yielded odds ratio (OR) for preterm birth in relation to increases in average exposure across the whole pregnancy, each trimester, and each week of pregnancy. Models adjusted for season, age, education, race/ethnicity, medical insurance, and smoking of the birthing parent. Results: For the 5,155,026 births, higher wildland fire PM2.5 exposure averaged across pregnancy, or any trimester, was associated with higher odds of preterm birth. The OR for an increase of 1 mu g/m(3) of average wildland fire PM2.5 during pregnancy was 1.013 (95 % CI:1.008,1.017). Wildland fire PM2.5 during most weeks of pregnancy was associated with higher odds. Strongest estimates were observed in weeks in the second and third trimesters. A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in average wildland fire PM2<middle dot>5 in gestational week 23 was associated with OR = 1.034; 95 % CI: 1.019, 1.049 for preterm birth. Conclusions: Preterm birth is sensitive to wildland fire PM2.5; therefore, we must reduce exposure during pregnancy.

AB  - This paper studies the impact of wildfire smoke on workplace injuries among agricultural workers, using workers' compensation claims between 2007 and 2020. We find a substantial increase in agricultural-worker injuries attributable to smoke-induced PM2.5 and wildfire smoke. Specifically, a 10 mu g/m3 increase in daily PM2.5 exposure from wildfire smoke increases traumatic injuries by 2.9% and respiratory and cardiovascular injuries by 18.97%. We examine nonlinearities in the dose-response relationship and find that the health impacts of PM2.5 vary across concentration levels. The effects of smoke on traumatic injuries are largest among the oldest workers (aged 60 and above) and the youngest workers (under 30), relative to those in middle age. We find that injuries occur even at levels of PM2.5 deemed safe under current regulations. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that in 2020 alone, wildfire smoke was responsible for approximately 244 additional agricultural worker injuries in California compared to a hypothetical scenario without smoke.

AB  - Wildfire smoke is an increasing environmental health threat to which children are particularly vulnerable, for both physiologic and behavioral reasons. To address the need for improved public health messaging this review summarizes current knowledge and knowledge gaps in the health effects of wildfire smoke in children, as well as tools for public health response aimed at children, including consideration of low-cost sensor data, respirators, and exposures in school environments. There is an established literature of health effects in children from components of ambient air pollution, which are also present in wildfire smoke, and an emerging literature on the effects of wildfire smoke, particularly for respiratory outcomes. Low-cost particulate sensors demonstrate the spatial variability of pollution, including wildfire smoke, where children live and play. Surgical masks and respirators can provide limited protection for children during wildfire events, with expected decreases of roughly 20% and 80% for surgical masks and N95 respirators, respectively. Schools should improve filtration to reduce exposure of our nation's children to smoke during wildfire events. The evidence base described may help clinical and public health authorities provide accurate information to families to improve their decision making.

AB  - The increase in wildfires and bushfires due to climate change means that more people, including pregnant women and their fetuses will be exposed to landscape fire smoke. Although there is evidence to suggest that pregnancy landscape fire exposure is associated with lower birth weight, preterm birth and pregnancy loss, there is a lack of information on many other perinatal outcomes, as well as information on subsequent respiratory outcomes in children. Furthermore, due to the generally short term (hours/days) and intermittent nature of landscape fire smoke exposure, the knowledge to date has largely relied on natural experiments and ecological studies which can be subject to misclassification of exposure and a lack of precision. On the other hand, general urban outdoor air pollution exposure during pregnancy and subsequent perinatal and respiratory effects has been well studied. In particular, as air exposure modelling has improved so have the adaptations of methods to analyze the effects of air pollution exposure during pregnancy enabling critical windows of exposure to be identified. In this narrative review we summarize the current state of knowledge about the perinatal and respiratory effects of pregnancy landscape fire and particulate matter <2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5) air pollution exposure, including a comment on analysis methods to date, and an assessment of how methodologies used in general air pollution research in relation to pregnancy exposure can be further harnessed for landscape fire smoke exposure pregnancy research.

AB  - Introduction. Wildfire activity is intensifying in Latin America due to climate and land-use changes, but the health impacts of wildfire-derived PM2.5 in urban areas remain poorly quantified and recognized. Objective. To assess the evidence on wildfire-related PM2.5 and its association with mortality and morbidity in Latin American cities. Materials and methods. We conducted a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines, using data from PubMed, Scopus, and Bireme. One reviewer independently screened 163 articles and extracted data from 14 eligible studies. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results. Most studies were conducted in Brazil (n = 12) and used time-series or modelling designs to estimate health risks. Wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure was associated with all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Reported effect estimates ranged from 1.7 to 7.7% increases in risk per 10 mu g/m3 of exposure. Other studies assessed preterm birth, COVID-19 outcomes, and site-specific cancers. While two studies provided harmonized RR estimates for all-cause mortality, high heterogeneity and methodological differences prevented formal meta-analysis. Conclusion. Wildfire smoke contributes measurably to premature mortality in Latin America, but current evidence is unevenly distributed across regions, time periods, and population subgroups. Studies rarely capture the disproportionate risks faced by indigenous and rural communities or the intraurban disparities linked to poverty and geography. Future research should focus on the health burden of morbidity linked to wildfire PM2.5.

AB  - The history of Ceara has been marked by droughts and their consequences that have generated (and generate) migrations and expressive human mortality. Our objective is to analyze the second half of the 19(th) century, especially, the drought between 1877-1879, known as the "great drought", seeking to comprehend how the government, from this period, started to understand the poverty, the assistance and the charity aimed to migrants' aid who left the rural areas to the urban ones in search of assistance from the public power, which performed within the perspective of control and discipline. We also seek to show the meaningful rise in the infant mortality rates because the children suffered the most with the starvation and high temperatures and, as the theme is an issue rarely explored in the Cearense literature.

AB  - Background: Disasters are associated with worse perinatal outcomes, perhaps due to inadequate prenatal care (PNC). Methods: Using 2017-2019 Florida vital statistics, we compared PNC use before and after Hurricane Michael. We categorized counties as most affected (Area A) or less affected (Area B and C). We examined whether Michael's effects on perinatal outcomes varied by maternity care availability and used the Baron and Kenny method to assess whether delayed PNC initiation mediated perinatal outcomes. Log-binomial regression and semi-parametric linear regression were used, controlling for maternal and ZIP code tabulation area characteristics. Results: Compared to the one-year period pre-Michael, the week of the first PNC was later in all areas in the one-year period post-Michael, with the largest change in Area A (adjusted difference 0.112, 95% CI: 0.055-0.169), where women were less likely to receive PNC overall (aRR = 0.994, 95% CI = 0.990-0.998) and more likely to have inadequate PNC (aRR = 1.193, 95% CI = 1.127-1.264). Michael's effects on perinatal outcomes did not vary significantly by maternity care availability within Area A. Delayed PNC initiation appeared to mediate an increased risk in small for gestational age (SGA) births after Michael. Conclusion: Women in Area A initiated PNC later and had a higher likelihood of inadequate PNC. Delayed PNC initiation may partially explain increased risk of SGA.

AB  - Background: Wildfire activity is predicted to increase in many parts of the world due to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns from global climate change. Wildfire smoke contains numerous hazardous air pollutants and many studies have documented population health effects from this exposure.
   Objectives: We aimed to assess the evidence of health effects from exposure to wildfire smoke and to identify susceptible populations. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature for studies of wildfire smoke exposure on mortality and on respiratory, cardiovascular, mental, and perinatal health. Within those reviewed papers deemed to have minimal risk of bias, we assessed the coherence and consistency of findings.
   Discussion: Consistent evidence documents associations between wildfire smoke exposure and general respiratory health effects, specifically exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Growing evidence suggests associations with increased risk of respiratory infections and all-cause mortality. Evidence for cardiovascular effects is mixed, but a few recent studies have reported associations for specific cardiovascular end points. Insufficient research exists to identify specific population subgroups that are more susceptible to wildfire smoke exposure.
   Conclusions: Consistent evidence from a large number of studies indicates that wildfire smoke exposure is associated with respiratory morbidity with growing evidence supporting an association with all-cause mortality. More research is needed to clarify which causes of mortality may be associated with wildfire smoke, whether cardiovascular outcomes are associated with wildfire smoke, and if certain populations are more susceptible.

AB  - The November 2018 Camp fire was the most destructive wildfire in California history, but its effects on reproductive health are not known. We linked California birth records from 2017-2019 to daily smoke levels using US EPA Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 data and NOAA Hazard Mapping System smoke plume polygons during the Camp fire. In the main analysis, pregnancies were considered exposed if they had median AQS PM2.5 levels above 50 mu g/m3 for at least 7 days during November 8-22, 2018. We calculated rates of preterm birth and the infant sex ratio based on week of conception and used the generalized synthetic control method to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated and to propose a novel approach to identify potential critical weeks of exposure during pregnancy. We found associations between Camp fire-related smoke exposure and rates of preterm birth, with a risk difference (RD) of 0.005 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.001-0.010. Exposure during week 10 of pregnancy was consistently associated with increased preterm birth (RD, 0.030; 95% CI, 0.004-0.056). We did not observe differences in the infant sex ratio. Camp fire smoke exposure was associated with increased rates of preterm birth, with sensitive windows in the first trimester.This article is part of a Special Collection on Environmental Epidemiology.

AB  - Background Global climate change has led to an increase in the prevalence and severity of wildfires. Pollutants released into air, soil and groundwater from wildfires may impact embryo development leading to gastroschisis. Objective The objective of this study was to determine the association between wildfire exposure before and during pregnancy and the risk of foetal gastroschisis development. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study using The California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Linked Birth File linked to The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection data between 2007 and 2010. Pregnancies complicated by foetal gastroschisis were identified by neonatal hospital discharge ICD-9 code. Pregnancies were considered exposed to wildfire if the mother's primary residence zip code was within 15 miles to the closest edge of a wildfire. The exposure was further stratified by trimester or if exposed within 30 days prior to pregnancy. Multivariable log-binomial regression analyses were performed to estimate the association between wildfire exposure in each pregnancy epoch and foetal gastroschisis. Results Between 2007 and 2010, 844,348 (40%) births were exposed to wildfire in California. Compared with births without wildfire exposure, those with first-trimester exposure were associated with higher rates of gastroschisis, 7.8 vs. 5.7 per 10,000 births (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07, 1.54). Furthermore, those with prepregnancy wildfire exposure were also found to have higher rates of gastroschisis, 12.5 vs. 5.7 per 10,000 births, (aRR 2.17, 95% CI 1.42, 3.52). In contrast, second- and third-trimester wildfire exposures were not associated with foetal gastroschisis. Conclusions Wildfire exposure within 30 days before pregnancy was associated with more than two times higher risk of foetal gastroschisis, whereas a 28% higher risk was demonstrated if exposure was in the first trimester.

AB  - The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river basin, running through Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and northern India, is home to more than 618 million people. Annual monsoons bring extensive flooding to the basin, with floods predicted to be more frequent and extreme due to climate change. Yet, evidence regarding the long-term impacts of floods on children's health is lacking. In this analysis, we used high-resolution maps of recent large floods in Bangladesh to identify flood-prone areas over the country. We then used propensity score techniques to identify, among 58,945 mothers interviewed in six demographic population-based surveys throughout Bangladesh, matched cohorts of exposed and unexposed mothers and leverage data on 150,081 births to estimate that living in flood-prone areas was associated with an excess risk in infant mortality of 5.3 (95% CI 2.2 to 8.4) additional deaths per 1,000 births compared to living in non-flood-prone areas over the 30-y period between 1988 and 2017, with higher risk for children born during rainy (7.9, 95% CI: 3.3 to 12.5) vs. dry months (3.1, 95% CI: -1.1 to 7.2). Finally, drawing on national-scale, high-resolution estimates of flood risk and population distribution, we estimated an excess of 152,753 (64,120 to 241,386) infant deaths were attributable to living in flood-prone areas in Bangladesh over the past 30 y, with marked heterogeneity in attributable burden by subdistrict. Our approach demonstrates the importance of measuring longer-term health impacts from floods and provides a generalizable example for how to study climate-related exposures and long-term health effects.

AB  - Purpose: This study outlines the evolution of a pediatric field hospital after the January 2010 Haiti earthquake.
   Methods: Project Medishare set up a field hospital in Port-au-Prince 48 hours after the event. Our institution staffed the pediatric component for 45 days, with sequential deployment of 9 volunteer medical teams. Evolving facility and manpower requirements and changing patient demographics over time were evaluated.
   Results: Delegations consisted of surgeons, pediatricians, nurses, operating room (OR) personnel, physical therapists, pharmacists, and support staff. Primary goals involved creation of a child-specific ward, pediatric OR, and a wound care center. Major inpatient demographic changes occurred as time from the disaster elapsed. Initial census showed that 93% of the patients were surgical admissions with 40% undergoing operations, mostly fracture and wound care, over the first week. Eight weeks later, medical illnesses accounted for 70% of inpatients, whereas OR volume dropped by more than 50%. A second trend involved increasing acuity of care. Initially, children were admitted for serious or limb-threatening, but usually not life-threatening, injuries. Within 2 months, one third of the patients were housed in the developing NICU/PICU; and only 12% were admitted for injuries related to the earthquake. This change in patient needs led to alterations in facility requirements and in staffing and leadership needs.
   Conclusion: A disaster involving significant casualties in a populated area demands the rapid development of a field facility with pediatric personnel. Requirements for equipment, manpower, medical records, and systems addressing volunteer stress and ethical dilemmas can be anticipated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many women are occupationally active during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between exposure to chemicals during pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes or preeclampsia. The cohort included singleton births in Sweden between 1994 and 2014. The cohort was limited to low-educated mothers to reduce potential confounding from unidentified life-style associated factors. Information on occupation (full-time employed) at beginning of pregnancy, demographic data, education, personal risk factors and medical diagnoses were obtained from national records. Occupational exposure to 20 chemicals/particles was assessed by a timespecific job exposure matrix (SweJEM). Relative risks (RR) were adjusted for birth year of the child and mother's age, parity, country of birth, smoking, BMI, and occupational exposure to physical strain, low decision authority, noise, and whole-body vibrations. There were 307,985 births in the cohort. The risk of preeclampsia was elevated after exposure to diesel engine exhaust (RR 1.19; 95 % CI 1.03-1.37), gasoline engine exhaust (RR 1.26; 1.05-1.52) or to carbon monoxide (RR 1.21; 1.03-1.42). Exposure to lead was associated with an elevated risk of gestational diabetes, (RR 2.41; 1.05-5.55), based on six cases only, though. An elevated risk of preeclampsia in association with combustion products is corroborated by studies of traffic-related urban air pollution and of smoke from wildfires. Exposure to motor exhaust during pregnancy should be minimised. Exposure to lead during pregnancy should be avoided also because of serious neurodevelopmental effects for the child.

AB  - Ecological and social factors have a significant effect on infant survivorship in nonhuman primates. We present 6293 group-months of infant birth and mortality data for 29 groups of Alouatta caraya inhabiting a flooded forest in northeastern Argentina, collected over 1.5-8 yr depending on the group. We tested whether infant mortality was a response to the effects of flooding on food availability and whether male takeovers resulted in greater opportunities for infanticide. During our study, 43 of 113 infants died at a mean age of 5 mo. In 24 cases the cause of death was unknown. In the remaining 19 cases infant deaths were attributed to periods of intense flooding (N = 8), replacement of the breeding male (N = 8), problems associated with birth (N = 2), and injuries during an intergroup encounter (N = 1). Flooding reduced the availability of mature leaves, which appeared to play an important role in the ability of mothers to nurse their offspring. Male replacements occurred in four social groups that contained only one fully adult male. Infant mortality was significantly higher in groups that experienced male replacement compared to groups without male replacement. These results indicate that infant mortality in Alouatta caraya is affected by several factors-natural disasters, maternal condition and food availability, infanticide after male replacement, and possibly disease and predation-each of which needs to be evaluated to understand the history and demography of this primate population.

AB  - In theoretical research on disaster vulnerability, access to resources is critical for optimal outcomes. Studying the impact of a hurricane on maternal stress can expand theories of disaster vulnerability. This is a cross-sectional mixed-methods prospective study of maternal stress during Hurricane Florence in the United States. Results from chi-squares compared the proportion of respondents who reported having support for a financial emergency were significant, specifically that higher income respondents indicated the ability to rely on someone in case of an emergency. A regression analysis indicated that social support was significant and negatively related to stress as a dependent variable, while evacuation status and pregnancy status were not significant predictors of stress. Five themes emerged from the overall qualitative data: concerns about infant feeding, evacuation logistics, general stress, family roles, and 'other' issues.

AB  - Objective. This study investigates the trend of perinatal mortality rates in Fukushima Prefecture and four neighboring prefectures (Miyagi, Gunma, Tochigi, and Ibaraki) after the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011. Material and methods. Japanese monthly perinatal mortality data on a prefecture level are available on a website of the Japanese government. A combined regression of perinatal mortality rates from the study region and the rest of Japan (the control region) is conducted. The regression model allows for an asymptotic lower limit and a level change of perinatal mortality rates in 2012-2017 in the study region relative to the predicted trend. Results. In 2012-2017, perinatal mortality in the study region shows a significant 10.6% increase relative to the trend in preceding years (p = 0.006). The excess mortality translates to 195 (95% CI: 28, 462) excess perinatal deaths. The increase is three times greater in Fukushima Prefecture than in the four neighboring prefectures and the difference in excess rates is statistically significant (p = 0.010). Periodic peaks of perinatal mortality are found in 2012-2017 with maxima around April. Conclusion. We find an increase in perinatal mortality in Fukushima and four neighboring prefectures after the Fukushima nuclear accident. The results agree with similar observations in Germany and Ukraine after the Chernobyl disaster. Due to its ecological design, the study cannot prove a causal link between radiation exposure and perinatal mortality. Continued observation of the trend of perinatal mortality in contaminated regions of Japan is recommended.

AB  - Tropical cyclones (TCs) pose substantial health risks to infants, particularly those living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the extent to which TCs affect infant survival in LMICs is not well understood. We examined the impact of TC exposure on infant mortality by linking recently developed TC wind field data with 1,682,249 nationally representative infant survival records from 2002 to 2021 across seven LMICs. We found that, on average, exposure to TCs in utero or in the first year of life led to 4.4 additional infant deaths per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 8.4; 11% increase compared to the sample average infant mortality rate). This average effect was mainly driven by excess mortality in Bangladesh, Dominican Republic, and Haiti, with small and statistically insignificant effects in all other study countries. Further investigation is warranted to understand the mechanisms through which TCs affect infant mortality and why some countries' children fare better after TC exposure than others.

AB  - In Norway, external doses of radiation resulting from fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear accident were estimated from detailed measurements, including soil deposition patterns. Internal doses were estimated from measurements of radioactive cesium in meat and milk supplies. The doses were calculated as average monthly doses for each of 454 municipalities during 36 consecutive months after the accident in spring 1986. Prospectively collected data on all newborns listed in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway who were conceived in the period May 1983-April 1989 were used to assess possible dose-response relations between estimated external and food-based exposures and congenital malformations and some other conditions. A positive association was observed between total radiation dose (external plus food-based) and hydrocephaly, while a negative association was observed for Down's syndrome. However, an important conclusion of the study was that no associations were found for conditions previously reported to be associated with radiation, i.e., small head circumference, congenital cataracts, anencephaly, spina bifida, and low birth weight. Potential sources of bias, including exposure misclassification and incomplete ascertainment of cases, are discussed.

AB  - Emissions from wildfires worsen air quality and can adversely impact human health. This study utilized the fire inven-tory from NCAR (FINN) as wildfire emissions, and performed air quality modeling of April-October 2012, 2013, and 2014 using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency CMAQ model under two cases: with and without wildfire emissions. This study then assessed the health impacts and economic values attributable to PM2.5 from fires. Results indicated that wildfires could lead annually to 4000 cases of premature mortality in the U.S., corresponding to $36 billion losses. Regions with high concentrations of fire-induced PM2.5 were in the west (e.g., Idaho, Montana, and northern California) and Southeast (e.g., Alabama, Georgia). Metropolitan areas located near fire sources, exhibited large health burdens, such as Los Angeles (119 premature deaths, corresponding to $1.07 billion), Atlanta (76, $0.69 billion), and Houston (65, $0.58 billion). Regions in the downwind of western fires, although experiencing relatively low values of fire-induced PM2.5, showed notable health burdens due to their large population, such as met-ropolitan areas of New York (86, $0.78 billion), Chicago (60, $0.54 billion), and Pittsburgh (32, $0.29 billion). Results suggest that impacts from wildfires are substantial, and to mitigate these impacts, better forest management and more resilient infrastructure would be needed.

AB  - Global climate change has transformed predictions of fire seasons in the near future, and record-breaking wildfire events have had catastrophic consequences in recent years. In September 2020, multiple wildfires subjected Oregon to hazardous air quality for several days. In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to examine prenatal loss, morbidity, and mortality of rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) exposed to poor air quality from the nearby wildfires. Detailed medical records from 2014 to 2020 of 580 macaques housed outdoors at a research facility in Beaverton, Oregon were used to evaluate the association between these health outcomes and wildfire smoke exposure. Logistic regression models estimated excess prenatal loss, hospitalization rates, respiratory problems, and mortality during and following the wildfire event, and Kruskal-Wallis statistics were used to determine if infant growth was affected by wildfire smoke exposure. Risk of pregnancy loss (relative risk = 4.1; p < 0.001) and odds of diagnosis with a respiratory problem (odds ratio = 4.47; p = 0.003) were higher in exposed infant macaques compared to nonexposed infants. Infant growth was not affected by poor air quality exposure. Our findings suggest wildfire smoke exposure poses a risk to the health of infants and pregnant individuals and should be monitored more closely in the future.

AB  - Background: Climate change is likely to increase the threat of wildfires, and little is known about how wildfires affect health in exposed communities. A better understanding of the impacts of the resulting air pollution has important public health implications for the present day and the future.
   Method: We performed a systematic search to identify peer-reviewed scientific studies published since 1986 regarding impacts of wildfire smoke on health in exposed communities. We reviewed and synthesized the state of science of this issue including methods to estimate exposure, and identified limitations in current research.
   Results: We identified 61 epidemiological studies linking wildfire and human health in communities. The U.S. and Australia were the most frequently studied countries (18 studies on the U.S., 15 on Australia). Geographic scales ranged from a single small city (population about 55,000) to the entire globe. Most studies focused on areas close to fire events. Exposure was most commonly assessed with stationary air pollutant monitors (35 of 61 studies). Other methods included using satellite remote sensing and measurements from air samples collected during fires. Most studies compared risk of health outcomes between 1) periods with no fire events and periods during or after fire events, or 2) regions affected by wildfire smoke and unaffected regions. Daily pollution levels during or after wildfire in most studies exceeded U.S. EPA regulations. Levels of PM10, the most frequently studied pollutant, were 1.2 to 10 times higher due to wildfire smoke compared to non-fire periods and/or locations. Respiratory disease was the most frequently studied health condition, and had the most consistent results. Over 90% of these 45 studies reported that wildfire smoke was significantly associated with risk of respiratory morbidity.
   Conclusion: Exposure measurement is a key challenge in current literature on wildfire and human health. A limitation is the difficulty of estimating pollution specific to wildfires. New methods are needed to separate air pollution levels of wildfires from those from ambient sources, such as transportation. The majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with increased risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Children, the elderly and those with underlying chronic diseases appear to be susceptible. More studies on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are needed. Further exploration with new methods could help ascertain the public health impacts of wildfires under climate change and guide mitigation policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change is a major threat to the world's population and is due to global warming from human activities that increase atmospheric greenhouse gas levels-burning fossil fuels, industry emissions, vehicular exhaust, and aerosol chlorofluorocarbons-that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and adversely impact air quality. Resulting higher global temperatures, extreme weather events, and rising sea levels lead to greater frequency of wildfires and floods, which, in turn, result in population displacements and threaten air and water quality, food and water security, economic and public health infrastructures, and societal safety. Climate change has direct and indirect impacts on human health and well-being across the globe, with disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations including women, pregnant persons, the developing fetus, children, older adults, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, preexisting and/or chronic medical conditions, and low income and communities of color. As consequences of climate change, global mortality and noncommunicable diseases are mounting because of lack of progress to reverse current trends. Climate change effects on reproductive processes and outcomes have received less attention globally, despite huge consequences for human development, fertility, and pregnancy outcomes. This review provides evidence for direct and indirect effects of climate change on human health with a focus on reproductive processes and outcomes based on experimental models and epidemiologic data, and strategies to mitigate harms. The goal is to increase awareness about climate effects on reproductive health among clinicians, researchers, the public, and policymakers, and to engage all stakeholders to change the current trajectory of harm.

AB  - Background: Past research on the impact of climatic events, such as drought, on birth outcomes has primarily been focused in Africa, with less research in South Asia, including Nepal. Existing evidence has generally found that drought impacts birthweight and infant sex, with differences by trimester. Additionally, less research has looked at the impact of excess rain on birth outcomes or focused on the impact of rainfall extremes in the preconception period. Using data from a large demographic surveillance system in Nepal, combined with a novel measure of drought/excess rainfall, we explore the impact of these on birthweight by time in pregnancy.
   Methods: Using survey data from the 2016 to 2019 Chitwan Valley Study in rural Nepal combined with data from Climate Hazards InfraRed Precipitation with Station, we explored the association between excess rainfall and drought and birthweight, looking at exposure in the preconception period, and by trimester of pregnancy. We also explore the impact of excess rainfall and drought on infant sex and delivery with a skilled birth attendant. We used multilevel regressions and explored for effect modification by maternal age.
   Results: Drought in the first trimester is associated with lower birthweight (beta = -82.9 g; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 164.7, -1.2) and drought in the preconception period with a high likelihood of having a male (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.01, 2.01). Excess rainfall in the first trimester is associated with high birthweight (beta = 111.6g; 95% CI = 20.5, 202.7) and higher odds of having a male (OR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.02, 2.16), and in the third trimester with higher odds of low birth weight (OR = 2.50; 95% CI = 1.40, 4.45).
   Conclusions: Increasing rainfall extremes will likely impact birth outcomes and could have implications for sex ratios at birth.

AB  - Climate change is increasing the intensity of extreme weather events. Health is a primary channel through which climate change affects welfare. Yet, estimates of the mitigating effects of health system strengthening are largely missing. We combine data from a randomized trial inducing variation in healthcare access with naturally-occurring variation in growing-season precipitation to study the adaptive impact of community healthcare in a low-income country setting. The risk of infant death increases following low growing-season rainfall, but access to community healthcare reduces this risk by 46 %. Using our estimates coupled with projections from climatological models implies even larger potential adaptive effects.

AB  - We investigate the risks presented by heat waves for adverse health conditions for babies and expectant mothers when these mothers have been exposed to heat waves during gestation or during the period just prior to conception. Rather than just birth weight and gestational age, we focus on less common metrics such as abnormal conditions in the newborn (fetal distress, reliance on a ventilator, and meconium aspiration) and adverse health conditions in the mother (pregnancy-related hypertension, uterine bleeding during pregnancy, eclampsia, and incompetent cervix). We use monthly panel data for over 3,000 U.S. counties, constructed from the confidential version of the U.S. Natality Files for 1989-2008. Our models control for sociodemographic factors and include county, month, and state-by-year fixed effects to control for unobserved spatial and timewise heterogeneity in the data. Even within the United States, where there is widespread access to air conditioning, heat waves increase the fraction of babies with abnormal conditions related to maternal stress, as well as the fraction of mothers who experience pregnancy-related adverse health conditions. The scope for these risks in developing countries is likely to be even greater.

AB  - Worster-Drought syndrome (WDS), or congenital suprabulbar paresis, is characterised by congenital dysarthria, dysphagia and other pseudobulbar paresis without structural abnormalities around the Sylvian fissure on imaging. This rare syndrome is challenging to diagnose, particularly in preterm infants. This report describes a low-birth-weight female infant with WDS who had no sucking reflex from birth, airway obstruction due to saliva retention and muscle rigidity, who was diagnosed with the syndrome at a postconceptional age (PCA) of 1 month. She was discharged with only home oxygen therapy as respiratory support at a PCA of 3 months after gradual improvement in her clinical symptoms. Diagnosis of WDS is difficult in the early postnatal period in preterm cases owing to prematurity but should be suspected when bulbar palsy, including absence of the sucking reflex, persistent dysphagia and obstructed breathing, persists beyond a PCA of 40 weeks and when muscle stiffness is present.

AB  - Background: The frequency and intensity of hurricane have increased greatly. However, whether hurricane exposure is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications is less known.
   Objective: To assess the immediate impact and lasting impact of Hurricane Sandy (Sandy) on pregnancy complications.
   Methods: Using time-series study, we estimated the relative risks (RRs) of emergency department (ED) visits for pregnancy complications in eight affected counties in New York State, based on data of 2005-2014. The immediate impact was estimated by comparing the ED visits of pregnancy complications during the Sandy period to the non-Sandy periods. For the lasting impact of Sandy, we estimated the RRs by contrasting the ED visits in the following 12 months after Sandy with the same months of other years.
   Results: We found that ED visits for overall pregnancy complications increased 6.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 22%, 10.5%) during the Sandy month. ED visits increased for threatened abortion (9.9%, 95% CI: 4.4%, 15.7%), threatened labor (10.1%, 95% CI: 1.9%, 18.9%), early onset of delivery (115.9%, 95% CI: 6.9%, 336.3%), renal disease (732%, 95% CI: 0.3%, 199.4%), and diabetes (423%, 95% CI: 15.0%, 76.0%). Gestational hypertension and renal disease were elevated 7-8 months after Sandy. The ED visits of mental illness increased gradually after Sandy and peaked eight months later with visits increasing 332%.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that hurricanes may impact pregnancy health immediately and that some negative health may last for months thereafter. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective Flood is an annual phenomenon in Assam. This study aims to understand the after flood effects on children in the worst flood-hit districts of Assam during the last decades most devastating flood where more than 1,00,000 people were affected. Study design A cross sectional population-based study was done covering 7512 children of 0-12 years of age in 35 worse flood-affected villages in three districts of lower Assam for nutritional risk profiling, low birth weight and morbidity pattern. Method Anthropometric measurements of the children were compared with standard WHO definitions for nutritional risk profiling. ANOVA was conducted to see any relationship of nutritional status between the age groups and BMI for the districts. Two-factor ANOVA to analyse the effect of ARI on the morbidity status of different districts was done. District-wise and village-wise heat maps were generated to understand different nutritional parameters for analysing which areas within each district are more affected and why. Results The moderate (< 2SD) and severely underweight (< 3SD) children under 5 years of age were highest in the Barpeta district (45.5% and 24.2% respectively). The moderate and severe stunting was highest in Morigaon (47.6%) and Barpeta (24.3%) respectively. The moderate and severe wasting was highest in the Morigaon district (46.1% and 20.6% respectively). All the nutritional indicators were less than the WHO standard. The age-wise and district-wise distribution of nutritional status shows variations in all three districts. Severe underweight was observed highest among 24-35 months' children (50.9%) in Barpeta. The moderate and severe undernutrition status was found to be higher among the age group of 10-12 years of age compared to 5 to 10 years. Conclusion This survey has provided a comprehensive picture of the nutritional status of the targeted children in the worst flood-affected areas. However, attention to its impact on health particularly among those exposed at very early stages in life is still lacking. This kind of rapid assessment helps to understand the health and nutritional status of the vulnerable groups in a deeper way and to plan robust region-specific interventions.

AB  - Strong institutions as well as economic development are gener-ally understood to play critical roles in protecting societies from the adverse impacts of natural hazards, such as tropical cyclones. The independent effect of institutions on reducing these risks, however, has not been confirmed empirically in previous global studies. As a storm's path and intensity influence the severity of the damages and may be spatially correlated with human vulnerabilities, failing to accurately capture physical exposure in an econometric analysis may result in imprecise and biased estimates of the influence of the independent variables. Here, we develop an approach to control for physical exposure by spatially interacting meteorological and socioeconomic data for over 1,000 tropical cyclone disasters from 1979 to 2016. We find evidence that higher levels of national government effectiveness are associated with lower tropical cyclone mortality, even when controlling for average income and other socioeconomic conditions. Within countries, deaths are higher when strong winds are concentrated over areas of the country with elevated infant mortality rates, an indicator of institutional effectiveness through public service delivery. These results suggest that policies and programs to enhance institutional capacity and governance can support risk reduction from extreme weather events.

AB  - Background: Pregnant people and infants are vulnerable to wildfire smoke. However, the availability of perinatal resources in communities impacted by smoke is unknown. Objective: Describe perinatal resources in counties prone to wildfire smoke. Research Study Design: Smoke data came from the Hazard Mapping System and perinatal resources were gathered from various sources. Choropleth maps described the geographic distribution of smoke. Unadjusted associations and multivariable regressions compared perinatal resource levels by smoke risk. Subgroup analysis of the most rural counties was conducted. Subjects: Counties in the contiguous United States (n=3108) during the 2016-2020 period. Measures: Relative smoke risk was defined as the bottom, middle, and top third of the average annual smoke-days distribution. Perinatal resources included driving distance to the nearest maternity care hospital and NICU, the volume and geographic isolation of the nearest maternity care hospital, and county-based measures of OB-GYN and family medicine physicians. Results: Average annual smoke-days ranged from 3.8 (SD=2.0) in low-risk to 15.3 (SD=5.5) in high-risk counties. Compared with low-risk counties, high-risk counties had fewer OB-GYNs per 10,000 births (-32.2, 95% CI: -45.7 to -20.6; P<0.001) and were farther to the nearest maternity hospital (10.1 miles, 95% CI: 8.7-11.5; P<0.001). High-risk counties were also farther to the nearest NICU. Associations were not explained by sociodemographics and were observed in the subset of the most rural counties. Conclusions: Communities prone to wildfire smoke often lack geographic access to the health care resources needed to treat pregnant people and infants in a timely manner.

AB  - Climate change is the most pressing challenge of the 21st century. It's immediate impacts on the environment are extreme weather conditions such as heatwaves, storms, rains, floods, sealevel rise, the disruption of crops, agricultural systems, water, vector-borne diseases, and ecosystems. The weather-related disasters disturbed the natural biological environment and dislocated millions of people from their homes. The extreme weather conditions caused the deaths of about two million people and $4.3 trillion in economic loss over the past half a century, and 90% of deaths were reported from developing countries. It has also been predicted that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is presumed to cause about 250,000 additional deaths per annum. The rapid rise in temperatures, frequencies of heat waves, wildfires, storms, and other weather extremes conditions could affect human health in many ways. The onedegree Celsius rise in outdoor temperature causes over 100,000 new cases of diabetes mellitus per annum. Climate change compromised body metabolism, vasodilation, sweating, insulin resistance and cause Type-2 diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes Mellitus.

AB  - Glycine has the greatest rate of deposition in whole-body proteins among all amino acids in neonates, but its provision from sow's milk meets only 20% of the requirement of suckling piglets. The results of our recent studies indicate that piglets with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) have a reduced ability to synthesize glycine. The present study determined the role of glycine in the growth of sow-reared IUGR piglets. In Experiment 1, 56 newborn piglets (postnatal day 0) with a low birth weight (<1.10 kg) were selected from 14 litters, providing 4 IUGR piglets/litter that were allotted randomly into one of four treatment groups (14 piglets/group). Piglets received oral administration of either 0, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 g glycine/kg body weight (BW) twice daily (i.e., 0, 0.2, 0.4 or 0.8 g glycine/kg BW/day) between 0 and 14 days of age. L-Alanine was used as the isonitrogenous control. The BWs of all piglets were recorded each week during the experiment. Two weeks after the initiation of glycine supplementation, blood and tissue samples were collected for biochemical analyses. In Experiment 2, rates of muscle protein synthesis in tissues were determined on day 14 using the H-3-phenylalanine flooding dose technique. Compared with piglets in the control group, oral administration of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 g glycine/kg BW/day did not affect their milk intake (p > 0.05) but increased (p < 0.05) concentrations of glycine in plasma by 1.52-, 1.94-, and 2.34-fold, respectively, and body weight by 20%, 37%, and 34%, respectively. The dose of 0.4 g glycine/kg BW/day was the most cost-effective. Consistent with its growth-promoting effect, glycine supplementation stimulated (p < 0.05) the phosphorylation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (p70(S6K)) as well as protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, compared with the control group. Collectively, oral administration of glycine activated the MTOR signaling pathway in skeletal muscle and enhanced the growth performance of IUGR piglets. These results indicate that endogenous synthesis of glycine is inadequate to meet the needs of IUGR piglets during the suckling period and that oral supplementation with glycine to these compromized neonates can improve their growth performance.

AB  - Objective: This study was undertaken to assess the health status of newborns discharged from Sick Newborn Care Units (SNCU) of the Cyclone Fani affected districts of Odisha, which is amongst the highest neonatal mortality rate states in the country. Methods: Cyclone Fani hit the coast of Odisha on May 3, 2019. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 5 districts and targeted the babies discharged from SNCU's from January to May 2019. A telephonic interview of the caregivers was conducted to assess the health status of the newborns. Data was collected in a web-based portal and analyzed by statistical package for social sciences SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). Results: We inquired about 1840 babies during the study period but only 875 babies could be followed up, with the highest proportion of the babies from the most affected district. Out of 875 babies, 111 (12.7%) had 1 or more illnesses during follow up. Distance from the health facility and time constraints were the major reasons for not seeking health care. Of the babies, 35.7% were reported as being underweight. Poor breastfeeding (14.1%) and kangaroo mother care (31.7%) practices were reported. Only 32% of the babies were completely immunized. Conclusion: The health status of the babies discharged from the SNCUs was found to be poor. Newborn care can be strengthened by improving home-based and facility-based newborn care.

AB  - In a community based survey of gestational diabetes in 18 rural villages of the eastern zone of Tigray administrative region, northern Ethiopia, a total of 890 pregnant women with gestational age of 24 weeks and above were examined for gestational diabetes mellitus based on WHO criteria. A 75 gm oral glucose tolerance test was performed on each subject with measurement of glucose at 0 and 2 h. Blood glucose was determined by glucose oxidase method using capillary blood (Accutrend alpha, Boehringer Mannheim). The mean age of the mothers was 27.4 +/- 7.1 years. Forty four percent of the subjects were multiparas. The prevalence rate of gestational diabetes mellitus was found to be 3.7% (95% CI 2.5-4.9). The mean blood glucose 2 h after glucose load in those pregnant diagnosed to have gestational diabetes mellitus was 154.6 +/- 14.4 mg/dl (J.W. Rich-Edwards, C.A. Colditz, M.J. Stampfer, W.C. Willett, M.W. Gillman, C. Hennekens, F.E. Speizer, J.E. Manson, Birth weight and the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adult women, Annu. Intern. Med. 130 (1999) 278-284). The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus in this region of the country is high as compared to other parts of Africa. The possible role and contribution of exposure of the general population in this area to chronic malnutrition as a result of prolonged famine, drought and war, to the high prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus warrants further study.

AB  - The November 2018 Camp Fire, a devastating wildfire in Northern California, occurred during the peak of breeding season for field monkeys at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC). Effects of environmental stressors, such as wildfires, on birth outcomes in primates, and in humans, are poorly understood. Additionally, wildfires are of growing concern due to their increasing frequency and severity. The objective was to examine the impact of wildfire smoke on fertility, timing of birth, and pregnancy loss for field monkeys. A unique case-control study to investigate birth outcomes in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) was conducted at the CNPRC. All females in the study were maintained in outdoor fields during a period of elevated ambient wildfire smoke from November 8-22, 2018. In addition to ambient air quality evaluations, the effects on fertility, timing to birth, and pregnancy loss were documented. Archival records of approximately 5,000 conceptions from the previous nine years served as control data. During the Camp Fire, ambient fine particulate (PM 2.5) levels exceeded the 24 -h National Ambient Air Quality Standard (35 mu g/m 3) of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, reaching levels as high as 185 mu g/m 3. A statistically significant association was observed between birth loss and the 2018-2019 CNPRC breeding season. As this wildfire event occurred during various stages of early pregnancy, an association can be inferred between early gestational exposure and increased risk of pregnancy loss.

AB  - The review examines how climate change adversely affects maternal health and pregnancy outcomes in Africa, a region particularly vulnerable to climate-related disasters. It highlights the increased incidence of tropical and waterborne illnesses due to climate change, disproportionately impacting expectant mothers. The study thoroughly evaluates the effects of extreme weather events like heatwaves and floods on maternal health, both directly and indirectly. It underscores significant gaps in policy and research within African health sectors regarding these issues. Key findings reveal that maternal death rates remain alarmingly high, with risks like preterm birth, stillbirth, and maternal hypertension exacerbated by climate change. The review calls for urgent action, including enhanced research, increased funding for climate adaptation, and the integration of maternal health into broader climate resilience strategies. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for greater awareness and international collaboration to strengthen health systems in Africa, particularly addressing the vulnerabilities of pregnant women. This work aims to enhance understanding among policymakers and researchers about the critical health impacts of climate change on pregnant women in Africa.

AB  - This paper focuses on political decentralisation as an institutional determinant of the level and spatial distribution of infant mortality rates (IMR). At the national level, we show that political decentralisation is linked to lower IMR, but these benefits are concentrated in high-income decentralised nations. In developing nations, decentralisation is associated with significantly higher spatial variation in IMR. We explore the mechanisms driving these patterns by leveraging floods as plausibly exogenous events in our global sample and a detailed analysis of Brazil. In Brazil, floods increase municipal variation in IMR, with impacts disproportionately accruing in low-income municipalities with limited government services.

AB  - Background
   Ethiopia is a Sub-Saharan country with very high neonatal mortality rates, varying across its regions. The rate of neonatal mortality reduction in Ethiopia is slow, and Ethiopia may not meet the third United Nations sustainable development target by 2030. This study aimed to investigate the spatial variations and contributing factors for neonatal mortality rates in Ethiopia.
   Methods
   We analysed data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS), which used a two-stage cluster sampling technique with a census enumeration area as primary and households as secondary sampling units. A Bayesian spatial logistic regression model using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) method was fitted accounting for socio-economic, health service-related and geographic factors.
   Results
   Higher neonatal mortality rates were observed in eastern, northeastern and southeastern Ethiopia, and the Somali region had higher risks of neonatal mortality. Neonates from frequently drought-affected areas had a higher mortality risk than less drought-affected areas. Application of traditional substances on the cord increased the risk of neonatal mortality (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.07, 95% Credible Interval (CrI): 1.12 to 4.30) and getting health facility delivery services had a lower odds of neonatal mortality (AOR = 0.60, 95% CrI: 0.37, 0.98).
   Conclusions
   Residing in drought-affected areas, applying traditional substances on the umbilical cord and not delivering at health facilities were associated with a higher risk of neonatal mortality. Policy-makers and resource administrators at different administrative levels could leverage the findings to prioritise and target areas identified with higher neonatal mortality rates.

AB  - Extreme climate events can have important consequences for the dynamics of natural populations, and severe droughts are predicted to become more common and intense due to climate change. We analysed infant mortality in relation to drought in two primate species (white-faced capuchins, Cebus capucinus imitator, and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi) in a tropical dry forest in northwestern Costa Rica. Our survival analyses combine several rare and valuable long-term datasets, including long-term primate life-history, landscape-scale fruit abundance, food-tree mortality, and climate conditions. Infant capuchins showed a threshold mortality response to drought, with exceptionally high mortality during a period of intense drought, but not during periods of moderate water shortage. By contrast, spider monkey females stopped reproducing during severe drought, and the mortality of infant spider monkeys peaked later during a period of low fruit abundance and high food-tree mortality linked to the drought. These divergent patterns implicate differing physiology, behaviour or associated factors in shaping species-specific drought responses. Our findings link predictions about the Earth's changing climate to environmental influences on primate mortality risk and thereby improve our understanding of how the increasing severity and frequency of droughts will affect the dynamics and conservation of wild primates.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of exposure to weather events during gestation on birth weight and anthropometric health of a cohort of children. We explore birth records for the cohort of children born between 2003 and 2013 in Sierra Leone using Demographic Health Surveys linked to temporal variation of rainfall and temperature patterns. We find that in utero droughts (or abnormally low precipitation levels) increase the prevalence of low birth weight with larger effects among boys. However, the effects of those same in utero shocks on the prevalence of stunting up to 59 months later are smaller for boys than for girls. The gender difference in estimated impacts from birth to anthropometric health is attributed to food consumption patterns that favour boys. Our results have policy implications for tracking health outcomes during early childhood using birth and anthropometric health, especially by gender.

KW  - TRAUMA
AB  - Trauma is the leading cause of non-obstetric maternal mortality and contributes to around 20% cases of maternal deaths. The commonest cause of trauma during pregnancy is road traffic accidents. An 18-year-old G2 P1 L1 at 13 weeks of gestation living in a makeshift tent near a construction site came under a landslide. She remained buried under the rubbles until she could be excavated next day. Patient reached our facility almost 27 h after the incident. Primary survey revealed patent airway; however, she had tachypnea, tachycardia and hypotension, positive FAST examination, and fetus floating in fluid filled peritoneal cavity on USG abdomen. Patient was resuscitated and immediately taken for exploration, which revealed hemoperitoneum, uterine fundus perforation with decapitated fetus in the peritoneal cavity, two jejunal perforations, and tear in urinary bladder wall and anterior vaginal wall. Primary repair of jejunal and uterine perforations with suprapubic cystostomy (SPC) was followed by repair of the anterior vaginal wall at a later stage. Patient was discharged in healthy condition and is doing well on follow-up. Management of trauma in pregnancy is challenging due to physiological changes and involves concurrent resuscitation of two patients. The uterus remains an intra-pelvic organ until 12-14 weeks of gestation and is protected by the pelvic skeleton. The incidence of rupture of scarred uterus is between 0.3 and 1 % and that of unscarred uterus is 1 in 5700 to 1 in 20,000 pregnancies. Almost all of these ruptures occur in 3rd trimester near term. Traumatic uterine rupture is reported to have almost 100% fetal and 46% maternal mortality. Uterine trauma with fetal demise is more common in the late second and third trimester and placental abruption being leading cause of fetal death in such cases. Traumatic uterine rupture in first trimester is extremely rare. Traumatic uterine rupture with fetal decapitation in early pregnancy has not been reported to best of our knowledge.

AB  - Background Pacific Island countries are vulnerable to disasters, including cyclones and earthquakes. Disaster preparedness is key to a well-coordinated response to preventing sexual violence and assisting survivors, reducing the transmission of HIV and other STIs, and preventing excess maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. This study aimed to identify the capacity development activities undertaken as part of the SPRINT program in Fiji and Tonga and how these enabled the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) response to Tropical Cyclones Winston and Gita. Methods This descriptive qualitative study was informed by a framework designed to assess public health emergency response capacity across various levels (systems, organisational, and individual) and two phases of the disaster management cycle (preparedness and response). Eight key informants were recruited purposively to include diverse individuals from relevant organisations and interviewed by telephone, Zoom, Skype and email. Template analysis was used to examine the data. Findings Differences in the country contexts were highlighted. The existing program of training in Tonga, investment from the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) Humanitarian Hub, the status of the Tonga Family Health Association as the key player in the delivery of SRH, together with its long experience of delivering contract work in short time-frames and strong relationship with the Ministry of Health (MoH) facilitated a relatively smooth and rapid response. In contrast, there had been limited capacity development work in Fiji prior to Winston, requiring training to be rapidly delivered during the immediate response to the cyclone with the support of surge staff from IPPF. In Fiji, the response was initially hampered by a lack of clarity concerning stakeholder roles and coordination, but linkages were quickly built to enable a response. Participants highlighted the importance of personal relationships, individuals' and organisations' motivation to respond, and strong rapport with the community to deliver SRH. Discussion This study highlights the need for comprehensive activities at multiple levels within a country and across the Pacific region to build capacity for a SRH response. While the SPRINT initiative has been implemented across several regions to improve organisational and national capacity preparedness, training for communities can be strengthened. This research outlines the importance of formalising partnerships and regular meetings and training to ensure the currency of coordination efforts in readiness for activation. However, work is needed to further institutionalise SRH in emergencies in national policy and accountability mechanisms.
   Plain Language Summary Pacific Island countries experience many disasters, including cyclones and earthquakes. The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) has been working in the Pacific to help build skills to improve the response to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and rights during disasters. This paper describes research to identify capacity building activities that helped prepare organisations in Fiji and Tonga and how this affected the delivery of SRH during Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016, and Tropical Cyclone Gita in 2018. Key informants in senior positions from relevant organisations were recruited and interviewed by telephone, Zoom, Skype and email. We used a framework that described different levels of capacity across phases of the disaster management cycle to analyse the data. Eight key informants described differences in Fiji and Tonga's preparedness activities before Tropical Cyclones Winston and Gita that affected the way in which services were delivered. The Tonga Family Health Association was well established as a key player in SRH service delivery before Gita and had built relationships and delivered training for disaster response to staff across a number of organisations including the Ministry of Health (MoH). These preparedness efforts facilitated a smooth and rapid response. In Fiji, the response was initially affected by a lack of training, role clarity and coordination, but linkages were quickly built to deliver care and services. Participants highlighted the importance of personal relationships, individuals' and organisations' motivation to respond, and strong links with the community to deliver SRH care. This study highlights the need for inclusive activities at individual, organisational and national levels within countries and across the Pacific region to build capacity for a SRH response.

AB  - Objectives: Tangshan earthquake which had a magnitude of 7.8 killed approximately 250,000 people in China in 1976. In the present study, we sought to determine the prevalence and risks of mental disorders in adults who experienced earthquake as an infant or in the prenatal period.
   Methods: This cross-sectional cohort study recruited participants based on the urban resident registry of Tangshan, Hebei province, 2013 using a multistage stratified cluster sampling method with selection probabilities proportional to size. We recruited subjects who were born between July 29, 1975 and April 28, 1978 that was one year before and 1.9 years after the occurrence of Tangshan Earthquake, respectively. Current psychiatric diagnoses and lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were obtained through the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders Patient Research Version. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze risk factors of mental disorders.
   Results: Totally1380 subjects were included with 392 subjects exposed to the earthquake in the fetal period, 399 subjects who experienced the earthquake during their infancy, and 589 subjects who had no exposure to the earthquake. Twenty-one (2.7%; current 1.9%) subjects exposed to earthquake were diagnosed with major depressive disorderversus 2.3% (current 1.5%) in the non-exposure group. Five (0.6%; current 0.6%) subjects with exposure to earthquake had bipolar disorder versus 0.9% in the non-exposure group. Thirteen (1.6%; current 1.6%) subjects with exposure to earthquake had schizophreniaversus 0.2% in the non-exposure group (P = 0.006). Furthermore, 5.2% (current 3.7%) subjects with exposure to earthquake had anxiety disorders versus 5.7% (current 3.9%) in the non-exposure group. Moreover, 8.1% (current 7.0%)subjects with exposure to earthquake had alcohol use disorders versus 7.1% (current 5.3%) in the non-exposure group. Furthermore, the prevalence of schizophrenia of the prenatal exposure group (2.3%) was significantly higher than the other two groups (chi(2) = 10.273, P = 0.006); however, no statistically significant difference was found in the current and lifetime prevalence of other DSM-IV axis I disorders among the three groups (P > 0.05). Our multivariate regression analysis showed that prenatal earthquake stress exposure was not a significant risk of any of the lifetime or current DSD-IV axis I disorders.
   Conclusion: Adults who were exposed to earthquake in the prenatal period had a significantly higher rate of schizophrenia than those who were not exposed or who experienced earthquake in their infancy. No statistically significant difference was found in the current and lifetime prevalence of other DSM-IV axis I disorders between those exposed and those not exposed to earthquake. Furthermore, prenatal earthquake stress exposure was not a significant risk of any of the lifetime or current DSD-IV axis I disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that earthquake severely threatens life-safety and physical damage. However, the empirical literature on the effects of nature disasters such as earthquake on the reproductive outcomes is limited. METHODS: On May 12th, 2008, a massive 8.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in Wenchuan, a city 92 km away from our animal facility [National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs (NCCSED)]. To investigate whether this tremendous earthquake exerted adverse effects on the reproductive and developmental functions in Sprague-Dawley rats, we collected some relevant data from reproductive toxicity studies around the earthquake, and compared them with the background data, which were gathered before and after the earthquake. Copulation ratio, gestation ratio, and fertility of female rats, as well as uterine and fetal morphology, were examined. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that the Wenchuan earthquake significantly decreased the copulation and gestation ratio, although it did not exhibit obvious side effects on some other reproductive and developmental parameters.

AB  - Effective strategies to reduce indoor air pollutant concentrations during wildfire smoke events are critically needed. Worldwide, communities in areas prone to wildfires may suffer from annual smoke exposure events lasting from days to weeks. In addition, there are many areas of the world where high pollution events are common and where methods employed to reduce exposure to pollution may have relevance to wildfire smoke pollution episodes and vice versa. This article summarizes a recent virtual meeting held by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to share research, experiences, and other information that can inform best practices for creating clean air spaces during wildland fire smoke events. The meeting included presentations on the public health impacts of wildland fire smoke; public health agencies' experiences and resilience efforts; and methods to improve indoor air quality, including the effectiveness of air filtration methods [e.g., building heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and portable, free-standing air filtration systems]. These presentations and related research indicate that filtration has been demonstrated to effectively improve indoor air quality during high ambient air pollution events; however, several research questions remain regarding the longevity and maintenance of filtration equipment during and after smoke events, effects on the pollution mixture, and degree to which adverse health effects are reduced.

AB  - Objective This study continues former studies on perinatal mortality in Japan after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (FDNPP) accident in March 2011. An increased study region is chosen, and the study period is extended to 2019.
   Methods Japanese monthly perinatal mortality data are provided on a prefecture level by the Japanese government. The study region consists of 12 prefectures around the FDNPP; the rest of Japan is used as the control region. A combined non-linear regression of perinatal mortality rates in the study- and control regions is conducted. The regression model allows for a common asymptotic lower limit of perinatal mortality, seasonal variations, and periodic peaks in 2012-2019 in the study region. To determine the dependency of the effect on distance from the FDNPP, the study region is divided into four core prefectures and eight prefectures surrounding the core prefectures.
   Results Perinatal mortality rates in the study region show a significant 6.4% (95% CI: 1.8%, 13.4%) overall increase in 2012-2019 relative to the trend in preceding years with no attenuation during 2012-19. The increase translates to 590 (165, 1226) excess perinatal deaths (p = 0.016). It is characterized by annual peaks with maxima in April. A 13.6% increase is determined in the four core prefectures and a 4.3% increase in eight prefectures surrounding the core prefectures. Before 2012, there is a peak around April 2011 and a decline in October 2011; another significant peak is detected in November 2012. In the 4 core prefectures, large increases are found in the first quarter of 2018 (+70%) and in May 2019 (+130%).
   Conclusion This study finds periodic peaks in perinatal mortality in spring 2012-2019 in 12 prefectures of Japan surrounding the FDNPP. In light of massive increases in 2018 and 2019 in the four core prefectures, continued investigation of perinatal mortality in contaminated regions of Japan is recommended.

AB  - Objective: Previous reports suggest that maternal exposure to acute stress related to earthquakes affects the sex ratio at birth. Our aim was to examine the change in sex ratio at birth after Eastern Marmara earthquake disasters.
   Material and Methods: This study was performed using the official birth statistics from January 1997 to December 2002 - before and after 17 August 1999, the date of the Golcuk Earthquake - supplied from the Turkey Statistics Institute. The secondary sex ratio was expressed as the male proportion at birth, and the ratio of both affected and unaffected areas were calculated and compared on a monthly basis using data from gender with using the Chi-square test.
   Results: We observed significant decreases in the secondary sex ratio in the 4th and 8th months following an earthquake in the affected region compared to the unaffected region (p= 0.001 and p= 0.024). In the earthquake region, the decrease observed in the secondary sex ratio during the 8th month after an earthquake was specific to the period after the earthquake.
   Conclusion: Our study indicated a significant reduction in the secondary sex ratio after an earthquake. With these findings, events that cause sudden intense stress such as earthquakes can have an effect on the sex ratio at birth.

AB  - We study hurricane risk on the U.S. Gulf Coast during 1950-2005, estimating the wind damage and storm surge from every hurricane in this extended period. Wind damage is estimated from the known path and wind speeds of individual storms and calibrated to fit actual damage reports for a sample of Gulf Coast storms. Storm surge is estimated using the SLOSH model developed by NOAA. These models provide the first comprehensive overview of the hurricane storm hazard as it has been experienced over a fifty-six-year period. We link the estimated damage with information on the population and specific socio-demographic components of the population (by age, race, and poverty status). Results show that white, young adult, and nonpoor populations have shifted over time away from zones with higher risk of wind damage, while more vulnerable population groups-the elderly, African Americans, and poorhave moved in the opposite direction. All groups have moved away from areas with high risk of storm surge since 1970. But in this case, perhaps because living near the water is still perceived as an amenity, those at highest risk are whites, elderly, and nonpoor households. Here exposure represents a trade-off between the risk and the amenity.

AB  - A natural experiment is employed to analyze the relationship between living standards, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Results show that shocks generated by two powerful tropical storms striking Puerto Rico during the late 1920s and early 1930s had long-term consequences consistent with the fetal origins hypothesis. Individuals in the womb or early infancy in the aftermath of the storms are more likely to report a diagnosis of hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and are considerably more likely to have no formal schooling.

AB  - Exposure to air pollution, including criteria pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3), has been associated with morbidity and mortality in mammals. As a genetically homogenous population that is closely monitored for health, dairy cattle present a unique opportunity to assess the association between changes in air pollution and mammalian health. Milk yield decreases in the summer if temperature and humidity, measured by the Temperature Humidity Index (THI). As O-3 levels increase with warmer temperatures, and summer PM2.5 may increase with wildfire smoke, dairy cows may serve as a useful sentinel species to evaluate subacute markers of inflammation and metabolic output and ambient pollution. Over two years, we assessed summertime O-3 and PM2.5 concentrations from local US EPA air quality monitors into an auto-regressive mixed model of the association between THI and daily milk production data and bulk tank somatic cell count (SCC). In unadjusted models, a 10 unit increase THI was associated with 28,700 cells/mL (95% CI: 17,700, 39,690) in-crease in SCC. After controlling for ambient air pollutants, THI was associated with a 14,500 SCC increase (95% CI: 3,400, 25,680), a 48% decrease in effect compared to the crude model. Further, in fully adjusted models, PM2.5 was associated with a 105,500 cells/mL (95% CI: 90,030, 121,050) increase in SCC. Similar results were found for milk production. Results were amplified when high PM2.5 days (95th percentile of observed values) associated with wildfire smoke were removed from the analyses. Our results support the hypothesis that PM2.5 confounds the relationships between THI and milk yield and somatic cell count. The results of this study can be used to inform strategies for intervention to mitigate these impacts at the dairy level and potentially contribute to a model where production animals can act as air quality sentinels.

AB  - We examined methodological issues in studies of disaster-related effects on reproductive health outcomes and fertility among women of reproductive age and infants in the United States (US). We conducted a systematic literature review of 1,635 articles and reports published in peer-reviewed journals or by the government from January 1981 through December 2010. We classified the studies using three exposure types: (1) physical exposure to toxicants; (2) psychological trauma; and (3) general exposure to disaster. Fifteen articles met our inclusion criteria concerning research focus and design. Overall studies pertained to eight different disasters, with most (n = 6) focused on the World Trade Center attack. Only one study examined pregnancy loss, i.e., occurrence of spontaneous abortions post-disaster. Most studies focused on associations between disaster and adverse birth outcomes, but two studies pertained only to post-disaster fertility while another two examined it in addition to adverse birth outcomes. In most studies disaster-affected populations were assumed to have experienced psychological trauma, but exposure to trauma was measured in only four studies. Furthermore, effects of both physical exposure to toxicants and psychological trauma on disaster-affected populations were examined in only one study. Effects on birth outcomes were not consistently demonstrated, and study methodologies varied widely. Even so, these studies suggest an association between disasters and reproductive health and highlight the need for further studies to clarify associations. We postulate that post-disaster surveillance among pregnant women could improve our understanding of effects of disaster on the reproductive health of US pregnant women.

AB  - To clarify the relationship between preterm birth (PTB) and extreme weather events, we evaluated PTB during a January 1998 ice storm that had led to a provincial emergency in the middle of winter in the province of Qu,bec, Canada. Singleton live births for three periods (1993-1997, 1998, 1999-2003) were obtained (N = 855,320). PTB was defined as gestational age < 37 completed weeks. Births in the Triangle of Darkness, the area most strongly affect by the storm, were geocoded. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate the likelihood of PTB for the Triangle relative to metropolitan Montr,al, adjusting for maternal age, education, civil status, maternal birthplace, and previous deliveries. Associations for 1998 relative to other periods were evaluated. Short-term (January-February) and long-term (March-October) exposure periods were examined. The proportion PTB for 1998 January-February births in the Triangle (8.7%) was high compared with 1998 March-October births (6.0%) and with the corresponding proportions for 1993-1997 (6.2%) and 1999-2003 (6.9%). Covariate-adjusted odds of PTB for January-February 1998 were 27% higher for the Triangle relative to metropolitan Montr,al, though precision was low. Furthermore, adjusted odds were 28% higher for 1998 relative to 1999-2003, despite increasing rates of PTB over time. Odds were not elevated over a long-term exposure period. This study suggests a weak association between PTB and exposure to extreme weather for the two months following an ice storm, but not for later periods after the storm.

AB  - The multiple nuclear meltdowns at the Fukushima plants beginning on March 11, 2011, are releasing large amounts of airborne radioactivity that has spread throughout Japan and to other nations; thus, studies of contamination and health hazards are merited. In the United States, Fukushima fallout arrived just six days after the earthquake, tsunami, and meltdowns. Some samples of radioactivity in precipitation, air, water, and milk, taken by the U.S. government, showed levels hundreds of times above normal; however, the small number of samples prohibits any credible analysis of temporal trends and spatial comparisons. U.S. health officials report weekly deaths by age in 122 cities, about 25 to 35 percent of the national total. Deaths rose 4.46 percent from 2010 to 2011 in the 14 weeks after the arrival of Japanese fallout, compared with a 2.34 percent increase in the prior 14 weeks. The number of infant deaths after Fukushima rose 1.80 percent, compared with a previous 8.37 percent decrease. Projecting these figures for the entire United States yields 13,983 total deaths and 822 infant deaths in excess of the expected. These preliminary data need to be followed up, especially in the light of similar preliminary U.S. mortality findings for the four months after Chernobyl fallout arrived in 1986, which approximated final figures.

AB  - We study whether exposure to earthquake affects health at birth. A mother-fixed-effect model together with the spatiotemporal variation of earthquakes in Chile allow us to better estimate the impacts on birth outcomes. Our findings show that exposure to earthquakes affects fetal growth. Infants born to mothers exposed to earthquakes in the second trimester are 1.8% more likely to be large for gestational age (LGA), which is a large effect from a baseline of 7% of LGA newborns. The reported impact varies across mothers' socioeconomic status, with relatively poorer Chilean mothers being more vulnerable to earthquakes. A possible mechanism that explains these results could work through changes in the incidence of women with diabetes. We provide indirect evidence in this regard. Mothers with diabetes are more likely to have large-for-gestational-age babies. Exposure to earthquakes increases the incidence of diabetes among the affected population, with the observed impact on diabetes being relatively higher among women of lower socioeconomic status.

AB  - Extreme climate events have increased the frequency and intensity of environmental extremes, impacting children, particularly infants. To systematically investigate how infant mortality is temporally related to extreme climate events, we created a mathematical model to demonstrate the transitory nature of the relationships in India over the period 1990-2022, using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method as an econometric approach with time series mathematical modeling. This method enables to estimate variables dynamic relationships in both the long and short run, and is ideal for addressing the complexity of extreme climatic event interactions. The empirical findings indicate that particulate matter (PM2.5), and increased frequency of natural disaster events have a significant positive relationship with higher infant mortality rates in both long and shortrun, as 1 % rise in disasters and PM2.5 levels results in 0.05 % and 0.12 % rise in infant mortality rates respectively in the long run. The increased occurrence of vector-borne diseases has revealed mixed results as rise in malaria by 1 % leads to rise in infant mortality rates by 0.21 % in the long-run, while dengue has a negative association in the long-run. The rise in temperature and carbon emissions demonstrated a negative link with the infant mortality rate in both long and short-run. This study highlights the need for climate-resilient health systems and the need for early warning systems to protect infant health amid increasing climate extremes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an earthquake experienced during pregnancy on maternal stress, depression, and perinatal outcomes.<br /> METHODS: This descriptive-comparative study was conducted between April and May 2023 in four state hospitals affiliated to the Ministry of Health with 82 mothers (affected bythe earthquake=41, not affected bythe earthquake=41) who gave birth. Data were obtained with the Personal Information Form, Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale, and Traumatic Stress Symptom Checklist.<br /> RESULTS: The mean age of the mothers who were earthquake affected in the study was 27.63 +/- 5.62. It was determined that earthquake-affected mothers gave birth prematurely and the birth weight of their infants was lower (p<0.05). Itwas determined that all of the earthquake-affected mothers experienced more stress accordingtothe Traumatic Stress Symptom Checklist scale cut-off score (>25) and 73.2% of them showed more depressive symptoms accordingtothe Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale cut-off score (>13) (p<0.05). Accordingto multivariate regression analysis, early gestational age and depressive symptoms were found to be risk factors for posttraumatic stress in mothers affected bythe earthquake (p<0.05).<br /> CONCLUSION: The study concluded that the earthquake-affected mothers showed depressive symptoms at least 6 weeks after giving birth, and all had increased levels of posttraumatic stress.

AB  - Aim: The aim was to evaluate the trends in childhood mortality in Finland from 1969 to 2004. We especially wanted to find out whether the decline in mortality is continuous and whether there are still deaths that could be prevented.
   Methods: We analyzed mortality data obtained from the official cause of death statistics in Finland from 1969 to 2004. Annual mortality rates were calculated in proportion to those at risk of dying. Comparison of cause specific mortality rates was conducted for neonatal group and children aged 1 month to 15 years.
   Results: Annual neonatal mortality declined from 11.13 parts per thousand in 1969 to 2.46 parts per thousand in 2004. The leading causes of death were perinatal disorders and congenital malformations. Mortality among children aged 1 month to 15 years declined from 0.67 parts per thousand in 1969 to 0.23 parts per thousand in 2004, with accidents the leading cause of death, although congenital malformations, tumours and haematological diseases, and infectious diseases were significant causes as well. There was a notable peak in total mortality in 2004, as 44 Finnish children died in the Asian tsunami in December of that year.
   Conclusion: Childhood mortality in Finland has decreased significantly during recent decades. Prevention programmes should be directed towards reducing mortality from accidents by promoting traffic safety and ensuring a safer environment. Even though child mortality is very low in Finland at present, continued reductions can still be achieved.

AB  - Storms are one of the most frequent natural hazards and are expected to become more extreme as climate change proceeds. This paper investigates storms classified as disasters and infant mortality in the Philippines. Data from the Philippine Demographic and Health Surveys from 2003, 2008, and 2017 are combined with data on storms from the Emergency Events Database (EM -DAT) and the Geocoded Disasters Dataset. Storms included in EM-DAT are disasters with human and economic impact on the population. The lagged and immediate impact of storms are considered by including disasters occurring from five years prior to birth to two months after birth. The data are analysed with linear probability models and mother fixed-effects. The results show limited or no association between storms and infant mortality, which reflects a positive overall development in the Philippines over recent years. Improvements in disaster management systems are likely to have made communities and households more resilient.

AB  - Introduction: Unexpected disasters, such as earthquakes or fires, require preparation to address knowledge gaps that may negatively affect vulnerable patients. Training programs can promote natural disaster readiness to respond and evacuate patients safely, but also require evidence-based information to guide learning objectives.
   Problem: There is limited evidence on what skills and bedside equipment are most important to include in disaster training and evacuation programs for critically ill infants.
   Methods: An expert panel was used to create a 13-item mastery checklist of skills for bedside registered nurses (RNs) required to successfully evacuate a critically ill infant. Expert nurses were surveyed, and the Angoff method was used to determine which of the mastery checklist skills a newly graduated nurse (ie, the "minimally competent" nurse) should be able to do. Participants then rated the importance of 26 commonly available pieces of bedside equipment for use in evacuating a hemodynamically unstable, intubated infant during a disaster.
   Results: Twenty-three emergency department (ED) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) charge RNs responded to the survey with a mean of 19 (SD = 9) years of experience and 30% reporting personal experience with evacuating patients. The skills list scores showed an emphasis on the newly graduated nurse having more complete mastery of skills surrounding thermoregulation, documentation, infection control, respiratory support, and monitoring. Skills for communication, decision making, and anticipating future needs were assessed as less likely for a new nurse to have mastered. On a scale of one (not important) to seven (critically important), the perceived necessity of equipment ranged from a low of 1.6 (breast pump) to a high of 6.9 (face mask). The individual intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.55 showed moderate reliability between raters and the average team ICC of 0.97 showed excellent agreement as a group.
   Conclusion: Experts rated the ability to manage physiological issues, such as thermoregulation and respiratory support, as skills that every nurse should master. Disaster preparedness activities for nurses in training may benefit from checklists of essential equipment and skills to ensure all nurses can independently manage patients' physiologic needs when they enter the workforce. Advanced nursing training should include education on decision making, communication during emergencies, and anticipation of future issues to ensure that charge and resource nurses can support bedside nurses during evacuation events.

AB  - Climate change's impact on global food security is a pressing concern with profound consequences. Climate change disrupts the global food system through a number of mechanisms including extreme weather events, rising food prices, and compromised food quality. In this article, we explore the effect of climate change on food security and the resulting health impacts of poor nutrition on pregnant women and infants in the perinatal period. Inadequate nutrition during pregnancy raises the risk of vitamin deficiencies, obstetric complications, maternal mortality, and infant malnutrition. Climate change exacerbates these challenges and perpetuates intergenerational cycles of poor nutrition. Addressing these issues requires traditional approaches to combating the climate impacts on general food security as well as specific approaches to bridge the food security gender gap. Empowering women as key stakeholders is crucial for overcoming the complex barriers to food insecurity caused by climate change, as well as protecting the well-being of vulnerable populations during the perinatal period.

AB  - Background Nurses working in intensive care units (ICUs) engage in an intense and demanding struggle to ensure the survival of newborns, who are among the most vulnerable populations during disasters. It is known that physical, logistical and technical resources are heavily utilised in the treatment and care processes within ICUs. However, our knowledge of how these resources are managed during and after disasters remains limited. Aim The aim of this study was to explore the experiences, challenges and decision-making mechanisms of nurses working in neonatal ICUs (NICUs) during an earthquake. Study Design This study employed a qualitative exploratory research design with a phenomenological approach. In-depth individual interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide between January and April 2025. A total of 18 nurses who worked in the NICUs of two different hospitals during and after the 2023 Kahramanmara & scedil; earthquakes in Turkey were included in the study using criterion sampling. Data were analysed using inductive content analysis methods. The Max Qualitative Data Analysis (2020) software was used for data coding. Results As a result of the data analysis, three main themes and 13 sub-themes were identified. The themes were as follows: 'Emergency Response and Implementation Challenges', 'Strategies Developed for the Safety of Newborns' and 'Psychological and Emotional Burdens of Nurses'. In addition, the topics 'Insufficiency in Material Supply', 'Problems Arising from Inadequate Staffing' and 'Experience of Loss and Grief' were found to be mentioned more frequently than other codes. Conclusions The findings showed that nurses faced challenges stemming from multiple professional, organisational, environmental and educational factors during the early phase of the disaster. Participants' perspectives revealed a strong relationship between professional competence in first response, disaster preparedness, traumatic burden and burnout. Relevance to Clinical Practice Identifying the challenges experienced by vulnerable populations during disasters, integrating these groups into disaster management plans, developing guidelines, promoting professional knowledge exchange and regularly conducting hands-on disaster training are of great importance.

AB  - Background. Maternal underweight and anemia are highly prevalent in Bihar, especially among adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 years. Although numerous programs and platforms exist for delivering efficacious interventions for improving maternal nutrition, the coverage and quality of these interventions are low.
   Objective. To examine existing interventions for reducing maternal undernutrition in Bihar and identify barriers to and opportunities for expanding their coverage and quality.
   Methods. The research was conducted in New Delhi and Bihar between May and August 2010. Forty-eight key informant interviews were conducted with policy makers, program managers, and service providers at multiple levels. Secondary data were collected from survey reports and program documents. All data were analyzed thematically.
   Results. Barriers to the delivery and uptake of interventions to improve maternal nutrition include the shortage of essential inputs, low prioritization of maternal undernutrition, sterilization bias within the family planning program, weak management systems, poverty, gender inequality, caste discrimination, and flooding. In order to overcome barriers and improve service delivery, the current government and its partners have introduced structural reforms within the public health system, launched new programs for underserved groups, developed innovative approaches, and experimented with new technologies.
   Conclusions. Since coming to power, the Government of Bihar has achieved impressive increases in the coverage of prioritized health services, such as institutional deliveries and immunization. This success presents it with an excellent opportunity to further reduce maternal and infant mortality by turning its attention to the serious problem of maternal undernutrition and low birthweight.

AB  - Objectives To identify and measure the place-specific determinants that are associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in the southern region of Mozambique.
   Design Retrospective cohort study. Choice of variables informed by literature and Delphi consensus.
   Setting Study conducted during the baseline phase of a community level intervention for pre-eclampsia that was led by community health workers.
   Participants A household census identified 50 493 households that were home to 80 483 women of reproductive age (age 12-49 years). Of these women, 14 617 had been pregnant in the 12 months prior to the census, of which 9172 (61.6%) had completed their pregnancies.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures A combined fetal, maternal and neonatal outcome was calculated for all women with completed pregnancies. Results A total of six variables were statistically significant (p=0.05) in explaining the combined outcome. These included: geographic isolation, flood proneness, access to an improved latrine, average age of reproductive age woman, family support and fertility rates. The performance of the ordinary least squares model was an adjusted R-2=0.69. Three of the variables (isolation, latrine score and family support) showed significant geographic variability in their effect on rates of adverse outcome. Accounting for this modest non-stationary effect through geographically weighted regression increased the adjusted R-2 to 0.71.
   Conclusions The community exploration was successful in identifying context-specific determinants of maternal health. The results highlight the need for designing targeted interventions that address the place-specific social determinants of maternal health in the study area. The geographic process of identifying and measuring these determinants, therefore, has implications for multisectoral collaboration.

AB  - Aim To describe how recipients of portable sleeping spaces (PSSs) for babies received and used these devices, offered as emergency baby beds in earthquake-ravaged Christchurch, New Zealand, 2011. Method The PSS package responded to increased risk to babies from disrupted living and sleeping conditions in families. Door-to-door' distribution offered easy access to those in need. A subgroup of recipients gave feedback via a survey. Results From 642 families who received PSSs between March and August, 139 were invited to complete a survey on usage and 100 (72%) responded. Risks identified were earthquake related' (82%), bed-sharing (41%), smoking in pregnancy (26%) and prematurity or low birthweight (11%). PSSs were used for same-bed co-sleeping by 87%. They were used even though most families (96%) also had a cot or bassinet. Features most appreciated were having baby close' (90%), peace of mind' (88%) and portability (74%). Conclusion PSSs were acceptable to parents and used as instructed. Enabling physical protection of babies when same-bed co-sleeping, they gave peace of mind to parents. PSSs could be considered in ordinary times for protecting babies from sudden infant death.

FX  - Many people from across New Zealand gave their support to this project in a variety of ways. Its success is shared with those who supplied goods and services at subsidised or no cost, organised sewing bees, sewed covers and sheet sets, assisted with the door to door blitz in the eastern suburbs, identified babies in need, promoted PSSs to families, delivered PSSs to homes, acted as distributing agencies to extend access and gave feedback along the way. Most importantly we acknowledge the more than 1000 families who used PSSs (called pepi-pods) in 2011 and their babies who slept safely in them. The project was partially funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Health.

AB  - Indonesia has been making good progress in reproductive health (RH) outcome. This study aimed to examine the effect of the September 2009 Sumatra earthquake on availability and accessibility of RH services and its possible impact on local Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Twenty-six health facilities in Padang City were reviewed and 667 clients directly interviewed. Water supply shortage was most widespread and slowest to recover, taking more than 1 year to normalize. Antenatal and emergency obstetric care was minimally disrupted, and family planning practice of the study couples was not changed by the earthquake. The previous rate of improvement in maternal and child mortality was slowed down, whereas stillbirths increased after the earthquake. Thus, there is a need to speed up the recovery to achieve the local MDGs.

AB  - We review the literature on the effects of Hurricane Katrina on perinatal health, and providing data from our own research on pregnant and postpartum women. After Katrina, obstetric, prenatal, and neonatal care was compromised in the short term, but increases in adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight, and maternal complications were mostly limited to highly exposed women. Both pregnant and postpartum women had rates of post-traumatic stress disorder similar to, or lower than, others exposed to Katrina, and rates of depression similar to other pregnant and postpartum populations. Health behaviors, such as smoking and breastfeeding, may have been somewhat negatively affected by the disaster, whereas effects on nutrition were likely associated with limited time, money, and food choices, and indicated by both weight gain and loss. We conclude that, with a few specific exceptions, postdisaster concerns and health outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women were similar to those of other people exposed to Hurricane Katrina. In such situations, disaster planners and researchers should focus on providing care and support for the normal concerns of the peripartum period, such as breastfeeding, depression, and smoking cessation. Contraception needs to be available for those who do not want to become pregnant. Although additional physical and mental health care needs to be provided for the most severely exposed women and their babies, many women are capable of surviving and thriving in postdisaster environments.

AB  - Floods, storms, and temperature extremes are examples of extreme weather events that have a substantial influence on a country's demographic dynamics, including migration, fertility, and mortality. Changes in population size, composition, and distribution may result from these occurrences. This study, which spans the years 1966-2018, looks at how Bangladesh's total fertility rate (TFR) is affected by extreme weather events and child mortality, including neonatal, infant, male infant, and under-five mortality. We use data from secondary publicly accessible sources, such as the World Bank and The Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), and we investigate the correlations using the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), complemented by bivariate and multivariable analyses. Our findings from the univariate analysis are noteworthy. Total extreme climate events ((3 = -0.345, 95 % CI: 0.510, -0.180), as well as individual extreme climate events, such as extreme temperatures ((3 = -1.176, 95 % CI: 1.88, -0.47), floods ((3 = - 0.644, 95 % CI: 1.0729, -0.216), and storms ((3 = -0.351, 95 % CI: 0.63159, -0.07154), exhibited negative associations with the TFR. Additionally, factors such as contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) ((3 = -0.085, 95 % CI: 0.09072, -0.07954) and gross national income (GNI) per capita ((3 = -0.003, 95 % CI: 0.0041123, -0.0024234) were negatively correlated with the TFR. Conversely, various categories of child mortality, namely, infants ((3 = 0.041, 95 % CI: 0.040474, 0.042748), males ((3 = 0.038, 95 % CI:0.037719, 0.039891), and under-five ((3 = 0.026, 95 % CI:0.025684, 0.026979) - are positively associated with TFR. Controlling for two pivotal confounding factors, time and GNI per capita, yielded consistent results in the multivariate analysis. These findings provide insight on the dual impact of extreme weather events, which can reduce TFR while also raising it through infant mortality. This phenomena may be due to the increased vulnerability of younger children in climate-event-prone areas, prompting parents to seek additional children as both a replacement for lost offspring and an insurance mechanism against future child loss.

AB  - BackgroundJapan's maternal mortality rate and perinatal mortality rate have shown one of the world's most significant declines, positioning Japan at the global forefront of the lowest levels. The nearly logarithmic annual decline in maternal and perinatal mortality rates suggests that, in addition to advances in medicine and healthcare, various types of care for mothers and newborns have played a crucial role in this achievement.MethodFrom the period of World War II to the postwar era, up to around 1980, and then every decade thereafter, the events and movements surrounding perinatal healthcare in each era were examined from the perspectives of epidemiology, medical/healthcare advancements, and institutional/policy trends.ResultsThe major events in each era are outlined as follows: Until around 1980: After World War II, in 1948, several laws were enacted to protect mothers and fetuses, including the Maternal and Child Health Handbook, in 1966. The number of births experienced a baby boom for about 10 years following 1945, peaking in 1973. Birthplaces shifted from home deliveries to medical facilities, with doctors becoming the primary birth attendants. Academically, the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (JAOG) for Maternal Protection and the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG) were established in 1949. In the medical field, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) were introduced and neonatal transport systems became well-established by the 1970s. In 1976, the limit of viability was revised from under 28 weeks of gestation to under 24 weeks. The late 1970s saw the fetal heart rate monitoring, the heartbeat detection using Doppler ultrasound and the ultrasound imaging techniques. 1980s: The perinatal medicine became well established, leading to hold The Japan Society of Perinatal Medicine. For fetal management, the fields of fetal diagnosis and fetal treatment entered their early stages with the widespread use of fetal heart rate monitoring and ultrasound imaging. In neonatal care, neonatal transport systems to NICU facilities were enhanced. A major breakthrough in this field was the discovery and widespread use of pulmonary surfactant. Two key concepts that emerged and advanced during this period were maternal transport systems and the Perinatal Maternal and Child Center initiative. In 1987, cases of hepatitis caused by non-heat-treated coagulation products became a major issue. As a result, informed consent affecting mothers and fetuses became a significant point of discussion. The Obstetrics and Gynecology Specialist system was introduced, along with the regular publication of Training Notes for Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Glossary of Obstetrics and Gynecology Terms. As a result of these efforts, both the perinatal mortality rate and the maternal mortality rate were reduced by approximately half over the course of 10 years. 1990s: In 1991, the limit of viability was revised to 22 weeks of gestation. In terms of maternal care, nutritional management guidelines for general pregnant women were introduced. In fetal medicine, major topics included the administration of steroids to the mother to promote fetal lung maturation, as well as direct fetal treatments such as shunt procedures and needle aspirations. In neonatal care, inhaled nitric oxide therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment became more widely adopted.
   Following the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, in 1995, led to the development of the Disaster Medical Assistance Team and the establishment of Perinatal Maternal and Child Medical Center. In 1996, the Maternal Protection Law was enacted, and the Japan Council for Quality Health Care (JCQHC) was founded to standardize medical care. Asia & Oceania Federation of Obstetrics & Gynecology Journal and Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology Research were launched as English-language academic journals. 2000s: Japan's perinatal mortality rate became the lowest in the world, but the maternal mortality rate was still struggling. Obstetric care changed significantly after an obstetrician was arrested for causing a maternal death during a cesarean section. The JSOG and the JAOG developed practice guidelines describing standard obstetric diagnosis and treatments, and the JCQHC established the Japan Obstetric Compensation System for Cerebral Palsy. In addition, a project to report on maternal deaths by JAOG was also launched, and the combination of these measures led to form a framework of professional autonomy for obstetricians. During this period, brain hypothermic therapy for brain injury was developed. 2010s: The Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 led to major changes in disaster medical planning. This included the introduction of training programs for disaster medical coordinators and the development of disaster-time pediatric and perinatal liaisons. To enhance medical safety, JAOG launched an incidental case reporting system in 2004. Additionally, in 2010, a maternal mortality reporting system was introduced, followed by the maternal severe complications reporting system in 2021. The Japan Council for Implementation of Maternal Emergency Life-Saving System was established, along with the Japan Association for Labor Analgesia, a collaborative council for academic societies and organizations related to painless delivery. Suicide as a significant cause of maternal death led to the establishment of the "Mother and Child Mental Forum" academic conference, which later evolved into the Mental Health Care for Mother & Child training program. In the field of prenatal testing, non-invasive prenatal testing was introduced as a clinical research initiative. From 2020 onward: The year 2020 began with the global outbreak of COVID-19. Until 2023, numerous issues arose due to repeated pandemics, including delivery methods and locations for COVID-positive pregnant women, standard precautions during labor, mother-infant separation after birth, vaccination, so on. JSOG and JAOG worked together to address these challenges. The most pressing issue in the perinatal field is the declining birth rate. Alongside an aging workforce of physicians and a shortage of successors, the decrease in new obstetric clinic openings has become a major concern. By 2024, the decrease in the number of full-time obstetricians and the overtime work limits in Medical Care Act are making it necessary to reconsider the structure of obstetric medical services. Japan's perinatal care system, which has maintained the highest global standards, now stands at a major crossroads.ConclusionResearchers (clinicians), academic societies, and professional organizations, centered on the mother and child, have collaborated with support from the government, making progress and building the current safe pregnancy and childbirth management system.
   However, significant issues remain that need urgent attention, including regulations on overtime work, securing obstetrician numbers, the rapid decline in childbirth facilities, and the functional collapse of perinatal maternal-child healthcare centers. These are critical challenges that must be addressed promptly.

AB  - Floods displace an average of 12 million people every year, and are responsible for 54% of all disaster-induced displacements. Displacement risk scales with the vulnerability of exposed populations, but this vulnerability is poorly understood at a global scale. Here we show that measures of human development and rural areas explain more of the variance of displacement vulnerability than income levels measured by gross domestic product. We combine global flood and displacement data to estimate vulnerability, as the ratio of displacement to exposure, for over 300 historical flood events. We find that this vulnerability varies by several orders of magnitude both between and within countries. A random forest regression shows that infant mortality rate and population density are among the most important predictors of displacement vulnerability at national level and within countries, respectively, highlighting the vulnerability of low-income and marginalized populations and of rural communities. Our results indicate that, rather than relying on overall economic development alone, targeted investments are needed to improve living conditions and coping capacities for the most vulnerable groups, particularly outside of large cities, and to prepare for increasing flood hazards due to climate change.

AB  - Climate change has increased the frequency of drought occurrence in various parts of the world. Drought as a complex phenomenon causes severe impacts on ecological and socio-economic status. Short-term and long-term occurrences of drought have made many regions vulnerable globally. This paper makes an attempt to assess drought vulnerability in Godavari Middle Sub-basin of India. Twenty-four site specific socio-economic and environmental factors were identified based on the extensive literature review. Drought frequency was assessed using standardized precipitation index (SPI). These datasets were divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) data. Frequency ratio (FR) model was utilized to establish relationship among drought conditioning factors and drought frequency. Weights obtained from the FR model were used as input to the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) model. Drought vulnerability results were validated using the testing data and receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The accuracy of ANFIS models for 1-month (0.957), 3-months (0.882), 6-months (0.964) and 12-months (0.938) showed high suitability of ANFIS model for the assessment of drought vulnerability. The findings revealed that very low normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and increasing trend of highest maximum and mean maximum temperature were major environmental factors which influenced high drought vulnerability in the sub-basin. High proportion of area under fallow land, high infant mortality rate (IMR) and moderate literacy rate were identified as major socio-economic factors making watersheds vulnerable during short and long-term droughts. Largest area of the sub-basin was found under high vulnerability for 3-months, followed by 6-months and 12-months droughts. Thus, the study calls for policy intervention towards lessening the impact of drought in highly vulnerable watersheds.

AB  - The inadvertent exposure of a large cohort of individuals to hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in the mid-1950s in southeastern Turkey remains an environmental disaster that continues to fascinate and provide interesting observations concerning this ubiquitous chemical. A brief history of the exposure is presented with particular reference to the initial presentation of Pembe Yara and Porphyria Cutanea Tarda and later to reproductive performance in humans and sub-human primates. Differential toxicity is present in the oocytes of monkeys, with more severe damage identified in primordial germ cells rather than in growing oocytes. However, this observation did not express itself in women, as there was no increased incidence of premature menopause among those exposed. Germ cell toxicity remains a possible outcome of exposure, however. The serum HCB levels measured in exposed individuals predicted the lifetime risk of spontaneous abortion, not only in exposed individuals but also in the control populations, indicating that a possible population effect is present.

AB  - Background: The Haiti earthquake in 2010 resulted in 1.5 million internally displaced people (IDP), yet little is known about the impact of displacement on health. In this study, we estimate the impact of displacement on infant and child mortality and key health-behavior mechanisms.
   Methods: We employ a difference-in-differences (DID) design with coarsened exact matching (CEM) to ensure comparability among groups with different displacement status using the 2012 Haiti Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The participants are 21,417 births reported by a nationally representative sample of 14,287 women aged 15-49. The main independent variables are household displacement status which includes households living in camps, IDP households (not in camps), and households not displaced. The main outcomes are infant and child mortality; health status (height-for-age, anemia); uptake of public health interventions (bed net use, spraying against mosquitoes, and vaccinations); and other conditions (hunger; cholera).
   Results: Births from the camp households have higher infant mortality (OR = 2.34, 95 % CI 1.15 to 4.75) and child mortality (OR = 2.34, 95 % CI 1.10 to 5.00) than those in non-camp IDP households following the earthquake. These odds are higher despite better access to food, water, bed net use, mosquito spraying, and vaccines among camp households.
   Conclusions: IDP populations are heterogeneous and households that are displaced outside of camps may be self-selected or self-insured. Meanwhile, even households not displaced by a disaster may face challenges in access to basic necessities and health services. Efforts are needed to identify vulnerable populations to provide targeted assistance in post-disaster relief.

AB  - The reproductive biology of the wild boas was analyzed during a period of drought in a Mediterranean area, Donana National Park (Spain), during 1993 and 1994. Births were highly synchronized, most of them occuring between February and April. The average litter size for litters of about 1 week of age was 3.05 piglets per birth. This figure is below most reported for other populations of the species which are mostly intrauterine litters, hence without the effect of perinatal mortality. The percentage of breeding adult females was below 17%, much smaller than that found for most Mediterranean areas. These results stress the breeding decision of females, rather than the timing of reproduction or the size of litters, as the main adjustment of reproductive effort in the wild boar under drought conditions, which may be common in fluctuating Mediterranean climates.

AB  - For the last few decades genome damage caused by exposure to ionizing radiation has been estimated with the use cytogenetical methods like chromosome aberration assay (CA), micronucleus assay (MN), or since recently fluorescent in situ hybridisation. However, all available studies on reliability of CA and MN to predict cancer risk are done on adult population while data concerning children are mostly related to those collected after the Chernobyl nuclear accident. After industrial nuclear accident exposures, several long-term follow-up studies have shown a higher level of genome damage and higher accumulation of radioisotopes in the skeleton of children than of adults. Similarly, rogue cells in a long-term follow-up study of exposure in industrial regions are more frequently detected in children than in adults. Additionally, is impossible to predict the transplacental impact of radioisotopes on miscarriage rate using CA in mothers. Due to its transmutation to He, tritium level in water may have a more severe impact on DNA integrity in the foetus than in adults, which results from higher mitotic rate during development. Recent studies in oncology patients using DNA microarrays identified a specific group of genes and SNPs whose expression is a signature of radiation response. These promising methods will enable researchers to detect age-related response to ionizing radiation and will give a better insight into individual cancer risk, as opposed to the group risk determined by CA and MN assays.

AB  - Water is turning to be scarce in Latin America and the Caribbean, in the 21st century, caused by an increase in its demand due to population growth, increased food production and higher energy consumption, linked to a temporary climate variation. Governments must establish water security programs by planning the management of water resources, as a paradigm shift. Mexico is not the exception, a country of strong meteorological, hydrographic and social contrasts throughout its territory, which impact in different ways the population strata, similar to other developing countries. In this context, hazard, social vulnerability and risk indexes are proposed and quantified in this paper, through a probabilistic methodology for calculating water security. Hazard is expressed by basic water services shortage, floods, groundwater depletion, and drought indicators. In turn, the vulnerability considers educational level of the population, access to health services, infant mortality rate, illiteracy, housing conditions, unemployment and proportion of indigenous language population. In the development of this study it is shown that both hazard and vulnerability throughout the Mexican territory are very heterogeneous. The proposed probabilistic methodology was implemented in a Geographical Information System obtaining water security indexes for all municipalities in Mexico (2,456 municipalities).

AB  - Rising emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have warmed the planet substantially and are also accompanied by poor air quality. The increased prevalence of allergic airway disease worldwide can be partially attributed to those global environmental changes. Climate change and air pollution pose adverse impacts on respiratory allergies, and that the mechanisms are complex and interactive. Adverse weather conditions, such as extreme temperatures, can act directly on the respiratory tract to induce allergic respiratory illnesses. Thunderstorms and floods can alter the production and distribution of aeroallergens while wildfires and dust storms increase air pollution, and therefore indirectly enhance health risks. Concentrations of particulate matter and ozone in the air have been projected to increase with climate warming and air stagnation, and the rising temperatures and CO(2)increase pollen, molds, and spores, which escalate the risk of allergic respiratory diseases. The synergistic effects of extreme heat and aeroallergens intensify the toxic effect of air pollutants, which in turn augment the allergenicity of aeroallergens. With the Earth's climate change, migration of humans and plants shift the living environments and allergens of susceptible people. Urban residents are exposed to multiple factors while children are sensitive to environmental exposure. Since climate change may pose many unexpected and persistent effects on allergic respiratory diseases, health professionals should advocate for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies to minimize its respiratory health effects.

AB  - The adverse impacts of climate change exert mounting pressure on agriculture-dependent livelihoods of many developing and developed nations. However, integrated and spatially specific vulnerability assessments in less-developed countries like Bangladesh are rare, and insufficient to support the decision-making needed for climate-change resilience. Here, we develop an agricultural livelihood vulnerability index (ALVI) and an integrated approach, allowing for (i) mapping out the hot spots of vulnerability distribution; (ii) identifying key factors of spatially heterogeneous vulnerability; and (iii) supporting intervention planning for adaptation. This study conceptualized vulnerability as a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity by developing a composite index from a reliable dataset of 64 indicators comprising biophysical, agro-ecological, and socioeconomic variables. The empirical studies of coastal Bangladesh revealed that Bhola, Patuakhali, and Lakshmipur districts, around the mouth of the deltaic Meghna estuaries, are the hot spot of vulnerability distribution. Furthermore, the spatially heterogeneous vulnerability was triggered by spatial variation of erosion, cyclones, drought, rain-fed agriculture, land degradation, soil phosphorus, crop productivity, sanitation and housing condition, infant mortality, emergency shelters, adoption of agro-technology. The integrated approach could be useful for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation intervention by substituting various hypothetical scenarios into the ALVI framework for baseline comparison.

AB  - Fatherhood is a turning point in the life of many men, but for fathers from fragile backgrounds, the birth of a premature child may be the catalyst for a fresh start. This case study details the experience of a young black man from a high-risk background during the pregnancy, birth, and hospitalization of his premature son. Fathers from backgrounds marked by violence and chaos may find the stability they crave in a hospital environment that provides comfort, familial cohesion, and an empowering sense of purpose. Fathers who lack male role models in their lives may benefit from mentoring relationships formed with male nurses in the neonatal intensive care unit. Longstanding neglected needs for available presence and guidance can be met by caring healthcare professionals who take the time to listen to these fathers and share personal experiences. While the struggle to break patterns of the past is complicated by low self-worth, healthcare providers can reinforce a sense of personal value both by providing a specific role for fathers and by engaging them in meaningful conversation. Findings provide valuable information on the lifeworld of black fathers from socially compromised urban neighborhoods and implications for healthcare practitioners working with this population.

AB  - Objective NICU patients are disproportionately affected by any disaster due to their vulnerability and highly specialized care needs that require a multitude of resources. Research in disaster preparedness and its effect on NICU patients is limited. Study design From March to May 2018, NICUs across California participated in a survey designed to assess their preparedness for a disaster. Results Of the 84 responding units, 99% were urban, 73% were nonprofit, and 65% were community NICUs. As for NICU participation in hospital training exercises for disaster preparedness, 10% did not participate in annual drills, 44% did once a year, 36% did twice a year, and 10% did more than two times per year. Conclusion We showed that many NICUs had redundant systems in place and plans for various disasters; however, there is not consistent participation by NICUs in hospital training exercises for disaster preparedness.

AB  - We examine the intergenerational transmission of mother-to-child health, using unique data tracking a cohort of Filipino children. We provide causal estimates of the impact of maternal health on child health and examine the persistence of this relationship from birth through adolescence. We find that mother's health continues to impact child health throughout childhood. Previous estimates gauging transmission at any single point during childhood therefore underestimate the full impact. The effect of mother's health on child height-for-age z-score is only partly explained by birthweight, socioeconomic mechanisms, or parental inputs-maternal health may additionally shape childhood growth trajectories until puberty.

AB  - Tropical peatland fires generate substantial quantities of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and in Indonesia are intensified during El Ni & ntilde;o-related drought leading to severe air quality impacts affecting local and distant populations. Limited in-situ data often necessitates reliance on air quality models, like that of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, whose accuracy in extreme conditions is not fully understood. Here we demonstrate how a network of low-cost sensors around Palangka Raya, Central Kalimantan during the 2019 fire season, quantified extreme air quality and city-scale variability. The data indicates relatively strong model performance. Health impacts are substantial with estimates of over 1200 excess deaths in the Palangka Raya region, over 3200 across Central Kalimantan and more than 87,000 nationwide in 2019 due to fire-induced PM2.5 exposure. These findings highlight the need for urgent action to mitigate extreme fire events, including reducing fire use and landscape remediation to prevent peat fire ignition.
   Networks of low-cost sensors can be used with atmospheric models to understand variability of air quality on a fine scale and show that emissions from peatland fires contribute to many excess deaths, suggests an analysis from the 2019 fire season in Kalimantan

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Can emergency vitrification protect embryos and oocytes during natural disasters or other events that prevent normal practice to achieve satisfactory embryonic development and clinical outcomes at a later time?SUMMARY ANSWER: Emergency vitrification of oocytes and Day 0-Day 5 (D0-D5) embryos during disasters is a safe and effective protective measure.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: When some destructive events such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other accidents occur, emergency vitrification in embryo laboratories to protect human embryos, oocytes, and sperm is one of the important measures of an IVF emergency plan. However, there are few detailed reports on emergency vitrification in a state of disaster, especially about oocytes and D0 zygotes. Therefore, the effectiveness and safety of emergency vitrification of oocytes and D0-D5 embryos in disaster states are still unclear.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective study was made in the Reproductive Medicine Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2018 to November 2022. The record rainstorms in Zhengzhou, China, caused severe flooding, traffic disruptions, and power outages. From 17:30, 20 July 2021 to 17:30, 21 July 2021, 1246 oocytes and D0-D5 embryos of 155 patients were vitrified whilst the laboratory had only an emergency power supply.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: As of 21 December 2021, 1149 emergency vitrified oocytes and D0-D5 embryos of 124 patients underwent frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET). They were divided into the following four groups according to the days of embryo culture in vitro: oocyte group, Day 0-Day 1 (D0-D1) group, Day 2-Day 3 (D2-D3) group, and Day 4-Day 5 (D4-D5) group. Control groups for each were selected from fresh cycle patients who underwent IVF/ICSI from January 2018 to October 2021. Control and emergency vitrification patients were matched on criteria that included age, fertilization method, days of embryonic development, and number and grade of transferred embryos. A total of 493 control patients were randomly selected from the eligible patients and matched with the emergency vitrification groups in a ratio of 4:1. The results of assisted reproduction and follow-up of pregnancy were analyzed. The embryonic development, clinical outcomes, and birth outcomes in each group were statistically analyzed.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A significant difference was observed in fertilization rate (81% versus 72%, P = 0.022) between the oocyte group and the control group. Significant differences were also observed in the monozygotic twin pregnancy rate (10% versus 0%, P = 0.038) and ectopic pregnancy rate (5% versus 0%, P = 0.039) between the D0-D1 group and the control group. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed between vitrified oocytes/D0-D1 embryos/D2-D3 embryos and the control group on the number of high-quality embryos (3.17 +/- 3.00 versus 3.84 +/- 3.01, P = 0.346; 5.04 +/- 3.66 versus 4.56 +/- 2.87, P = 0.346; 4.85 +/- 5.36 versus 5.04 +/- 4.64, P = 0.839), the number of usable blastocysts (1.22 +/- 1.78 versus 1.21 +/- 2.03, P = 0.981; 2.16 +/- 2.26 versus 1.55 +/- 2.08, P = 0.090; 2.82 +/- 3.23 versus 2.58 +/- 3.32, P = 0.706), clinical pregnancy rate (56% versus 57%, P = 0.915; 55% versus 55%, P = 1.000; 40% versus 50%, P = 0.488), miscarriage rate (30% versus 15%, P = 0.496; 5% versus 11%, P = 0.678; 17% versus 20%, P = 1.000), and live birth rate (39% versus 49%, P = 0.460; 53% versus 50%, P = 0.
   772; 33% versus 40%, P = 0.635). No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed between the D4-D5 group and the control group on clinical pregnancy rate (40% versus 55%, P = 0.645), miscarriage rate (0% versus 18%, P = 1.000), and live birth rate (40% versus 45%, P = 1.000)LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The retrospective study design is a limitation. The timing and extent of natural disasters are unpredictable, so the sample size of vitrified oocytes, zygotes, and embryos is beyond experimental control.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study is the first study analyzing embryonic development, clinical outcomes, and birth outcomes of large samples of oocytes, D0 zygotes, and D1-D5 embryos after emergency vitrification under the disaster conditions. The results show that emergency vitrification is a safe and effective protective measure applicable to oocytes and D0-D5 embryos. The embryology laboratories need to be equipped with an emergency uninterrupted power supply capable of delivering for 6-8 h at full load.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S:) This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 81871206).

AB  - Background: Age-specific pediatric health consequences of community disruption after Hurricane Katrina have not been analyzed. Post-Katrina vital statistics are unavailable. The objectives of this study were to validate an alternative method to estimate child mortality rates in the greater New Orleans area and compare pre-Katrina and post-Katrina mortality rates.
   Methods: Pre-Katrina 2004 child mortality was estimated from death reports in the local daily newspaper and validated by comparison with pre-Katrina data from the Louisiana Department of Health. Post-Katrina child mortality rates were analyzed as a measure of health consequences.
   Results: Newspaper-derived estimates of mortality rates appear to be valid except for possible underreporting of neonatal rates. Pre-Katrina and post-Katrina mortality rates were similar for all age groups except infants. Post-Katrina, a 92% decline in mortality rate occurred for neonates (<28 days), and a 57% decline in mortality rate occurred for postneonatal infants ( 28 days-1 year). The post-Katrina decline in infant mortality rate exceeds the pre-Katrina discrepancy between newspaper-derived and Department of Health-reported rates.
   Conclusions: A declining infant mortality rate raises questions about persistent displacement of high-risk infants out of the region. Otherwise, there is no evidence of long-lasting post-Katrina excess child mortality. Further investigation of demographic changes would be of interest to local decision makers and planners for recovery after public health emergencies in other regions.

AB  - Background Continuing health services after disasters and ensuring that pregnant women receive antenatal care are important to protect the health of mothers and babies.This study aims to investigates the experiences of pregnant women living in temporary shelters cities post-earthquake. Method A qualitative approach was employed to explore pregnant women experiences during the earthquake, that hit the Pazarc & imath;k district of central Kahramanmara & scedil;, Turkey, on February 6, 2023. Sixteen pregnant women participated to study who met the inclusion criteria. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview form and analyzed using MAXQDA qualitative software, following Colaizzi's seven-stage method. Results The age range of the pregnant women was 18-36. In line with the data obtained from interviews with these women, four main themes were identified: difficulties in meeting basic life needs (sub-themes of heating, clothing, food/nutrition, drinking water/sanitation/hygiene, and economic needs); difficulties in maintaining pregnancy and protecting health (sub-themes of changes in fetal movements, labor/bleeding, vomiting/weakness, and infection); (1) difficulty receiving antenatal care (sub-themes: inability to have antenatal follow-ups or tests, inability to listen to fetal heart sounds, lack of an ideal birth environment, fear of preterm birth, and lack of weight monitoring); (2) emotional difficulty (sub-themes: fear of preterm birth or not finding an ideal birth environment, crying, helplessness, stress, and shock/panic). Conclusion During emergencies and disasters, it is crucial to provide necessary pregnancy monitoring, information, and psychosocial support by experienced healthcare professionals.

AB  - Climate change is drastically altering the frequency, duration, and severity of compound drought-heatwave (CDHW) episodes, which present a new challenge in environmental and socioeconomic sectors. These threats are of particular importance in low-income regions with growing populations, fragile infrastructure, and threatened ecosystems. This review synthesizes emerging progress in the understanding of CDHW patterns in Brazil while providing insights about the impacts on fire occurrence and public health. Evidence is mounting that heatwaves are becoming increasingly linked with droughts in northeastern and southeastern Brazil, the Amazonia, and the Pantanal. In those regions, recent studies have begun to build a better understanding of the physical mechanisms behind CDHW events, such as the soil moisture-atmosphere coupling, promoted by exceptional atmospheric blocking conditions. Results hint at a synergy between CDHW events and high fire activity in the country over the last decades, with the most recent example being the catastrophic 2020 fires in the Pantanal. Moreover, we show that HWs were responsible for increasing mortality and preterm births during record-breaking droughts in southeastern Brazil. This work paves the way for a more in-depth understanding on CDHW events and their impacts, which is crucial to enhance the adaptive capacity of different Brazilian sectors.

AB  - Although radioactivity is released routinely at every stage of nuclear power generation, the regulation of these releases has never taken into account those potentially most sensitive-women, especially when pregnant, and children. From uranium mining and milling, to fuel manufacture, electricity generation and radioactive waste management, children in frontline and Indigenous communities can be disproportionately harmed due to often increased sensitivity of developing systems to toxic exposures, the lack of resources and racial and class discrimination. The reasons for the greater susceptibility of women and children to harm from radiation exposure is not fully understood. Regulatory practices, particularly in the establishment of protective exposure standards, have failed to take this difference into account. Anecdotal evidence within communities around nuclear facilities suggests an association between radiation exposure and increases in birth defects, miscarriages and childhood cancers. A significant number of academic studies tend to ascribe causality to other factors related to diet and lifestyle and dismiss these health indicators as statistically insignificant. In the case of a major release of radiation due to a serious nuclear accident, children are again on the frontlines, with a noted susceptibility to thyroid cancer, which has been found in significant numbers among children exposed both by the 1986 Chornobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine and the 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan. The response among authorities in Japan is to blame increased testing or to reduce testing. More independent studies are needed focused on children, especially those in vulnerable frontline and Indigenous communities. In conducting such studies, greater consideration must be applied to culturally significant traditions and habits in these communities.

AB  - Despite growing interest in urban vulnerability to climatic change, there is no systematic understanding of why some urban centers have greater social vulnerability than others. In this article, we ask whether the social vulnerability of Amazonian cities to floods and droughts is linked to differences in their spatial accessibility. To assess the accessibility of 310 urban centers, we developed a travel network and derived measures of connectivity and geographical remoteness. We found that 914,654 people live in roadless urban centers (n = 68) located up to 2,820km from their state capital. We then tested whether accessibility measures explained interurban differences in quantitative measures of social sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and an overlooked risk area, food system sensitivity. Accessibility explained marked variation in indicators of each of these dimensions and, hence, for the first time, we show an underlying spatial basis for social vulnerability. For instance, floods pose a greater disease risk in less accessible urban centers because inadequate sanitation in these places exposes inhabitants to environmental pollution and contaminated water, exacerbated by poverty and governance failures. Exploring the root causes of these spatial inequalities, we show how remote and roadless cities in Amazonia have been historically marginalized and their citizens exposed to structural violence and economic disadvantage. Paradoxically, we found that places with the highest social vulnerability have the greatest natural and cultural assets (rainforest, indigenous peoples, and protected areas). We conclude that increasing accessibility through road building would be maladaptive, exposing marginalized people to further harm and exacerbating climatic change by driving deforestation.

AB  - Introduction: During natural disaster a sudden increase in infant mortality and morbidity rates are reported. Breastfeeding practices are essential to prevent malnutrition-related mortalities among infants during disaster and displacement.
   Methods: Findings from the undertaken critical ethnographic study in the disaster relief camps of Chitral, Pakistan, were referred to identify need-based policies to promote, protect, and support breastfeeding among displaced mothers.
   Policy Implications: The study identified the need for strategic policies at sociocultural, economic, and geopolitical levels to support breastfeeding and save lives of young children during natural disasters.
   Conclusion: This article will facilitate clinicians, healthcare providers, and national and international agencies to recognize gaps in the existing policies and services targeting breastfeeding mothers during disaster and displacement.

AB  - Experiences of the 1997 financial crisis in East Asia provide strong evidence that there are serious risks that the current food, fuel, economic and financial crisis will affect child health and nutrition in the region. Using information available on the 1997 crisis, this paper evaluates its effects on nutrition status, reportable diseases, immunization status and child mortality. These results are used to model plausible estimates of the potential health and nutrition impacts of the current crisis across socioeconomic strata. The model results suggest that, if unaddressed, the current crisis could increase maternal anaemia rates by 10-20%, prevalence of low birth weight by 5-10%, childhood stunting by 3-7%, wasting by 8-16% and under-five child mortality in severely affected countries from 3-11%. The paper asserts that a range of low-cost and high-impact interventions exist that, if delivered in primary care settings without further delay, could mitigate or even reverse these adverse health and nutrition consequences.

AB  - In this review, the Basic and Translational Science Assembly of the European Respiratory Society provides an overview of the 2022 International Congress highlights. We discuss the consequences of respiratory events from birth until old age regarding climate change related alterations in air quality due to pollution caused by increased ozone, pollen, wildfires and fuel combustion as well as the increasing presence of microplastic and microfibres. Early life events such as the effect of hyperoxia in the context of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and crucial effects of the intrauterine environment in the context of pre-eclampsia were discussed. The Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) was put forward as a new point of reference for healthy human lungs. The combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial data in the HLCA has enabled the discovery of new cell types/states and niches, and served as a platform that facilitates further investigation of mechanistic perturbations. The role of cell death modalities in regulating the onset and progression of chronic lung diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target was also discussed. Translational studies identified novel therapeutic targets and immunoregulatory mechanisms in asthma. Lastly, it was highlighted that the choice of regenerative therapy depends on disease severity, ranging from transplantation to cell therapies and regenerative pharmacology.

AB  - In climate change-affected coastal areas, sea level rise, storm surges, droughts and altered rainfalls are significantly increasing salinity levels in drinking water sources. This is a major public health problem that affects many millions of people. We systematically reviewed and assessed the strength and quality of the evidence on the relationship between drinking water with high sodium levels (> 200 mgNa/l) and adverse cardiovascular, renal, and pregnancy-related health outcomes, following the PRISMA guidelines, the ROBINS-E Cochrane tool and the Navigation Guide. From five bibliographic databases, we identified 22 relevant studies, some of which assessed more than one health domain. The evidence was of moderate quality and strength. 14 analyses from eight studies at low risk of bias and four studies at moderate risk of bias, linked drinking high-salinity water to adverse health outcomes including hypertension and cardiovascular disease, impaired renal function, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, and higher infant mortality. Eight studies were inconclusive. Three analyses, of which two at low risk of bias, associated drinking high-salinity water to improved health outcomes. Overall, our findings suggest that salinisation of drinking water sources is likely to increase adverse cardiovascular, renal, and pregnancy-related health outcomes. This conclusion highlights the importance of effective and timely adaptation at scale, and calls for a revision of the WHO guidelines for the intake of salt from water. The latest WHO guidelines (2022) do not set any health-based standard for sodium levels in drinking water, a problem that affects millions of people and will worsen with climate change.

AB  - Objectives Controversy remains over whether declines in male births reported after population stressors result from either or both reduced conception of males or increased selection in utero against male fetuses. We use monthly birth cohorts to determine if Japanese male births following the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 fell below levels expected from female births and from history (i.e., autocorrelation) among cohorts exposed to the Earthquake at or after conception. Methods We apply interrupted time-series methods to 69 months (i.e., April, 2006 through December, 2011) of birth data from the most and least affected prefectures as well as from the remainder of Japan. We estimate expected male births from female births and from autocorrelation. Results Findings varied by distance from the greatest damage but suggest sensitive periods both early and late in gestation when population stressors may induce selection against males in utero. Support for reduced conception of males appeared only in the prefectures most damaged by the Earthquake. Conclusions Results align with the claim that natural selection has conserved mechanisms that reduce the odds of a male live birth during stressful times by reducing the conception of males and by increasing the rate of spontaneous abortion among male fetuses.

AB  - Background: Methods of defining hospital disaster preparedness are poorly defined in the literature, leaving wide discrepancies between a hospital's self-reported preparedness and that assessed by an objective reviewer.
   Objectives: This study compared self-reported surge capacity data from individual hospitals, obtained from a previously reported long-distance tabletop drill (LDTT) prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup tournament in Cape Town, South Africa, with surge capacity data assessed by an on-site survey inspection team.
   Methods: In this prospective, observational study, contact persons used in the prior LDTT assessing hospital disaster preparedness in the lead-up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup made surge capacity assessments (licensed bed capacity plus surge capacity beds) for the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), medical intensive care unit (MICU), and general medical/surgical beds in each hospital. Following the 2010 World Cup, this data was then re-evaluated by an on-site survey team consisting of two of the authors.
   Results: The contact persons for the individual hospitals from the LDTT underreported their individual hospital's surge capacity in 86% (95% CI, 46%-99%) of RICU beds; 100% (95% CI, 63%-100%) of MICU beds; 75% (95% CI, 40%-94%) of NICU beds; and 71% (95% CI, 35%-92%) of medical/surgical beds compared with the on-site inspection team.
   Conclusions: The contact persons for the LDTT overwhelmingly underreported surge capacity beds compared with the surge capacity determined by the on-site inspection team.

AB  - Dominant climate models suggest that large parts of Africa will experience greater climatic variability and increasing rates of drought in coming decades. This could have severe societal consequences, because the economies and food supplies of most African countries depend on rain-fed agriculture. According to leading environmental security scholars, policymakers, and nongovernmental organizations, an increase in scarcity-driven armed conflicts should also be expected. A conditional theory of environmental conflict predicts that drought increases the risk of civil war primarily when it strikes vulnerable and politically marginalized populations in agrarian societies. However, an empirical evaluation of this general proposition through a unique gridded dataset of postcolonial Africa, which combines high-resolution meteorological data with georeferenced data on civil war onset and the local ethnopolitical context, shows little evidence of a drought-conflict connection. Instead, the local risk of civil war can be explained by sociopolitical and geographic factors: a politically marginalized population, high infant mortality, proximity to international borders, and high local population density.

AB  - Background: Epidemiological and economic literature has revealed that low birth weight (LBW) is related to poor health conditions and a broader range of negative socio-economic outcomes, including academic achievement, income levels, and working status. However, Japanese evidence for labor outcomes is particularly lacking, as is the question of whether the impact of LBW on adulthood worsens when disasters occur. We aimed to reveal the impact on LBW on labor outcomes during the disaster recovery phase. Methods:We used a cross-sectional data set of 4156 national health insurance holders, males aged 40-60 years, from the Miyagi and Iwate prefectures during the earthquake recovery phase. Employing a multinomial probit and logistic model, we estimated the impact of LBW on the employment status, changes in income, and the propensity to face a decline in income with a job change. Results: The very low birth weights (VLBWs) have a disadvantage in all labor market outcomes. Compared to the non-LBWs, the VLBWs were 15.2% less likely to be full-time/self-employed and 17.1% more likely to be contingent/temporary/part-time workers. Moreover, 32.9% are more likely to face a decline in income and approximately 3.7 times more likely to change jobs leading to income decline. The LBWs were likely to face a decline in income by 8.6% and 4.6%, respectively, but no other significant effects were found on other outcomes. Conclusions: The effects were apparent for the VLBW, but not so much for the LBW. The effects became larger during the disaster recovery phase, even though the regional economies were boosted.

KW  - HEME
AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) occurs silently usually during sleep and, though remaining unexplained after autopsy, leaves footprints creating a pattern analogous to that which follows a flood of nitric acid (NO). These footprints in SIDS are associated with serious pathological changes, viz. elevated hepatic iron, bone marrow hyperplasia, hypomyelinated respiratory control centres, elevated lung immunoglobulins, cerebral hypoperfusion resembling lesions induced by chronic hypoxemia, ischemia, congenital heart disease and congenital myopathy.
   Hypoxia stimulates the immune response and the over-arousal of the immune response triggers a flood of NO. Adenosine triggers sleep. NO and adenosine are additive as dilators of coronary blood vessels. Blood pressure collapses.
   Selenium increases the activity of the enzyme ferrochelatase during incorporation of heme into cytochrome oxidase. NO binds to cytochrome oxidase, inhibiting respiration.
   When NO reaches dangerous levels, the cell turns on production of heme oxygenase. Heme is broken down to iron (Fe) carbon monoxide (CO) and bile pigments. NO has a huge affinity for hemoglobin which catalyses NO degradation to nitrate. Furthermore, NO is a product of smoke and SIDS incidence is higher in smoking mothers.

AB  - The Fukushima nuclear accident in March 2011 generated deep public anxiety and uncertainty about the future of nuclear energy. However, differently to fossil fuel plants, nuclear plants produce virtually no greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants during power generation. Here we show the effect on air pollution and infant health in the context of the temporary closure of nuclear plants by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the 1980s. After the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission intensified inspections throughout the nation, leading to the shutdown of two large nuclear power plants in the TVA area. In response to that shutdown, electricity generation shifted one to one to coal-fired power plants within TVA, increasing particle pollution in counties where they were located. Consequently, infant health may have deteriorated in the most affected places, indicating deleterious effects to public health.

AB  - Environmental epidemiologists are increasingly evaluating whether and how human exposure to vegetation (greenspace) can benefit health. Relatedly, scientists and policymakers have highlighted the need to integrate efforts to address the dual crises of accelerating climate change and rapid loss of biodiversity, including nature-based solutions. Greenspace is one solution that can protect humans from climate-related exposures, including heat, air pollution, and flooding. However, most environmental epidemiology research on greenspace occurs in high-income countries, and adverse birth outcomes, previously associated with greenspace, disproportionately occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although epidemiology research using existing survey or administrative data and satellite imagery is important for documenting broad patterns, such research is lacking in LMICs. Further, complementary, community-engaged research to inform interventions and policies is needed so that nature-based solutions with co-benefits for climate mitigation and health are adopted effectively and equitably. We provide suggestions for future research that would increase impact and call for better representation of LMICs and vulnerable communities within high-income countries in research and action on greenspace and climate-sensitive birth outcomes.

AB  - Changes in population birth outcomes, including increases in low birthweight or preterm births, have been documented after natural and manmade disasters. However, information is limited following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Disaster. In this study, we assessed whether there were long-term changes in birth outcomes post-disaster, compared to pre-disaster data, and whether residential area and food purchasing patterns, as proxy measurements of evacuation and radiation-related anxiety, were associated with post-disaster birth outcomes. Maternal and perinatal data were retrospectively collected for all live singleton births at a public hospital, located 23 km from the power plant, from 2008 to 2015. Proportions of low birthweight (<2500 g at birth) and preterm births (<37 weeks gestation at birth) were compared pre- and post-disaster, and regression models were conducted to assess for associations between these outcomes and evacuation and food avoidance. A total of 1101 live singleton births were included. There were no increased proportions of low birthweight or preterm births in any year after the disaster (merged post-disaster risk ratio of low birthweight birth: 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64-1.51; and preterm birth: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.38-1.21). No significant associations between birth outcomes and residential area or food purchasing patterns were identified, after adjustment for covariates. In conclusion, no changes in birth outcomes were found in this institution-based investigation after the Fukushima disaster. Further research is needed on the pathways that may exacerbate or reduce disaster effects on maternal and perinatal health.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to assess the effects of the Great East Japan Earthquake on hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) in the Fukushima Prefecture. Methods: We used the results of the Fukushima Health Management Survey which targeted women who gave birth from 2011-2012. Pregnant women were divided into three groups according to their residential area during the disaster (affected, middle, and less-affected area), and four groups according to pregnancy trimester during the disaster (first, second, third trimester, or conception after the disaster). Adjusted odds ratio (aORs) for HDP of each residential area was calculated using logistic regression models, with pregnancy trimester during the disaster as references. Results: Overall, 8323 women participated in the study (affected area: 2207; middle area: 5183; and less-affected area: 933). For women living in the affected and middle areas in the third trimester, the disaster was a significant risk factor for HDP (aOR: 2.61, 1.02-6.66, aOR: 1.93, 1.10-3.40, respectively). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate patient residential areas and gestational age during the time of a disaster to estimate the risk of HDP. The third trimester of pregnancy at the time of the disaster was associated with HDP for the women living in the affected and middle areas. The knowledge of the data on disaster-related obstetrical complications can help obstetric care providers in a disaster area provide appropriate medical aid in an emergency.

AB  - This paper explores what the San Diego region may look like in the year 2050 as projected changes in regional climate conditions take place. Focusing on interrelated issues of climate change, sea level rise, population growth, land use, and changes in water, energy, public health, wildfires, biodiversity, and habitat, the paper reviews the potential impacts of a changing climate by 2050 and makes recommendations for changes in planning processes at the local and regional levels to prepare for these impacts. The original research for this study was completed in 2008 by a team of 40 experts from the region including universities, nonprofit organizations, local governments, public sector agencies and private sector entities. This paper has now been updated with more recent research regarding climate change adaptation while preserving the integrity of the original research team's work. The simulated impacts discussed in this study are based on regional projections of climate change generated by scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, employing three climate models and two emissions scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The impacts are discussed in the context of significant regional growth expected during the period as well as an aging population base. Key issues explored in the report include potential inundation of six selected low-lying coastal areas in San Diego due to sea level rise, potential shortfalls in water deliveries, peak energy demand increases due to higher temperatures, growing risk of devastating wildfires, migrations of species in response to higher temperatures in an increasingly fragmented natural habitat, and public health issues associated with extreme temperature events.

AB  - This study investigates the determinants of fertility using a panel data set for 43 countries from 1900 to 2010 at five-year intervals. The regression results show that fertility increases with infant mortality and national disasters and decreases with total years of educational attainment and political development. Fertility rates fall initially and then rise with an increase in income. Average years of schooling of females has a significantly negative effect on fertility rates, whereas that of males are statistically insignificant. A woman's educational attainment at the primary and secondary levels has a pronounced negative effect on fertility rates. On the contrary, an increase in a woman's tertiary educational attainment, with the level of a man's remaining constant, tends to raise fertility rates, particularly in advanced countries, indicating that highly educated women can have a better environment for childrearing in a society with greater gender equality.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of global importance and has a worldwide distribution. This infection displays clear seasonal nature in some regions of the tropics, where the rainy season is marked by high temperatures. Household and wild animals carry leptospires and contribute to their dissemination in nature. Transmission mainly occurs by contact with water contaminated with the urine of infected animals, and consequently, it is quite widespread especially in times of rain, since many areas are subject to flooding and have poor sanitation. Serological tests demonstrate that Leptospira sp. infection in horses occurs worldwide and that the predominant serovar may vary depending on the region or infection sources. Besides systemic and ocular manifestations, leptospirosis in horses has been recognized as an important disease of the reproductive system, since it leads to the birth of weak foals, stillbirths or neonatal mortality, and mainly to abortion, usually after the sixth month of pregnancy. In this context, this review aims to gather and discuss information about the role of leptospirosis in reproductive disorders in horses.

AB  - This study uses five years of panel data (2009-2013) for Northern Kenya's Marsabit district to analyze the levels and extent of malnutrition among children aged five and under in that area. We measure drought based on the standardized normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and assess its effect on child health using mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). The results show that approximately 20 percent of the children in the study area are malnourished and a one standard deviation increase in NDVI z-score decreases the probability of child malnourishment by 12-16 percent. These findings suggest that remote sensing data can be usefully applied to develop and evaluate new interventions to reduce drought effects on child malnutrition, including better coping strategies and improved targeting of food aid.

AB  - Background: Malnutrition in children under five is a serious public problem in Indonesia. Decision makers needed the evidences to overcome Indonesian children's malnutrition. Media and academic literatures could provide those. Objectives: This case study aimed to analyse the role between mass media and academic journal in providing the evidence to solve child's malnutrition in Indonesia. Methods: This case study selected 3 forms of media, including national newspapers, magazines and television. While, academic literatures were searched through Proquest database and Google scholar from 2006 until now. Results: This study found that both academic literatures and media have suggested the basic causes of child malnutrition such as economic deprivation, low parental education, contradictory local traditional beliefs and long drought. The causes then influenced households in purchasing power for food, providing appropriate foods, housing condition, utilization of child health care, parental awareness and knowledge about child nutrition. Eventually, these led to high child morbidity, low birth weight and low child nutritional intake. Conclusion: All information about malnutrition causes is available in both mass media and academic journal, but their presentation is different. Those sources are important and complementary.

AB  - ImportanceThe associations of exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its constituents with spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) remain understudied. Identifying subpopulations at increased risk characterized by socioeconomic status and other environmental factors is critical for targeted interventions. ObjectiveTo examine associations of PM2.5 and its constituents with sPTB. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2008 to 2018 within a large integrated health care system, Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Singleton live births with recorded residential information of pregnant individuals during pregnancy were included. Data were analyzed from December 2023 to March 2024. ExposuresDaily total PM2.5 concentrations and monthly data on 5 PM2.5 constituents (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, organic matter, and black carbon) in California were assessed, and mean exposures to these pollutants during pregnancy and by trimester were calculated. Exposures to total green space, trees, low-lying vegetation, and grass were estimated using street view images. Wildfire-related exposure was measured by the mean concentration of wildfire-specific PM2.5 during pregnancy. Additionally, the mean exposure to daily maximum temperature during pregnancy was calculated. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was sPTB identified through a natural language processing algorithm. Discrete-time survival models were used to estimate associations of total PM2.5 concentration and its 5 constituents with sPTB. Interaction terms were used to examine the effect modification by race and ethnicity, educational attainment, household income, and exposures to green space, wildfire smoke, and temperature. ResultsAmong 409 037 births (mean [SD] age of mothers at delivery, 30.3 [5.8] years), there were positive associations of PM2.5, black carbon, nitrate, and sulfate with sPTB. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) per IQR increase were 1.15 (95% CI, 1.12-1.18; P < .001) for PM2.5 (IQR, 2.76 mu g/m3), 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11-1.20; P < .001) for black carbon (IQR, 1.05 mu g/m3), 1.09 (95% CI, 1.06-1.13; P < .001) for nitrate (IQR, 0.93 mu g/m3), and 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03-1.09; P < .001) for sulfate (IQR, 0.40 mu g/m3) over the entire pregnancy. The second trimester was the most susceptible window; for example, aORs for total PM2.5 concentration were 1.07 (95% CI, 1.05-1.09; P < .001) in the first, 1.10 (95% CI, 1.08-1.12; P < .001) in the second, and 1.09 (95% CI, 1.07-1.11; P < .001) in the third trimester. Significantly higher aORs were observed among individuals with lower educational attainment (eg, less than college: aOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.12-1.21 vs college [>= 4 years]: aOR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.06-1.14; P = .03) or income (<50th percentile: aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.14-1.21 vs >= 50th percentile: aOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.16; P = .02) or who were exposed to limited green space (<50th percentile: aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.15-1.23 vs >= 50th percentile: aOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.15; P = .003), more wildfire smoke (>= 50th percentile: aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.16-1.23 vs <50th percentile: aOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.09-1.16; P = .009), or extreme heat (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.42-1.59 vs mild temperature: aOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.09-1.14; P < .001). Conclusions and RelevanceIn this study, exposures to PM2.5 and specific PM2.5 constituents during pregnancy were associated with increased odds of sPTB. Socioeconomic status and other environmental exposures modified this association.

AB  - This paper discusses the various analyses of the Trinity Nuclear Test, including how they might apply to the issue of infant mortality. This paper was first drafted as a response to a letter by Rice, who commented on my earlier letter on that issue. My earlier letter commented on the National Cancer Institute's 2020 series of papers in the October Issue of Health Physics on the impact of the Trinity Nuclear Test that was conducted on unoccupied government lands on 16 July 1945. The Journal editors requested that my response to Rice be edited and submitted as a paper to ensure adequate technical review and suggested that the article also add material summarizing the series of exchanges that were published in the Journal. This article suggests that significant differences exist between various summaries of the offsite impact of the Trinity Nuclear Test and offers that Trinity might be the largest nuclear accident in terms of the impact on uninvolved civilians who were downwind following the test. It suggests areas for further study to resolve these significant differences. It also asserts that until the estimated exposures of downwind residents are resolved and an appropriate study is made of infant deaths following the Trinity Nuclear Test, the issue of infant mortality remains an unanswered, 80-y-old question.

AB  - Estimation of maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in humanitarian settings (settings of conflict, displacement and natural disaster') is challenging, particularly where communities have dissolved and geographical areas are inaccessible. During humanitarian events, the reproduction of maternal mortality figures by the media is common, and are often based on inaccurate reports. In light of such uncertainties and challenges, the aim of this article was to review and appraise the methodology and data collection tools used to measure MMR in humanitarian settings. A critical review of both grey and peer-review publications was conducted, focussing on articles published from January 1995 until December 2016. In the final review, articles that provided an estimate of MMR from a humanitarian setting were included. The assessment of study quality was based on an adapted framework for the quality of mortality studies in humanitarian settings. Overall, 13 peer-review publications and one grey publication were included in the final review. These were grouped according to settings: camp, clinic, household and census. Studies varied in their definition of MMR, and few studies objectively defined the humanitarian setting. Household-based studies were based on retrospective designs and on the recall of surviving family members. Although many studies attempted to purposively sample the populations afflicted, there was substantial evidence of selection bias; few studies were able to confirm the maternal deaths through medical certificates, or attempted to visit homes to re-inquire about deaths using verbal autopsy. The variation in methods and tools applied suggest that maternal mortality estimates are more likely to be markedly different from the true unknown level. The implications are that a standardized methodology and tools are necessary: that are consistent in definition, use a representative sample where possible, attempt to triangulate and validate data sources, and reconfirm deaths through household visits with informant interviews.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Kahramanmaras Earthquake, often referred to as the "disaster of the century," occurred on February 6, 2023. Following the 7.7 magnitude earthquake, extensive destruction and significant loss of life occurred across 10 provinces. This study aims to analyze the outcomes and share the surgical and radiologic algorithm applied to live, trauma-affected pregnant patients who were referred to the obstetrics and gynecology emergency department of our hospital following the earthquake.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study. The study included pregnant patients affected by the earthquake who were admitted to and/or referred to the obstetrics and gynecology emergency department of a tertiary hospital between February 6 and March 6, 2023. Demographic data, trauma-related findings, surgical details, and obstetric outcomes were recorded.
   RESULTS: A total of 58 pregnant earthquake victims were evaluated. The mean gestational age was 22.24 +/- 10.59 weeks. The most common obstetric complaint was pelvic pain or contractions (36.3%). Eleven patients gave birth, two via vaginal delivery and nine via cesarean section. The mean gestational age at delivery was 32.81 weeks. Curettage was performed in three patients, and hysterotomy in one patient. There were six live births and five stillbirths. In patients undergoing cesarean section, a midline incision was made. After delivery, the uterus was sutured, and intra-abdominal organs were evaluated. In cases of pelvic or other fractures, intraoperative scope devices were used. When necessary, patients were consulted by general surgery and orthopedics departments and were transferred to either the ward or the intensive care unit, depending on their clinical condition.
   CONCLUSION: Ultrasound has become the primary diagnostic tool for emergency evaluation in pregnant women. For earthquake victims who lack access to radiological assessment and require rapid clinical decisions, the recommended surgical approaches, particularly midline incisions, and intraoperative evaluations (such as the use of intraoperative scope after delivery) can be life-saving for both the baby and the mother.

AB  - Wildland fire smoke exposure affects a broad proportion of the U.S. population and is increasing due to climate change, settlement patterns and fire seclusion. Significant public health questions surrounding its effects remain, including the impact on cardiovascular disease and maternal health. Using atmospheric chemical transport modeling, we examined general air quality with and without wildland fire smoke PM2.5. The 24-h average concentration of PM2.5 from all sources in 12-km gridded output from all sources in California (2007-2013) was 4.91 mu g/m(3). The average concentration of fire-PM2.5 in California by year was 1.22 mu g/m(3) (25% of total PM2.5). The fire-PM2.5 daily mean was estimated at 4.40 mu g/m(3) in a high fire year (2008). Based on the model-derived fire-PM2.5 data, 97.4% of California's population lived in a county that experienced at least one episode of high smoke exposure (smokewave) from 2007-2013. Photochemical model predictions of wildfire impacts on daily average PM2.5 carbon (organic and elemental) compared to rural monitors in California compared well for most years but tended to over-estimate wildfire impacts for 2008 (2.0 mu g/m(3) bias) and 2013 (1.6 mu g/m(3) bias) while underestimating for 2009 (-2.1 mu g/m(3) bias). The modeling system isolated wildfire and PM2.5 from other sources at monitored and unmonitored locations, which is important for understanding population exposure in health studies. Further work is needed to refine model predictions of wildland fire impacts on air quality in order to increase confidence in the model for future assessments. Atmospheric modeling can be a useful tool to assess broad geographic scale exposure for epidemiologic studies and to examine scenario-based health impacts.

AB  - Using an exogenous measure of natural disasters based on physical intensities, I examine their impact on child mortality. I find that children, mostly, in poor countries are affected - a one standard deviation increase in the natural disaster index leads to an additional 6.77 deaths per 1000 live births in the disaster year. The impact is long lasting, extending beyond the disaster year. I provide suggestive evidence of the potential mechanisms driving these effects, namely, lower GDP and vaccination rates among children, along with an increased maternal mortality and disease incidence in low-income countries due to disasters. Using an endogenous measure of disasters based on damage records from insurance data leads to severe underestimation of the disaster impact. The results are robust to the use of mortality rates from multiple sources, different functional forms, and an extensive dynamic panel specification as well as various other tests.

AB  - A massive increase in the global prevalence of non-insulin dependent diabetes is likely to occur as ''Westernisation'' of dietary habits and patterns of physical activity becomes more widespread. Advances in molecular and cellular science may provide some useful insights and therapeutic tools to assist in the fight against the severe consequences of this epidemic. These will include the better identification of specific aetiological subtypes of the disease; the identification of new drugs through the better understanding of the biology of insulin secretion and action; and the targeting of therapies to specific subtypes of the disease. In addition, knowledge of the precise mode of action and antidiabetes drugs may facilitate the design of more effective non-pharmacological manipulations; the genetic identification of ''high risk'' asymptomatic people may allow us to target screening and preventive strategies more effectively; and investigations into the mechanisms that underlie the link between low birth weight and later diabetes should provide new routes towards treatment and prevention. Barriers to the implementation of the global measures required to stem the predicted flood of non-insulin dependent diabetes may prove insuperable, but if we are to have any success, then close collaboration between clinicians, epidemiologists, public health physicians, and laboratory scientists will be essential.

AB  - In August 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck the Baltimore/Washington, District of Columbia, corridor. The event identified a critical requirement to prepare our interprofessional team to evacuate approximately 60 neonatal patients. A needs assessment indicated that 60% of staff members had little or no knowledge of the unit's evacuation plan and 55% of respondents were not aware of their specific role in an emergency evacuation. The neonatal intensive care unit educators in collaboration with the unit's medical team, the leadership team, the hospital emergency management team, and the unit practice and professional council coordinated the design, implementation, and assessment of the simulated evacuation activity. To encourage realism within the simulated activity, prepared manikins were placed in patient rooms and assigned varying levels of acuity. The training session began with a prebrief session that included a description of the evacuation plan, delineation of roles, responsibilities based on scope of practice, use of the evacuation equipment, and unit emergency bags. Participants engaged in a debrief session following each session during which the staff notably expressed an increased confidence with the evacuation plan, roles, and operation of the evacuation equipment. In addition, the debriefing allowed for identification of latent threats, which the planning group used to streamline the evacuation process.

AB  - Objective: To investigate trends in child malnutrition in six countries in southern Africa, in relation to the HIV epidemic and drought in crop years 2001/2 and 2002/3.
   Design: Epidemiological analysis of sub-national and national surveys with related data.
   Setting: Data from Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe, compiled and analysed under UNICEF auspices.
   Subjects: Secondary data: children 0-5 years for weight-for-age; HIV prevalence data from various sources especially antenatal clinic surveillance.
   Results: Child nutritional status as measured by prevalence of underweight deteriorated from 2001 onwards in all countries except Lesotho, with very substantial increases in some provinces/districts (e.g. from 5 to 20% in Maputo (Mozambique, 1997-2002), 17 to 32% in Copperbelt (Zambia, 1999-2001/2) and 11 to 26% in Midlands province (Zimbabwe, 1999-2002)). Greater deterioration in underweight occurred in better-off areas. Areas with higher HIV/AIDS prevalences had (so far) lower malnutrition rates (and infant mortality rates), presumably because more modern areas - with greater reliance on trade and wage employment - have more HIV/AIDS. Areas with higher HIV/AIDS showed more deterioration in child nutrition. A significant area-level interaction was found of HIV/AIDS with the drought period, associated with particularly rapid deterioration in nutritional status.
   Conclusions: First, the most vulnerable may be households in more modern areas, nearer towns, to whom resources need to be directed. Second, the causes of this vulnerability need to be investigated. Third, HIV/AIDS amplifies the effect of drought on nutrition, so rapid and effective response will be crucial if drought strikes again. Fourth, expanded nutritional surveillance is now needed to monitor and respond to deteriorating trends. Finally, with or without drought, new means are needed of bringing help, comfort and assistance to the child population.

AB  - While tenure security is essential to effective land management, there is little empirical evidence on its environmental impact. Exploiting the staggered rollout of the land registry program across Greece, we find the regions covered by the mandatory program witness large declines in agricultural fire events, burned areas, and air pollutants. Agricultural data reveal that landowners in those regions mitigate fire risks through reducing stubble burning, expanding farming areas, and stocking more fire-suppression equipment. Our findings indicate that strengthening property rights can lead to more sustainable farming practices and promote long-term land investment, thereby reducing fire hazards.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Existing research has established a causal link between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and severe birth defects or consequent health impairments; however, more subtle cognitive impairments have not been explored.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether infants of mothers with at least 1 positive ZIKV test show differences in cognitive scores at ages 3 to 6 months and ages 9 to 12 months.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study recruited infants enrolled in existing ZIKV study cohorts associated with the Maternal-Infant Studies Center and the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium at the University of Puerto Rico and from the broader San Juan metropolitan area. The study took place at the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium at the University of Puerto Rico. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling if their mothers underwent ZIKV testing prenatally and were at the target ages during the study period. Infants who were born preterm (<36 weeks' gestational age), with low birth weight (<2500 g), or with a known genetic disorder were excluded. Infants were tested from ages 3 to 6 months or ages 9 to 12 months from May 2018 to April 2019. Data analysis was performed from March to April 2019.
   EXPOSURES Zika virus status was measured prenatally and in the early postnatal period using real-time polymerase chain reaction or a ZIKV IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The infants' development was assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (translated to Spanish and adapted for Puerto Rico), and assessors were blinded to each infant's ZIKV status.
   RESULTS A total of 65 study participants were included. The mean (SD) age of the infants at the time of cognitive testing was 8.98 (3.19) months. Most of the infants were white (55 [84.6%]) and Puerto Rican (64 [98.5%]); 38 of the infants were male (58.5%). General cognitive and domain-specific scores did not differ significantly between prenatally ZIKV-positive and ZIKV-negative infants except for receptive language score (mean difference = 5.52; t = 2.10; P = .04). Exposure to ZIKV (B = -5.69; beta = -0.26 [95% CI -11.01 to -0.36]; P = .04) and a measure of Hurricane Maria exposure (time without water, B = -0.05; beta = -0.27 [95% CI, -0.10 to -0.01]; P = .03) were both independently and significantly associated with receptive language scores after adjusting for key confounders.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although infants exposed to ZIKV prenatally showed unaffected motor and visually mediated cognitive development, they did show deficits in receptive language scores. Receptive language skills were also associated with the degree of exposure to Hurricane Maria, with those who spent more time without water after the hurricane having lower receptive language scores.

AB  - We adapt the basic principles of the Keynes Plan and argue for the creation of a supranational bank money (SBM) that would coexist along side national currencies and for the establishment of a new international clearing union (NICU). These principles remain timely because the fundamental causes of the instability of the international monetary system are as valid today as they were in the early forties. The new supranational money would be created against domestic earning assets of the Fed and the ECB and its quantity would be demand-driven. Our proposal is not an agreement on exchange rates, which while possible is not essential to the functioning of the SBM. NICU would not hold open positions in assets denominated in national currency and consequently would not bear exchange rate risk. NICU would be more than an office recording credit and debit entries of the supranational bank money. The financial tsunami that hit the world economy in 2007-2008 provides a unique opportunity for a coordinated strategy.

AB  - The preterm birth (PTB) rate for singletons born in the tropical Caribbean island Puerto Rico increased from 11.3% in 1994, which was comparable to rates in the U.S., to as high as 18.3% in 2006 before decreasing to 15.5% in 2012. A few studies have reported that weather extremes are associated with higher risk of preterm birth, however, the effects of ambient temperature and precipitation has not been well examined in Puerto Rico. We compiled child birth data from the National Center for Health Statistics and weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from 1994 to 2012. We explored the association between the weather factors and PTB rates with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM). We did not find direct association of lagged effect of temperature on birth outcome over monthly timescales. Both high intensity and frequency of precipitation and high frequency of storm and flood events are associated with increased risk of PTB rates. While the weather factors do not explain the marked increase and decrease in PTB rate, we emphasize the negative effects on PTB from weather extremes particularly precipitation in Puerto Rico.

AB  - Background Bangladesh's islands, because of their geographical location, frequently encounter crises like floods and river erosion, which pose significant threats to the residents' well-being and livelihoods. To delve into the effects of these disasters on livelihood and healthcare challenges, a mixed-method study was undertaken in a riverine-island near a major river of Bangladesh.Methodology Between February 15th and February 28th, 2023, a cross-sectional study was conducted on an island in Bangladesh. The quantitative method involved conducting a survey of 442 households, with a total of 2921 participants. Additionally, 10 in-depth interviews and 10 key-informant interviews were conducted using semi-structured guidelines. Qualitative interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a thematic analysis. Triangulation was employed in this study through the integration of qualitative and quantitative analysis, resulting in the presentation of findings that offer an in-depth comprehension of the phenomenon being investigated.Results River erosions and floods are common and recurring natural disasters that significantly impact the lives of the riverine island inhabitants. These disasters often disrupted their livelihoods, forced many residents to endure substandard living conditions or relocated during flood events. The island faced a low diagnostic prevalence of chronic diseases (e.g., 5.1% of adults were hypertension and 2.5% are diabetes) because of the absence of diagnostic facilities and a shortage of certified doctors. A significant number of chronic illness people in the community turned to alternative medicine sources (39.3%) such as homeopathy, Kabiraj, and Ayurvedic medicine, especially it gets increased during periods of natural disasters. Moreover, reproductive aged women revealed that 79.4% of them gave birth at home, with 6.0% of these home deliveries resulting in miscarriage or infant death. The destruction of crops, unstable job opportunities, an inadequate educational system, and a deficient healthcare delivery system exacerbated the hardships faced by the population affected by these disasters.Conclusion The failure to seek treatment for chronic diseases and undiagnosed diseases is a significant health issue among the aging adults on the island. Island residents face the challenge of establishing effective prevention strategies for the well-being of older adults especially at the period of natural disasters. It is crucial for the government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to collaborate to prevent the negative effects of floods and river erosions. This should include efforts to enhance the quality of education, healthcare services, job opportunities, and financial assistance for rebuilding homes.

AB  - Background: The present study analyzed the relation of disaster exposure prior to pregnancy with maternal characteristics and obstetric outcomes. Methods: The participants were 13,148 pregnant women recruited from 2013 to 2017. The women were classified into three groups by the severity of housing damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011: group A, house was not destroyed/did not live in the disaster area; group B, half/part of the house was destroyed; and group C, house was totally/ mostly destroyed. Maternal characteristics, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and gestational weeks were obtained using questionnaires and medical records. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the relation between disaster exposure and maternal characteristics, HDP, and GDM. A structural equation model was applied to investigate the relation of disaster exposure with HDP and gestational weeks. Results: The homes of about 11% of the women were totally/mostly destroyed. For groups B and C compared with those in group A, the adjusted ORs for HDP were 1.04 and 1.26 (P for trend = 0.01), and for GDM were 0.89 and 1.14 (P for trend = 0.9), respectively. Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) mediated 23.2% of the relation between disaster exposure and HDP. Disaster exposure was associated with gestational weeks. Conclusion: Disaster exposure at least 2.5 years before pregnancy was found to be associated with maternal characteristics and the prevalence of HDP. Pre-pregnancy BMI mediated the relation between disaster exposure and the prevalence of HDP, and gestational weeks were reduced through HDP.

AB  - This paper reviews recent research on the long-term effects of early life exposure in China, with a focus on human capital formation and policy implications. We summarize evidence from three strands of literature: natural disasters, health promotion programs, and public policies. China provides a unique context for studying early life conditions due to its limited migration, large-scale policy interventions, and distinct gender norms. Existing studies show that early life shocks have persistent negative effects on health, education, and labor market outcomes. In contrast, targeted interventions, such as pollution control, clean water provision, and health insurance expansion, significantly improve human capital, particularly for disadvantaged children. Gender norms also shape both the costs of shocks and the benefits of policies. The findings provide important lessons for designing child development policies and reducing inequality in China and other developing countries.

AB  - As part of our work on the influence of water source on reproductive outcome, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to tap water, bottled water, or deionized water treatment groups, utilizing 160 animals per treatment; animals received the water prior to and during pregnancy, Rats were shipped in four batches (A-D), Batch effects were seen for several reproductive parameters, Because the tap water supply was interrupted by an earthquake resulting in an unbalanced design, primary analyses utilized only batches C and D, which included most of the tap water-treated rats, A treatment effect with respect to resorption frequency was seen that was marginally significant using a fixed-effects analysis of variance (P = 0.053), but not when batch was entered as a random effect (P = 0.36), The data were modeled by logistic regression, controlling for batch, litter size, and batch-treatment interaction, The odds ratio comparing tap to bottled water was 1.8 (95% CI 1.0 to 3.3, P = 0,05), which was similar to the epidemiologic result that prompted this study, The magnitude of this association varied by batch, and the difference in resorption frequency was within the range of variation seen for control animals, Although these findings do not justify public health action at this time, further investigation is warranted.

AB  - Objective: Volutrauma caused by high tidal volumes contributes considerably to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Yet high tidal volumes are required to overcome dead space. In an experimental arrangement we tested whether reduction of dead space might reduce ventilation requirements and thus reduce volutrauma in preterm infants. Materials and methods: The time required to eliminate CO2 by standardized mechanical ventilation from a preterm infant's test lung flooded with CO2 was measured. Four different Y-pieces and flow sensor combinations were tested with and without a device for closed suction: Y-piece without flow sensor; integrated flow sensor; small dead-space flow sensor; and a new dead-space free-flow sensor for preterm infants. CO2 concentrations were measured by a capnograph. Mean CO2 elimination times (+/- SD) were compared. Results: Mean CO2 elimination time was 37.5 s (+/- 1.18 s) with and 37.4 s (+/- 0.97 s) without closed suction device for the Y-piece without flow sensor, 47.7 s (+/- 0.82 s) and 45.5 s (+/- 1.18 s) for the integrated flow sensor, 42.5 s (+/- 1.27 s) and 41.1 s (+/- 0.99 s) for the small dead-space flow sensor and 38.3 s (+/- 1.16 s) and 36.8 s (+/- 0.79 s) for the dead-space free-flow sensor. Conclusion: CO2 elimination time with and without closed suction device was nearly identical for the Y-piece without flow sensor and for the dead-space free-flow sensor. With both systems, ventilation requirements were significantly lower than for the integrated flow sensor and for the small dead-space flow sensor (integrated flow sensor vs dead-space free-flow sensor 23.6 and 24.5%, respectively, small dead-space flow sensor vs dead-space free flow sensor 11.7 and 10.9%, respectively); thus, we think that introduction of the innovative dead-space free-flow sensor into clinical practice might reduce incidence and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia by reduction of volutrauma.

AB  - The secondary sex ratio (the ratio of boys to girls at birth) may demonstrate a decline following community stress-inducing major destructive events. This study aims to investigate whether or not moderate adverse life events, in conjunction with endogenous psychological characteristics, can induce sufficient community stress to affect the sex ratio. From April 3rd to May 8th 2006 a moderate sized earthquake sequence occurred offshore the Greek island of Zakynthos, which had been hit by a destructive earthquake half a century earlier. The monthly sex ratio after the earthquake sequence was estimated and compared with that of previous and following years. Eleven months after the onset of the earthquakes the sex ratio fell to 1.000, and during the next two months (March and April) it declined further to 0.612. The sex ratio one year before its decline was 1.158 and over a total 6-year period, 3 years before and 3 years after the sequence, it was 1.063; the March-April decline in male births is significant (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.32-0.86, p = 0.013, and OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.36-0.91, p = 0.023, respectively). Also, the number of boys relative to girls in March-April 2007 was significantly lower than during the same months 3 years before and after the sequence (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.31-0.82, p = 0.007). The findings suggest that basic biological characteristics, such as the sex ratio, can be affected by psychological stressors interwoven with the pertaining psychology of the population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined pregnancy outcomes in New York City (NYC) and upstate New York after the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center disaster. METHODS: Using birth certificate data for NY residents (n = 1660,401 births), we estimated risk of low birthweight (LBW: < 2500 g) and preterm birth (< 37 weeks) one week after September 11th versus three weeks before, and for 10 four-week intervals post-disaster versus these intervals in the two previous years. To corroborate regression results, we used time-series analysis. RESULTS: One week after September 11th in NYC, we observed an adjusted odds of 1.44 for births < 1500 g (P = 0.07) and 1.67 for births 1500-1999 g (P = 0.01), but a decreased odds of 2000-2499 g. We found no immediate change in LBW upstate or preterm in either location. In extended analyses, we found, in both locations, increased odds of < 1500-g births around New Year and 33-36 weeks post-disaster and decreased odds of moderate preterm for several weeks post-disaster. Time-series analyses yielded similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: The events of September 11, 2001 in NYC were associated with immediate increases in births < 2000 g, slightly delayed decreased preterm delivery, and delayed increases in LBW among infants exposed periconception or in the first two trimesters. Stress may contribute to observed associations.

AB  - This report assesses the commendable progress made in maternal and child mortality reductions in Haiti prior to the January 2010 earthquake. Suggested measures that the Haitian government and international donor community can take to maintain these gains are also made. With the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) deadline of 2015 drawing nearer, the likelihood that Haiti will achieve MDG's 4 and 5 of reducing child and maternal mortality by two-thirds and three-quarters, respectively, by the end of this target year, remain questionable. In particular, the destruction inflicted on the country's health care system and health infrastructure by the 2010 earthquake have already resulted in a slowing of these gains and could potentially threaten an actual reversal of these trends. The country's Soins Obst,tricaux Gratuits and Soins Infantiles Gratuits schemes established in 2008 and 2010, which provide free health care to women, newborns and children under 5, represent examples of measures that will need to be sustained and scaled up if the country is to meet its MDG 4 and 5 targets. The Haitian government's endorsement of an increased continuum of care approach to maternal and newborn health will also be vital for future initiatives. Post-quake public health and social service reconstruction efforts will need to incorporate maternal and child health-friendly services into their designs. It also remains critical that international donors continue to meet their pledges to Haiti. The Haitian government should also take more strides to clearly delineate the maternal and child health interventions it implements, both in order to facilitate greater national learning, as well as to improve the likelihood of future replication.

AB  - This paper provides a summary of the invited talk at the 2007 CDC & ATSDR 11th Biennial Symposium on Statistical Methods conference in which a university-non-profit collaboration targeted the elimination of racial disparities in perinatal health with the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS). This program will be described in four temporal stages: the pre-program early years (1999-2001) where the health burden is defined, leading to the Health v Start nears (2001-2005), in which spatial analyses, methods to effectively disseminate GIS results, the creation of the Baton Rouge Healthy Start database, and a move toward a conceptual goal of creating a holistic neighborhood GIS-health model are all described. The Katrina Years (September 2005-early 2006) portrays the impact of the disaster and how the collaboration changed as resources from both were directed toward both response and recovery. The final section of the paper, the Post-Katrina veers (early 2006 and ongoing) describes how the health landscape of Louisiana, including Baton Rouge as well as New Orleans, has worsened after the storms. An argument is made that the relationships and GIS structure developed during the collaboration's pre-Katrina years, even though stretched, provide the flexibility to analyze and cope with a Katrina-type shock to the system.

AB  - BackgroundHigh-risk pregnancies and birth defects are often greater within communities of color where resources for a healthy pregnancy are generally lacking. Infant and maternal mortality, preterm birth, and instances of increased developmental and physical defects are related to environmental exposures (e.g., pesticides, lead in water, wildfire smoke), dietary additives, and lack of access to adequate healthcare. More frequently people of color and other under-served groups, are affected by historical inequality and unconscious bias. Compounding these disparities, research into these issues and efforts to address them are poorly supported.MethodsThe speakers in this symposium presented evidence for health disparities within communities of color to foster research aimed at identifying toxic levels of potentially hazardous dietary chemicals, or exposures in the pediatric population can focus on addressing the current inadequacy of translating scientific findings into enforceable policies.ResultsThe disparities discussed within this symposium highlighted key areas in desperate need of policy reform. In the United States, regulatory exposure levels have been established for lead exposures but frequently exceed these limits without mitigation. Neural tube defects can be prevented by a simple dietary solution such as fortification of staple foods with folic acid. Recent literature on gender as a social determinant of health has determined women suffer more negative health consequences due to social attitudes.ConclusionsUltimately, this symposium provided an understanding of the experience of disadvantaged and marginalized persons during pregnancy, illustrated the disparities that exist in reproductive health, and described the need to address and prevent them.

AB  - Mobile applications (apps) for self-management of diseases such as diabetes and for general well-being, including keeping track of food, diet, and exercise, are widely available. However, consumers face a flood of new mobile apps in the app stores and have no guidance from clinicians about choosing the appropriate app. As much as clinicians would like to support a patient-centered approach and promote health and wellness mobile apps, they may be unable to provide advice due to the lack of comprehensive and reliable app reviews. This research reviewed a selection of health and wellness mobile apps suitable for the self-management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A prototype of an ecosystem that integrated the data generated by the apps was built and its usefulness and ease of use were evaluated. The results show that the ecosystem can provide support for GDM self-management by sharing health and wellness data across the diabetes clinic.

AB  - Bushfires substantially increase the environmental health risks for people living in affected areas, especially the disadvantaged (e.g., those experiencing health inequities due to their socio-economic status, racial/ethnic backgrounds, geographic location and/or sexual orientation) and those with pre-existing health conditions. Pregnant women exposed to bushfire smoke are at a greater risk of adverse pregnancy and foetal outcomes, especially if they smoke tobacco, which may compound the toxic impacts. Bushfires may also exacerbate mental stress, leading to an increase in smoking. There are gaps in the evidence and more research is required on the combined effect of bushfire smoke and tobacco smoke on pregnant populations.

AB  - Children who experience poor nutrition during the first 1000 days of life are more vulnerable to illness and death in the near term, as well as to lower work capacity and productivity as adults. These problems motivate research to identify basic and underlying factors that influence risks of child malnutrition. Based on a structured search of existing literature, we identified 90 studies that used statistical analyses to assess relationships between potential factors and major indicators of child malnutrition: stunting, wasting, and underweight. Our review determined that wasting, a measure of acute malnutrition, is substantially understudied compared to the other indicators. We summarize the evidence about relationships between child malnutrition and numerous factors at the individual, household, region/community, and country levels. Our results identify only select relationships that are statistically significant, with consistent signs, across multiple studies. Among the consistent predictors of child malnutrition are shocks due to variations in climate conditions (as measured with indicators of temperature, rainfall, and vegetation) and violent conflict. Limited research has been conducted on the relationship between violent conflict and wasting. Improved understanding of the variables associated with child malnutrition will aid advances in predictive modeling of the risks and severity of malnutrition crises and enhance the effectiveness of responses by the development and humanitarian communities.

AB  - Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arthropod-borne viral disease of ruminants, camels and humans. It is also a significant zoonosis which may be encountered as an uncomplicated influenza-like illness, but may also present as a haemorrhagic disease with liver involvement; there may also be ocular or neurological lesions. In animals, RVF may be inapparent in non-pregnant adults, but outbreaks are characterised by the onset of abortions and high neonatal mortality. Jaundice hepatitis and death are seen in older animals. Outbreaks of RVF are associated with persistent heavy rainfall with sustained flooding and the appearance of large numbers of mosquitoes, the main vector. Localised heavy rainfall is seldom sufficient to create conditions for an outbreak; the simultaneous emergence of large numbers of first generation transovarially infected mosquitoes is also required. After virus amplification in vertebrates, mosquitoes act as secondary vectors to sustain the epidemic.

AB  - Rationale: Adverse health impacts from outdoor air pollution occur across the United States, but the magnitude of these impacts varies widely by geographic region. Ambient pollutant concentrations, emission sources, baseline health conditions, and population sizes and distributions are all important factors that need to be taken into account to quantify local health burdens.
   Objectives: To determine health impacts from ambient air pollution concentrations in the United States that exceed the levels recommended by the American Thoracic Society.
   Methods: Using a methodology that has been well established in previous "Health of the Air" reports, this study provides policyrelevant estimates for every monitored county and city in the United States for the adverse health impacts of outdoor pollution concentrations using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency design values for years 2018-2020. Additionally, for the first time, the report includes adverse birth outcomes as well as estimates of health impacts specifically attributable to wildland fires using an exposure dataset generated through CommunityMultiscale Air Quality simulations.
   Results: The adverse health burdens attributable to air pollution occur across the entire age spectrum, including adverse birth outcomes (10,660 preterm and/or low-weight births; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3,180-18,330), in addition to mortality impacts (21,300 avoidable deaths; 95% CI, 16,180-26,200), lung cancer incidence (3,000 new cases; 95% CI, 1,550-4,390), multiple types of cardiovascular and respiratorymorbidity (748,660 events; 95% CI, 326,050-1,057,080), and adversely impacted days (52.4million days; 95% CI, 7.9-92.4million days). Two different estimates of mortality impacts fromwildland fires were created based on assumptions regarding the underlying toxicity of particles fromwildland fires (low estimate of 4,080 deaths, 95% CI, 240-7,890; middle estimate of 28,000 deaths, 95% CI, 27,300-28,700).
   Conclusions: This year's report identified sizable health benefits that would be expected to occur across the United States with compliance with more health-protective air quality standards such as those recommended by the American Thoracic Society. This study also indicates that a large number of excess deaths are attributable to emissions from wildland fires; air quality management strategies outside what is required by the Clean Air Act will be needed to best address this important source of air pollution and its associated health risks.

AB  - There is a growing international awareness of the health risks associated with water, and particularly in developing countries. For example: (i) a child dies in Africa every 30s due to malaria-a disease related to stagnant water, (ii) every year flooding causes many deaths world-wide, with infant mortality due to diarrhea from contaminated flood waters posing the biggest threat, and (iii) poor sanitation and its relation to hepatitis A continues to be a serious problem. A revealing measure of the extent of such global problems is that more than half of the hospital beds in the world today are occupied by people with water-related diseases. Addressing these issues mandates an interdisciplinary approach by the world's scientific and engineering community. In this spirit a workshop was held in Phoenix to provide a forum where epidemiologists, hydraulics researchers and other stakeholders of varied backgrounds (e.g., policy makers, environmental groups etc.) could all participate in a debate on a future agenda for hydro-epidemiology. The principal outcome of the workshop was a significant appreciation of the potential for interdisciplinary research and development in hydro-epidemiology and the major contribution that hydraulics professionals could offer, in partnership with the public health community, in addressing such water related disease control and prevention challenges.

AB  - For policies and programs aiming at reducing climate risk, it is important to obtain vulnerability information at the sub-national level to identify hotspots. For the case of Costa Rica, no sub-national climate vulnerability index exists to date. To fill this gap, we constructed a climate vulnerability index at the canton level. We ground our work in the conceptual framework that vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Making extensive use of geographic information systems and publicly available data, we constructed 13 spatial layers to reflect the multi-dimensionality of vulnerability. Layers reflect for example, changes in climatic extremes, flood risk, vegetation cover, access to infrastructure (road density) and health services (distance to hospitals), as well as various socioeconomic (wealth level, employment rates, remittances, literacy rate) and demographic (infant mortality) characteristics. Following normalization, we constructed an inverse variance weighted index of canton-level climate vulnerability. We confirmed the validity of our climate vulnerability index through correlation with disaster damage data. We find the strongest climate vulnerability not only in the rural, agricultural producing border cantons (Los Chiles, Matina, Talamanca, Buenos Aires), but also for a few central urban cantons (Tibas, San Jose). Projects and interventions in these hot spot cantons may reduce sensitivity through strengthening hydrological infrastructure and economic development, while adaptive capacity may be improved through addressing barriers of remittance transfer, and via public health programs.

AB  - Sri Lanka, a non-industrialized country with limited resources, has been able to achieve a maternal mortality ratio that is markedly lower than the ratios of similar countries. Many factors have contributed to Sri Lanka's success story. A political commitment to the cause and implementation of clear policies through well-structured and organized community-based and institutional healthcare services-expanded to cover the whole country and provided free of charge-have been the foundation of maternal and child health (MCH) services in the country. The healthcare programs have been well accepted and utilized by the people as the literacy rate is more than 90% for both men and women. Public health midwives form the backbone of MCH services and provide frontline reproductive health care. More than 98% of deliveries occur in hospitals and are attended by midwives. Furthermore, 85% of women in Sri Lanka deliver in facilities served by specialist obstetricians/gynecologists. The Sri Lanka College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists plays a leading role by assisting the Family Health Bureau in making policies and guidelines, training staff, and acting as team leaders for maternity care services. This was evident after the tsunami in December 2004. National maternal mortality reviews, monitoring and evaluation of MCH activities, and relatively high contraceptive prevalence rates have also contributed to the success in Sri Lanka, which could serve as a model for other countries.

AB  - We estimate the impact of prenatal stress on early childhood development outcomes known as "middle years" or intermediate outcomes, which has not been studied previously. Using a unique measure of actual maternal stress induced by a large earthquake, we find that relative to children that were not exposed, in utero maternal stress reduces children's cognitive skills and socio-emotional problems by age 3, and that the effects are heterogeneous. The negative impacts on cognitive skills occur during the first trimester of pregnancy and are found among both low and high-income children, and boys and girls.

AB  - Infectious diseases, chronic diseases, and mental disorders in both adults and children are reported after disasters occur. The correlation between chronic diseases and mental disorders has also been reported. Moreover, disasters may affect perinatal outcomes. Thus, both adult and child health should be carefully monitored in disaster aftermath. A prospective cohort study of pregnant women and their families, the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project (TMM) Birth and Three-Generation Cohort Study (TMM BirThree Cohort Study), has been conducted since 2013. A total of 73,529 family members participated in the TMM BirThree Cohort Study. Among siblings, the proportion of "small for gestational age" was the same in the pre- and post- disaster periods. Among parents and grandparents who answered the baseline questionnaire, 5.6% in the inland area and 19.8% in the coastal area had their houses totally/mostly destroyed by the Great East Japan Earthquake. Although a depression trend due to house damage was not observed in mothers, the proportion of psychological distress was high according to house damage (P for trend = 0.04). Among parents, there was an increase in overweight persons (P for trend = 0.004 in mothers and < 0.0001 in fathers) and in the number of smokers based on the severity of house damage (P for trend = 0.002 in mothers and < 0.0001 in fathers), whereas no such trend was observed in grandparents. Continuous monitoring and support for those who need are essential. Moreover, utilizing existing cohort studies to investigate health status when we face a new disaster is desirable.

AB  - The worst disaster of natural origin in recent Canadian history occurred in May 2016 in the northern Alberta community of Fort McMurray Wood Buffalo (FMWB). Among the 88,000 people abruptly evacuated amidst a raging wildfire were approximately 1850 pregnant or pre-conception women. Based on the Allostatic Load and Preterm Birth Conceptual Framework (Olson et al., 2015) [1], a simple, cost-effective expressive writing intervention following Pennebaker's work (Pennebaker and Beall, 1986; Pennebaker et al., 2007) [2,3] was implemented in a primary study to help mitigate the negative effects of stress on a sample of these women and their unborn children. Journal writing served as an intervention in the primary study while the contents of the journal entries became the data analyzed in this qualitative study. This study utilized both inductive and deductive thematic analysis of journal entries completed by 54 women over four consecutive days (15 min/day). Deductive analysis followed a coding structure that was generated from two resilience scales. Themes that emerged during inductive analysis were also coded. The main themes that emerged described the women's challenging experiences: fears for themselves and their offspring, fire-related and past trauma, and relationship changes. Resilience characteristics and practices also emerged from the writings and mirrored those found in the literature: (a) posttraumatic growth, (b) adaptability, (c) emotional/social connectedness, (d) composure, and (e) reasoning. This paper highlights the challenging experiences of pregnant women exposed to a disaster and the resilience they demonstrated in the face of the tragedy.

AB  - The attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) created an acute environmental disaster of enormous magnitude. This study characterizes the environmental exposures resulting from destruction of the WTC and assesses their effects on health. Methods include ambient air sampling; analyses of outdoor and indoor settled dust; high-altitude imaging and modeling of the atmospheric plume; inhalation studies of WTC dust in mice; and clinical examinations, community surveys, and prospective epidemiologic studies of exposed populations. WTC dust was found to consist predominantly (95%) of coarse particles and contained pulverized cement, glass fibers, asbestos, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polychlorinated furans and dioxins. Airborne particulate levels were highest immediately after the attack and declined thereafter. Particulate levels decreased sharply with distance from the WTC. Dust pH was highly alkaline (pH 9.0-11.0). Mice exposed to WTC dust showed only moderate pulmonary inflammation but marked bronchial hyperractivity. Evaluation of 10,116 firefighters showed exposure-related. P increases in cough and bronchial hyperreactivity. Evaluation of 183 cleanup workers showed new-onset cough (33%), wheeze (18%), and phlegm production (24%). Increased frequency of new-onset cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath were also observed in community residents. Follow-up of 182 pregnant women who were either inside or near the WTC on I I September showed a 2-fold increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. In summary, environmental exposures after the WTC disaster were associated with significant adverse effects on health. The high alkalinity of WTC dust produced bronchial hyperreactivity, persistent cough, and increased risk of asthma. Plausible causes of the observed increase in SGA infants include maternal exposures to PAH and particulates. Future risk of mesothelioma may be increased, particularly among workers and volunteers exposed occupationally to asbestos. Continuing follow-up of all exposed populations is required to document the long-term consequences of the disaster.

AB  - My career as an accidental nutritionist began with my immersion in cholera control, a cyclone disaster, a smallpox epidemic, and formal training in ophthalmology and epidemiology. Interest in blindness prevention inexplicably led me to (re)pioneer the effects, treatment, and prevention of vitamin A deficiency, while faced with intense criticism by many leading scientists in the nutrition community. The resulting efforts by the World Health Organization and UNICEF in support of programs for the global control of vitamin A deficiency still face vocal opposition by some senior scientists, despite having been estimated to have saved tens of millions of children from unnecessary death and blindness. This entire journey was largely an accident!

AB  - The immediate aftermath of Katrina focused the world's attention on the vulnerability of the urban poor and racial/ethnic minority groups in New Orleans. This vulnerability can be viewed in terms of site, the proximity of a neighborhood to a hazard, and situation, the social context of that neighborhood. Vulnerabilities, associated with demographic characteristics such as being poor, being a member of a racial/ethnic minority group, and being female, will strengthen the force of a disaster. This paper uses a site and situation approach to show how maps of the five main sources of disaster-related stress in New Orleans can be used to predict where counseling resources should be targeted.

AB  - Due to global warming, an increased number of open fires is becoming a major contributor to PM2.5 pollution and thus a threat to public health. However, the burden of stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM2.5 is unknown. In low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is a co-occurrence of high baseline stillbirth rates and frequent firestorms, which may lead to a geographic disparity. Across 54 LMICs, we conducted a self-matched case-control study, making stillbirths comparable to the corresponding livebirths in terms of time-invariant characteristics (e. g., genetics) and duration of gestational exposure. We established a joint-exposure-response function (JERF) by simultaneously associating stillbirth with fire-and non-fire-sourced PM2.5 concentrations, which were estimated by fusing multi-source data, such as chemical transport model simulations and satellite observations. During 2000-2014, 35,590 pregnancies were selected from multiple Demographic and Health Surveys. In each mother, a case of stillbirth was compared to her livebirth(s) based on gestational exposure to fire-sourced PM2.5. We further applied the JERF to assess stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM2.5 in 136 non-Western countries. The disparity was evaluated using the Gini index. The risk of stillbirth increased by 17.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-35.7%) per 10 & mu;g/m3 increase in fire-sourced PM2.5. In 2014, referring to a minimum-risk exposure level of 10 & mu;g/m3, total and fire-sourced PM2.5 contributed to 922,860 (95% CI: 578,451-1,183,720) and 49,951 (95% CI: 3,634-92,629) stillbirths, of which 10% were clustered within the 6.4% and 0.6% highest-exposure pregnancies, respectively. The Gini index of stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM2.5 was 0.65, much higher than for total PM2.5 (0.28). Protecting pregnant women against PM2.5 exposure during wildfires is critical to avoid stillbirths, as the burden of fire-associated stillbirths leads to a geographic disparity in maternal health.

AB  - Introduction: Improved health outcomes are associated with neonatal and pediatric critical care in well-organized, cohesive, regionalized systems that are prepared to support and rehabilitate critically ill victims of a mass casualty event. However, present systems lack adequate surge capacity for neonatal and pediatric mass critical care. In this document, we outline the present reality and suggest alternative approaches.
   Methods: In May 2008, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care published guidance on provision of mass critical care to adults. Acknowledging that the critical care needs of children during disasters were unaddressed by this effort, a 17-member Steering Committee, assembled by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education with guidance from members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, convened in April 2009 to determine priority topic areas for pediatric emergency mass critical care recommendations.
   Steering Committee members established subcommittees by topic area and performed literature reviews of MEDLINE and Ovid databases. The Steering Committee produced draft outlines through consensus-based study of the literature and convened October 6-7, 2009, in New York, NY, to review and revise each outline. Eight draft documents were subsequently developed from the revised outlines as well as through searches of MEDLINE updated through March 2010.
   The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts from diverse public health, medical, and disaster response fields, convened in Atlanta, GA, on March 29-30, 2010. Feedback on each manuscript was compiled and the Steering Committee revised each document to reflect expert input in addition to the most current medical literature.
   Task Force Recommendations: States and regions (facilitated by federal partners) should review current emergency operations and devise appropriate plans to address the population-based needs of infants and children in large-scale disasters. Action at the state, regional, and federal levels should address legal, operational, and information systems to provide effective pediatric mass critical care through: 1) predisaster/mass casualty planning, management, and assessment with input from child health professionals; 2) close cooperation, agreements, public-private partnerships, and unique delivery systems; and 3) use of existing public health data to assess pediatric populations at risk and to model graded response plans based on increasing patient volume and acuity.

AB  - This study examines the impact of air pollution from straw burning on human cognitive health in China by linking household health surveys with PM2.5 emissions derived from remote sensing data on fire activity. The identification strategy leverages the spatial dispersion of air pollutants due to exogenous wind directions. The results indicate that PM2.5 emissions from upwind straw burning have a negative impact on cognitive functions of respondents aged 55 and above, but PM2.5 emissions from downwind fires do not. The impact is transitory and caused by contemporaneous PM2.5 emissions on the day of cognitive testing. Our findings demonstrate a link from air pollution to cognitive declines and suggest that through this link, climate change could result in additional health costs by increasing the risk of wildfires.

AB  - Background: The reproductive and mental health of women contributes significantly to their overall well-being. Three of the eight Millennium Development Goals are directly related to reproductive and sexual health while mental disorders make up three of the ten leading causes of disease burden in low and middle-income countries. Among mental disorders, depression and anxiety are two of the most prevalent. In the context of slower progress in achieving Millennium Development Goals in developing countries and the ever-increasing man-made and natural disasters in these areas, it is important to understand the association between reproductive health and mental health among women with post-disaster experiences.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with a sample of 387 women of reproductive age (15-49 years) randomly selected from the October 2005 earthquake affected areas of Pakistan. Data on reproductive health was collected using the Centers for Disease Control reproductive health assessment toolkit. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, while earthquake experiences were captured using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. The association of either depression or anxiety with socio-demographic variables, earthquake experiences, reproductive health and access to health facilities was estimated using multivariate logistic regression.
   Results: Post-earthquake reproductive health events together with economic deprivation, lower family support and poorer access to health care facilities explained a significant proportion of differences in the experiencing of clinical levels of depression and anxiety. For instance, women losing resources for subsistence, separation from family and experiencing reproductive health events such as having a stillbirth, having had an abortion, having had abnormal vaginal discharge or having had genital ulcers, were at significant risk of depression and anxiety.
   Conclusion: The relationship between women's post-earthquake mental health and reproductive health, socio-economic status, and health care access is complex and explained largely by the socio-cultural role of women. It is suggested that interventions that consider gender differences and that are culturally appropriate are likely to reduce the incidence.

AB  - Objective: Research in animals has shown that exposure to stressors during pregnancy is associated with offspring behavioural disorders. We aimed to study the effect of in utero exposure to the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, and maternal anxiety presumably associated with that exposure, on behaviour disorder observed at age 14.
   Method: Exposed (n = 232) and non-exposed Finnish twins (n = 572) were compared. A semi-structured interview was used to assess lifetime symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms.
   Results: Adolescents who were exposed from the second trimester in pregnancy onwards, had a 2.32-fold risk (95% CI: 1.13-4.72) of having lifetime depression symptoms, an increased risk of fulfilling DSM-III-R criteria of a major depressive disorder (OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.06-5.7), and a 2.01-fold risk (95% CI: 1.14-3.52) of having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.
   Conclusion: Perturbations in fetal brain development during the second trimester may be associated with the increased prevalence of depressive and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.

AB  - Body size and growth data were gathered on 387 wild brush-tailed phascogales captured between 1992-1997 in south-western Australia. This marsupial has not previously been studied in Western Australia. Compared with Victorian phascogales, those in the south-west (single region) are typically 20-30% smaller in mass, smaller in skeletal measurements, and sexual size dimorphism is less. Habitat quality was correlated with body size and the largest phascogales were found in swamp/gully systems. These findings suggest food is a normally limiting resource for this species in the south-west environment. Additionally, a significant decrease in growth and size occurred during a drought year (1994), and growth of young seemed restricted during dependency. Maternal mortality appeared high during late lactation as orphaned, unweaned young were encountered in nest boxes. In 1995 adult males were 25% less in mass than usual; females 15% less. Population decline followed and by 1996 capture rates were 1/3 of that typically found for the time of year. Recovery was not apparent until two years after drought (early 1997). In this food-limited environment phascogale populations appear particularly vulnerable to annual fluctuations in rainfall.

AB  - Malaria vector-anopheles mosquitoes thrive well and transmit the parasite in moisture-laden landscapes in wanner climates. Congested cohabitation of animals and humans, like in agroforestry, near residential areas is ideal malaria ecology Its afflictions account for high infant mortality and reports of yellow fever, generally in sub-Sahara Africa, and Owerri in particular Unmanaged land use creates malaria habitats in places with flooding, improper drainage/drainage discharge or flow, poor housing and congested living conditions. The objective of this study is to identify the ecology and transmission of malaria for the purpose of mitigation, evaluate the vector's machine space and its relativity to residential land use, create the temporal and spatial resolutions of the habitats to identify associated health risks, and classify the changing land use with prevalence of malaria in Owerri urban. ERDAS IMAGINE software was used for land use classification, and a GIS was use to disseminate the results

AB  - The major staple food crops production is not able to fulfill food requirement of the global population due to relatively higher population growth rate in developing countries. The research on these crops for exploring their ultimate yield potential is currently at a plateau level. To replace the existing pressure on these major crops there is an urgent need to explore other alternative crops having the potential to replace and fulfill the available food demand. FAO statistics reveal that there is a high frequency of low birth weight children in the developing countries, which is primarily due to deficiency of micronutrients in the mother's diet. Amaranth, an underutilized crop and a cheap source of proteins, minerals, vitamin A and C, seems to be a future crop which can substantiate this demand due to its tremendous yield potential and nutritional qualities, also recently gained worldwide attention. Recently, current interest in amaranth also resides in the fact that it has a great amount of genetic diversity, phenotypic plasticity, and is extremely adaptable to adverse growing conditions, resists heat and drought, has no major disease problem, and is among the easiest of plants to grow in agriculturally marginal lands. The present review is an effort to gather the available knowledge on various diversified fields of sciences for the future exploitation of the crop.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Universal prenatal screening for cytomegalovirus is not currently recommended in the United States, as no effective interventions have previously been available. With growing evidence that treating maternal first trimester primary cytomegalovirus infections with valacyclovir reduces vertical transmission, universal screening may become an important tool in congenital cytomegalovirus prevention. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the cost-effectiveness of a universal screening approach for maternal cytomegalovirus in the first trimester of pregnancy followed by valacyclovir treatment in positive cases for prevention of the sequelae of congenital cytomegalovirus. STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare outcomes of universal screening and subsequent valacyclovir treatment in a theoretical cohort of 2,869,141 individuals, the estimated number of pregnant people in the United States who receive prenatal care by the first trimester. Individuals found to be immunoglobulin G positive, immunoglobulin M positive, and to have low immunoglobulin G avidity were considered to have primary cytomegalovirus infection and received valacyclovir. Outcomes included cases of vertical cytomegalovirus transmission, abortions, stillbirths, neonatal deaths, cases of hearing loss, cases of neurodevelopmental disabilities, costs, and quality-adjusted life years. Model inputs were derived from literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed via tornado analysis, univariable sensitivity analysis, and multivariable sensitivity analysis with Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: In our study, universal screening in the first trimester for primary cytomegalovirus and subsequent treatment with valacyclovir positive cases decreased adverse outcomes by preventing 2898 vertical transmissions, 94 abortions, 19 stillbirths, 11 neonatal deaths, 460 cases of hearing loss, and 263 cases of neurodevelopmental disability. Universal screening and subsequent treatment was the dominant strategy as saved 242.2 million dollars and led to 3437 additional quality-adjusted life years. Tornado analysis demonstrated that there were no threshold values which would change the model results, when all variables were varied across a predetermined range. Univariable sensitivity analyses demonstrated that even with decreasing specificity of screening tests, decreasing maternal utility of neonatal hearing loss, and increasing the price screening up to 17 times the current cost, universal screening remained the cost-effective strategy. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrated that the screening strategy remained cost-saving in 100% of trials. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that screening for first trimester primary cytomegalovirus may be a cost-saving intervention, identification of cases allows for the provision of treatment, which in turn reduces vertical cytomegalovirus transmission and costly sequelae.

AB  - Background Climate change is one of the most complex and important health threats of the 21st century. The knowledge of the impact of climate change on health is expanding rapidly. However, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the impact of climate change on the interlinked pregnancy, perinatal and infant periods. Hence, the objective of this study was to provide an overview of the effects of changing weather and climate hazards on maternal and infant health during pregnancy, the perinatal period and infancy.Methods We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed original articles and reviews found in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, Global Health and WHO regional databases on the subject between January 2000 and May 2025. The included articles were in the English language, detailed exposure to climate change hazards during pregnancy, the perinatal period and up to 1 year of age in the child, with an outcome related to health.Results In total, 596 reviews and original articles were included in the analysis. Our findings demonstrate large differences in the number and types of studies for each climate-related hazard. Direct health effects from rising temperatures and extreme weather events, as well as indirect health effects such as infectious diseases, food insecurity, forced migration and socioeconomic changes due to climate change, have clear negative consequences for pregnant women and infants.Conclusions There is a large evidence base showcasing the harmful impact of climate change on pregnant women and infants through a variety of pathways. Action is urgently needed at all levels to address climate change and there is a need to implement large-scale mitigation and adaptation efforts that protect the health and well-being of pregnant women and infants everywhere.

AB  - Freud's 1911 and Niederland's 1959 problematic interpretations of Schreber's Memoirs set off a flood of secondary literature. In both selected facts were paired with a plethora of fictions. The narratives of Schreber father and son were misdescribed, misdiagnosed, and misinterpreted, errors have been uncritically copied by commentators ever since. Freud's theory of homosexuality as a cause of paranoia has not stood the test of time. In 1963 Niederland himself stated that the data he collected on Schreber father and son do not explain Schreber's second illness. A further misconception was to totalize both Schreber as person and the content of his book as psychotic, controverted by the fact that Schreber recovered by 1897 and the book is a creative essay with a profound moral message. Schreber's hermaphroditic fantasies were neither homosexual desires toward psychiatrist Flechsig nor morbid delusions but images of an identification with or compassion for his wife who suffered repeated miscarriages and stillbirths. The author revisits the description, diagnosis, dynamics, and deontology of Schreber's story from the perspective of dramatology and narratology and adds new information and insights. The goal of this essay is not only historical, but also a clinical and practical approach to fantasy and delusion.

AB  - Meerkats are group-living, insectivorous herpestids in which subordinate members provide extensive care for the dominant female's young. In contrast to some cooperative breeders, subordinate female meerkats are physiologically able to reproduce and occasionally do so successfully; their attempts are more frequently 'suppressed' via eviction or infanticide by the dominant female. Spontaneous abortion and neonatal loss occur with some regularity, further negatively impacting reproductive success. Here, we compared the reproductive outcomes and endocrine profiles, including of serum progesterone (P-4), serum estradiol (E-2), and fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCm), of dominant and subordinate dams residing within their clans in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa. Our study spanned years of drought, which reduced insect abundance and represented a substantial environmental stressor. Meerkat pregnancies were identified at mid-term and culminated either in spontaneous abortions or full-term deliveries, after which pups were either lost prior to emergence from the natal den (usually within 2 days of birth) or emerged at 2-3 weeks. Neonatal loss exceeded fetal loss for all females, and contributed to narrowing the status-related disparity in female reproductive output seen during less arid periods. Although E-2 concentrations were significantly lower in subordinate than dominant females, they were sufficient to support gestation. Absolute E-2 concentrations may owe to androgenic precursors that also attain highest concentrations in dominant dams and may mediate aggression underlying female reproductive skew. Pregnancies terminating in fetal loss were marked by significantly lower 134 concentrations in mid-gestation and modestly lower E-2 concentrations overall. Consistently high fGCm concentrations further increased across trimesters, particularly (but not consistently) in subordinates and in aborted pregnancies. Environmental stressor may modulate reproductive outcomes in meerkats through their influence on sex steroids and their effects on intragroup competition. The social and eco-physiological factors affecting intraspecific variation in reproductive output, even in obligate cooperative breeders, may be most apparent during extreme conditions, reflecting the benefits of long-term studies for assessing the impact of climate change.

AB  - Iodine 131 (I-131), the principal component of nuclear fallout from the Chernobyl accident, concentrates in the thyroid gland and may pose risks to fetal development. To evaluate this, neonatal outcomes following the accident in April of 1986 were investigated in a cohort of 2582 in utero-exposed individuals from northern Ukraine for whom estimates of fetal thyroid I-131 dose were available. We carried out a retrospective review of cohort members' prenatal, delivery and newborn records. The relationships of dose with neonatal anthropometrics and gestational length were modeled via linear regression with adjustment for potentially confounding variables. We found similar, statistically significant dose-dependent reductions in both head circumference (-1.0 cm/Gy, P = 0.005) and chest circumference (-0.9 cm/Gy, P = 0.023), as well as a similar but non-significant reduction in neonatal length (-0.6 cm/Gy, P = 0.169). Gestational length was significantly increased with increasing fetal dose (0.5 wks/Gy, P = 0.007). There was no significant (P > 0.1) effect of fetal dose on birth weight. The observed associations of radioiodine exposure with decreased head and chest circumference are consistent with those observed in the Japanese in utero-exposed atomic bomb survivors.

AB  - Climate change is one of the major global health threats to the world's population. It is brought on by global warming due in large part to increasing levels of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity, including burning fossil fuels (carbon dioxide), animal husbandry (methane from manure), industry emissions (ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide), vehicle/factory exhaust, and chlorofluorocarbon aerosols that trap extra heat in the earth's atmosphere. Resulting extremes of weather give rise to wildfires, air pollution, changes in ecology, and floods. These in turn result in displacement of populations, family disruption, violence, and major impacts on water quality and availability, food security, public health and economic infrastructures, and limited abilities for civil society to maintain citizen safety. Climate change also has direct impacts on human health and well-being. Particularly vulnerable populations are affected, including women, pregnant women, children, the disabled, and the elderly, who comprise the majority of the poor globally. Additionally, the effects of climate change disproportionally affect disadvantaged communities, including low income and communities of color, and lower-income countries that are at highest risk of adverse impacts when disasters occur due to inequitable distribution of resources and their socioeconomic status. The climate crisis is tilting the risk balance unfavorably for women's sexual and reproductive health and rights as well as newborn and child health. Obstetrician/gynecologists have the unique opportunity to raise awareness, educate, and advocate for mitigation strategies to reverse climate change affecting our patients and their families. This article puts climate change in the context of women's reproductive health as a public health issue, a social justice issue, a human rights issue, an economic issue, a political issue, and a gender issue that needs our attention now for the health and well-being of this and future generations. FIGO joins a broad coalition of international researchers and the medical community in stating that the current climate crisis presents an imminent health risk to pregnant people, developing fetuses, and reproductive health, and recognizing that we need society-wide solutions, government policies, and global cooperation to address and reduce contributors, including fossil fuel production, to climate change.

AB  - Background Growing evidence shows an association between in utero exposure to natural disasters and child behavioral problems, but we still know little about the development of specific psychopathology in preschool-aged children. Methods Preschool children (n = 163, mean age = 3.19, 85.5% racial and ethnic minorities) and their parents (n = 151) were evaluated annually at ages 2-5 to assess the emergence of psychopathology using the Preschool Age Psychopathological Assessment (PAPA), a parent-report structured diagnostic interview developed for preschool-age children. Sixty-six (40.5%) children were exposed to Sandy Storm (SS) in utero and 97 (59.5%) were not. Survival analysis evaluated patterns of onset and estimated cumulative risks of psychopathology among exposed and unexposed children, in total and by sex. Analyses were controlled for the severity of objective and subjective SS-related stress, concurrent family stress, and demographic and psychosocial confounders, such as maternal age, race, SES, maternal substance use, and normative prenatal stress. Results Exposure to SS in utero was associated with a substantial increase in depressive disorders (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 16.9, p = .030), anxiety disorders (HR = 5.1, p < .0001), and attention-deficit/disruptive behavioral disorders (HR = 3.4, p = .02). Diagnostic rates were elevated for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; HR = 8.5, p = .004), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; HR = 5.5, p = .01), oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD; HR = 3.8, p = .05), and separation-anxiety disorder (SAD; HR = 3.5, p = .001). Males had distinctively elevated risks for attention-deficit/disruptive behavioral disorders (HR = 7.8, p = .02), including ADHD, CD, and ODD, whereas females had elevated risks for anxiety disorders (HR = 10.0, p < .0001), phobia (HR = 2.8, p = .02) and depressive disorders (HR = 30.0, p = .03), including SAD, GAD, and dysthymia. Conclusions The findings demonstrate that in utero exposure to a major weather-related disaster (SS) was associated with increased risk for psychopathology in children and provided evidence of distinct psychopathological outcomes as a function of sex. More attention is needed to understand specific parent, child, and environmental factors which account for this increased risk, and to develop mitigation strategies.

AB  - At this early point in the 21st century a major concern that we face is the future possible effects of people-induced global warming. The predicted effects are severe, but argued by some to be avoidable if we act now. Here we consider the dimensions of another disaster: one for which not only the causes, but also their horrific consequences, are current worldwide. The implicit question is 'why are we more worried about future disasters than those already occurring?' The worldmapper collection of cartograms (where a map is used like a pie-chart to present data) is used here to illustrate the extent of international inequalities in health and living conditions, discussed in relation to other aspects of human lives. Though the shape that we can see the world is in is shocking, we can also envisage a positive future. We compare these current global times to more local past times experienced during the ravaging inequalities of Victorian Britain. We use Britain simply as an example. We end by suggesting a further step the current British Prime Minister could make in his thinking. Doing this we can see the potential for environmental reconstruction, which would result (as it did before) in considerable reductions in infant mortality. Our common future is not already mapped out; it is still to be won.

AB  - Disregarding reproductive health in situations of conflict or natural disaster has serious consequences, particularly for women and girls affected by the emergency In on effort to protect the health and save the lives of women and girls in crises, international standards for five priority reproductive health activities that must be implemented at the onset of an emergency have been established for humanitarian actors: humanitarian coordination, prevention of and response to sexual violence, minimisation of HIV transmission, reduction of maternal and neonatal death and disability, and planning for comprehensive reproductive health services. The extent of implementation of these essential activities is explored in this paper in the context of refugees in Jordan fleeing the war in Iraq. Significant gaps in each area exist, particularly coordination and prevention of sexual violence and core for survivors. Recommendations for those responding to this crisis include designating a focal point to coordinate implementation of priority reproductive health services, preventing sexual exploitation and providing clinical care for survivors of sexual violence, providing emergency obstetric care for oil refugees, including a 24-hour referral system, ensuring adherence to standards to prevent HIV transmission, making condoms free and available, and planning for comprehensive reproductive health services.

AB  - The inferior vena cava (IVC) is the largest single vein in humans. However, during embryogenesis, abnormalities can occur resulting in a duplicated IVC. The portal vein (PV) offers the main blood flood to the liver, forming by the left and right PV. A number of anatomical variations are noticed, underlying the great importance of the pre-operative imaging workup. This case report presents a duplicated IVC and a trifucated PV that were incidentally found in an 82 year-old Caucasian male with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure). Although some anatomical variations, including the duplication of the IVC and the trifurcation of PV, may be rare to the general population, the suspicion of their existence should always be taken under consideration from surgeons during hepatobiliary or retroperitoneal operations.

AB  - Carbon-based microscopic particles have provided a crucial line of evidence in understanding the coupling between humans and fires. Through the sedimentary record, they have informed our understandings of the patterns of climate and humans on fire activity through time. The extent of contemporary atmospheric biomass burning emissions has become apparent through satellite monitoring, motivated by concerns about the effect on the climate system. Sophisticated monitoring techniques designed to monitor industrial pollution have provided a data stream useful to determine the impacts on human health of wildfire smoke: we review this rapidly expanding field. The key findings are that biomass smoke is quantitatively and qualitatively different from urban air pollution and that there is no safe' level of biomass smoke exposure. Managing fires and smoke impacts will become increasingly challenging as the climate continues to warm and demands understanding the trade-off between wildfire and planned burns. The health impacts from severe smoke events are substantial when large populations are affected resulting in measurable increases in illness, hospital admissions, and deaths. The health impacts are not evenly distributed, and large segments of the population fall into higher risk groups. People in these categories are also likely to be adversely affected by the comparatively minor episodes of pollution generated by smaller planned burns. Planned burns thus need active programmes of public communication and air quality monitoring to ensure that the overall public health benefits of the intervention can be achieved with the minimum possible adverse impacts on higher risk individuals.

AB  - Shallow groundwater is the main source for drinking water in Kabul, Afghanistan. It comes from a multitude of shallow hand-pumped wells spread over the whole city area. The groundwater is characterised by slightly oxic redox conditions. Interactions with aquifer carbonates lead to near-neutral pH and high degrees of hardness. The mostly negative water budget of the Kabul Basin is the result of strong evaporation which leads to an increase in salt and also of some undesirable constituents, e.g. borate. Several years of drought have aggravated this problem. The shallow groundwater in the city has received tremendous amounts of pollution due to a lack of proper waste disposal and sewage treatment. Common indicators are elevated concentrations of nutrients such as nitrate and faecal bacteria. The high infant mortality can at least partially be attributed to the insufficient water hygiene. Acid generated during the mineralisation of the wastewater is hidden due to the strong pH buffering capacity of the groundwater system. Redox and pH conditions preclude significant mobilisation of trace metals and metalloids.

AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between health outcomes at birth and fetal exposure to temperature shocks in rural Colombia during 1999-2008. We overcome a limitation of previous studies, confined by small samples and restricted areas, by using records on nearly 1.5 million births. We exploit variations in exposure to temperature shocks by municipality and by year and month of conception in a fixed effects model. We find that exposure to moderate heat waves during the third trimester of pregnancy reduces the birthweight of the infant by about 4.1 g. Furthermore, exposure to moderate cold shocks during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy reduces the length at birth by 0.014-0.018 cm. We also find evidence of the negative effects of heat weaves in Apgar tests at a magnitude of -0.2 to -0.6 percentage points of the normal Apgar score. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Limited access to safe, timely banked blood is a critical barrier to providing basic surgical care in resource-limited settings globally. Contextual, locally driven data are required to elucidate country needs, develop effective interventions, and guide policy decisions. Objective: We employ qualitative methodology to describe barriers faced and solutions proposed by front-line obstetric providers in Bihar - a poor, populous Indian state where maternal mortality exceeds the national average. We aim to make locally driven recommendations for ongoing policy work in India to strengthen the country's blood transfusion system. Methods: From February to May 2016, two researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 obstetric providers across Bihar. Snowball sampling was employed until thematic saturation was reached. Following immersion into de-identified texts and dual codebook development, a primary analyst completed topical coding, and a secondary analyst confirmed reproducibility. Results: Providers report that pervasive banked blood shortages force hospitals to require replacement donation, but patients' families often cannot or will not donate. Providers wait one to six hours for blood, depending on availability of staff and supplies, blood bank proximity, and the ability of the patient being treated to navigate the system. Providers feel forced to refer their patients, often to distant, poorly equipped centers. Providers identify donor education, improved infrastructure, and improved local coordination as focus areas for intervention. Conclusions: A multi-stakeholder approach that aims to increase blood donation through community education, mitigate limited infrastructure through short-term workarounds, and improve local-level coordination through state support and policy change is required in Bihar. This study generates data to guide policy and future research aimed at generating affordable, contextually appropriate interventions to the blood drought.

AB  - Objective.-To determine the positive predictive value (PPV) of a clinical diagnosis vs laboratory testing for malaria in a remote field setting following a natural disaster.
   Methods.-During an observational study, as part of a disaster response in Mozambique, patients were clinically diagnosed and treated for malaria. The population included native tribes in remote areas and displaced persons in refugee camps representing all age groups, male and female. The diagnosis was made if patients exhibited at least 3 of the following historical features: fever, chills, headache, and nausea/vomiting (N/V). In addition they had to have either a tactile fever or palpable spleen. At the conclusion of the mission, 28 patients were prospectively tested with an antigen-capture assay for P. falciparum to determine the PPV of clinical diagnosis vs definitive laboratory testing.
   Results.-During the study period, 1215 of 4064 (30%) patients were diagnosed with malaria based on clinical presentation. On our final day, 28 consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of malaria were tested using an antigen-capture assay for P. falciparum. Of those, 25 tested positive-yielding a PPV of 89% (CI 0.78-1.01).
   Conclusion.-In a remote field setting where malaria is endemic/epidemic, diagnosis of malaria based on selected historical and physical findings is possible with a high positive predictive value.

AB  - This paper investigates how climate change and poverty affect child health inequality across 63 provinces in Vietnam from 2006 to 2023. By examining deaths and economic losses from storms and floods, we assess climate change's impact; while, infant mortality rate (IMR) and under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) serve as indicators of child health inequality. Findings reveal that climate change directly worsens child health inequality and exacerbates it indirectly by increasing poverty. Notably, the effects on U5MR are more pronounced than on IMR. Additionally, child vaccinations, healthcare infrastructure, and access to clean water are vital in reducing health disparities and mitigating climate change's harmful effects on child health.

AB  - Air pollution, a leading environmental health risk, claims millions of lives yearly, impacting health across the lifespan. Despite widespread acknowledgement of air pollution-related disease burdens, eliminating air pollution remains challenging. Many regions are reliant on fossil fuels or biomass for basic survival, and developed economies striving to reduce air pollution face persistent barriers. Climate change complicates intervention efforts, as rising temperatures and extreme weather (for example, wildfires, dust storms) intensify air pollution. Traditional interventions may falter under worsening climate conditions, requiring integrated mitigation, adaptation and resilient infrastructure to yield environmental and health benefits. In this narrative Review, we evaluate multilevel interventions at the national, community and individual levels, discussing what works and does not work, with illustrative case examples. No single intervention suffices; efficacy depends on context, shaped by enforcement and equity. Integrated strategies are needed to address the root causes of air pollution and mitigate the devastating health impacts.

TI  - Contrasting effects of male immigration and rainfall on rank-related patterns of miscarriage in female olive baboons
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - In mammalian species with prolonged maternal investment in which high-ranking males gain disproportionate numbers of mating opportunities, males that quickly ascend the hierarchy may benefit from eliminating the dependent offspring of their competitors. In savanna baboons, high-ranking females are the most profitable targets of infanticide or feticide, because their offspring have higher survival rates and their daughters reach sexual maturity at a younger age. However, such patterns may be obscured by environmental stressors that are known to exacerbate fetal losses, especially in lower-ranking females. Using 30 years of data on wild olive baboons (Papio anubis) in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, we found evidence that rapidly-rising immigrant males induced miscarriages in high-ranking females outside of drought conditions. However, miscarriage rates were largely reversed during prolonged periods of low rainfall, suggesting that low-ranking females are particularly vulnerable to low food availability and social instability. Infanticide did not emerge as a recurrent male strategy in this population, likely because of the protective behavior of resident males towards vulnerable juveniles.

AB  - Mobile apps have been developed for monitoring health and wellness for various reasons such as self-management of chronic diseases, weight loss and maintain healthy life style. As consumers, patients are flooded with new mobile apps and are unaware if they are suitable for desired health and wellness outcomes. As much as a clinician would like to support a patient centered approach and promote mobile wellness apps, the clinicians are unable to guide their patients with new technologies such as mobile wellness apps. Reviews of apps do not have specific guidelines to follow and as new improved apps are introduced previous reviews get obsolete. Hence a framework of guidelines is necessary for clinicians to help their patients to choose the right apps for self-management of disease or general healthy wellbeing.

AB  - Populations of African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana) have been declining due to poaching, human-elephant conflict, and habitat loss. Understanding the causes of these declines could aid in stabilizing elephant populations. We used data from the Great Elephant Census, a 19-country aerial survey of savannah elephants conducted in 2014 and 2015, to examine effects of a suite of variables on elephant mortality. Independent variables included spatially explicit measures of natural processes and human presence as well as country-level socioeconomic measures. Our dependent variable was the carcass ratio, the ratio of dead elephants to live plus dead elephants, which is an index of recent elephant mortality. Carcass ratios are inversely proportional to population growth rates of elephants over the 4 yr prior to a survey. At the scale of survey strata (n = 275, median area = 1,222 km(2)), we found strong negative associations for carcass ratios with vegetation greenness at the time of the survey, overseas development aid to the country, and distance to the nearest international border. At the scale of ecosystems (n = 42, median area = 12,085 km(2)), carcass ratios increased with drought frequency and decreased with human density and overseas development aid to the country. Both stratum- and ecosystem-scale models explained well under one-half of the variance in carcass ratios. The differences in results between scales suggest that the drivers of mortality may be scale-specific and that the corresponding solutions may vary by scale as well.

AB  - Emergency nursing in Gaza's war zone presents innumerable challenges when caring for female patients in a depleted health care system. Negative health outcomes specifically impact women of all ages due to lack of access to menstrual products, prenatal and primary care, private bathrooms, medication, essential nutrition, and clean water. The massive destruction of infrastructure and consequent internal displacement of millions has led to a rise in infectious diseases. The few remaining functional hospitals depend heavily on foreign medical delegations for supplies, which results in a lack of standardized treatment for women's health complaints. Emergency departments must also navigate overcrowding, lack of basic supplies and specialists, and prioritization of daily mass casualty incidents from nearby explosions. These obstacles make treatment, discharge teaching, and follow-up care for women's health difficult to implement. Despite these arduous circumstances, Gazan health care professionals find innovative solutions to improve outcomes and reduce harm while honoring the cultural and religious preferences of their female patients.

AB  - Background: Gestational diabetes insipidus (GDI) is a rare endocrine complication during pregnancy that is associated with vasopressinase overproduction from the placenta. Although increased vasopressinase is associated with placental volume, the regulation of placental growth in the later stage of pregnancy is not well known.
   Case presentation: A 16-year-old pregnant woman was urgently transferred to our hospital because of threatened premature labor when the Kumamoto earthquakes hit the area where she lived. During her hospitalization, she complained of gradually increasing symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia. The serum level of arginine vasopressin (AVP) was 1.7 pg/mL, which is inconsistent with central DI. The challenge of diagnostic treatment using oral 1-deamino-8-D-AVP (DDAVP) successfully controlled her urine and allowed for normal delivery. DDAVP tablets were not necessary to control her polyuria thereafter. Based on these observations, clinical diagnosis of GDI was confirmed. Pathophysiological analyses revealed that vasopressinase expression was more abundant in the GDI patient's syncytiotrophoblast in placenta compared with that in a control subject. Serum vasopressinase was also observed during gestation and disappeared soon after delivery. Vasopressinase is reportedly identical to oxytocinase or insulin regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), which is an abundant cargo protein associated with the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) storage vesicle. Interestingly, the expression and subcellular localization of GLUT4 appeared to occur in a vasopressinase (IRAP)-dependent manner.
   Conclusion: Because placental volume may be associated with vasopressinase overproduction in GDI, vasopressinase (IRAP)/GLUT4 association appears to contribute to the growth of placenta in this case.

AB  - When addressing climate change-associated health effects in children, much of the existing literature has focused on heat exposure. The role dust, drought, wetland desiccation (exposed lakebeds), and wind may have on health has been discussed less frequently. Many of these exposures affect children in rural populations who traditionally have fewer resources and healthcare options available to them. Some of the same children also belong to marginalized groups, ethnic minorities, or have pre-existing lung health issues, and often experience health disparities. In this overview, we discuss how these exposures along with social conditions and genetic susceptibility can affect children's health in the American West, considering: dusty conditions and coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever), exposed lakebeds and lung health, environmental factors and Kawasaki disease (KD), and dust events and motor vehicle accidents. With this summary, which utilizes a multifactorial approach, we stress further research could confirm current findings in other regions of the American West in addition to California, identify more vulnerable subgroups, and inform better policy. Considering exposures other than heat in a broader, more holistic perspective can more fully and equitably address climate change and children's health, setting the stage for a better health trajectory throughout the life course, especially in rural and tribal populations.

AB  - P> Human sex ratio at birth at the population level has been suggested to vary according to exogenous stressors such as wars, ambient temperature, ecological disasters and economic crises, but their relative effects on birth sex ratio have not been investigated. It also remains unclear whether such associations represent environmental forcing or adaptive parental response, as parents may produce the sex that has better survival prospects and fitness in a given environmental challenge.
   We examined the simultaneous role of wars, famine, ambient temperature, economic development and total mortality rate on the annual variation of offspring birth sex ratio and whether this variation, in turn, was related to sex-specific infant mortality rate in Finland during 1865-2003.
   Our findings show an increased excess of male births during the World War II and during warm years. Instead, economic development, famine, short-lasting Finnish civil war and total mortality rate were not related to birth sex ratio. Moreover, we found no association between annual birth sex ratio and sex-biased infant mortality rate among the concurrent cohort.
   Our results propose that some exogenous challenges like ambient temperature and war can skew human birth sex ratio and that these deviations likely represent environmental forcing rather than adaptive parental response to such challenges.

AB  - Climate change, wildfires, and environmental justice concerns have drawn increased attention to the impact of air pollution on children's health and development. Children are especially vulnerable to air pollution exposure, as their brains and bodies are still developing. The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize available empirical evidence on the associations between air pollution exposure and brain outcomes in developmental samples (ages 0-18 years old). Studies were identified by searching the PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection databases and underwent a two-phase screening process before inclusion. 40 studies were included in the review, which included measures of air pollution and brain outcomes at various points in development. Results linked air pollution to varied brain outcomes, including structural volumetric and cortical thickness differences, alterations in white matter microstructure, functional network changes, metabolic and molecular effects, as well as tumor incidence. Few studies included longitudinal changes in brain outcomes. This review also suggests methodologies for incorporating air pollution measures in developmental cognitive neuroscience studies and provides specific policy recommendations to reduce air pollution exposure and promote healthy brain development by improving access to clean air.

AB  - The impact of stress on brain health begins in the womb. Both animal and human studies have found that prenatal maternal stress affects the brain and behavior of the offspring. Stressful life events, exposure to a natural disaster, and symptoms of maternal anxiety and depression increase the risk for the child having a range of emotional, behavioral and/or cognitive problems in later life. These include depression, anxiety, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and/or conduct disorders. There is an increased risk for other outcomes also, including preterm delivery and reduced telomere length, possibly indicative of an accelerated life history. The causal role of prenatal maternal stress on the etiology of the neurodevelopmental disorders is supported by large population cohorts, which have controlled for a wide range of potential confounders, including postnatal maternal mood. More recently, research has begun to explore the biological correlates and mediators of these findings. These studies suggest that the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis plays a role inmediating the effects of maternal stress on the fetal brain. Further, in vivo brain imaging research reports that maternal stress is associated with changes in limbic and frontotemporal networks, and the functional and microstructural connections linking them. The structural changes include cortical thinning and an enlarged amygdala. While these studies have been conducted on smaller sample sizes and could not control for many confounders, the observed brain changes do plausibly underlie many of the emotional, behavioral and cognitive changes found to be associated with prenatal stress.

AB  - Herders in Inner Mongolia experienced two completely different political periods during their last nomadic period between 1961 and 1986. However, climate and technical factors were very similar between these two periods according to statistical analyses. We retrieved historical climate and livestock population data and performed a retrospective study using generalized additive models to analyze three major livestock population demographic metrics changes between these two periods. We found that the sociopolitical factors significantly impacted all three major demographic metrics (adult mortality, neonatal mortality and birthrate) between the two periods for both large (cattle, horse, and camel) and small livestock (sheep and goat). We also identified the interaction effects between sociopolitical factor and climate factors for adult and neonatal mortality, while birthrate was not affected by these interactions. When exposed to climate hazards, adult and neonatal livestock mortality rates were significantly higher, while birthrate was significantly lower in social movement period than in peaceful period. We concluded that political movements had indeed increased the vulnerability of herders' livestock to climate hazards. External political pressures deprived hazard-resistance entitlements of herders, which may explain the elevated effects of political pressures on livestock vulnerability.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities contribute to global warming. Despite global efforts to limit temperature rise, recent data show temperature targets continue to be exceeded. Furthermore, human activities have substantially increased the number of chemicals in our environment. These chemicals can both exacerbate global warming, and their toxicity can be impacted by a warming climate. This paper explores how rising temperatures and increased exposure to chemical pollutants interact to amplify adverse health outcomes. We examine the synergistic effects of environmental stressors, focusing on air pollution and extreme weather events. Additionally, we highlight how these environmental threats disproportionately affect socially and economically disadvantaged communities, exacerbating existing health disparities. By integrating insights on climate change, pollution, and social inequities, we aim to underscore the importance of understanding the compounding effects of climate change on human health. This understanding will facilitate a holistic approach essential for creating informed policies and interventions that protect both the environment and human health.

AB  - Background: The secondary sex ratio (i.e., the odds of a male birth) reportedly declines following natural disasters, pollution events, and economic collapse. It remains unclear whether this decline results from an excess of male fetal loss or reduced male conceptions. The literature also does not converge as to whether the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 induced "communal bereavement", or the widespread feeling of distress among persons who never met those directly involved in the attacks. We test the communal bereavement hypothesis among gravid women by examining whether male fetal deaths rose above expected levels in the US following September 11, 2001.
   Methods: We apply interrupted time-series methods to all fetal deaths at or greater than the 20(th) week of gestation in the US from 1996 to 2002. Time-series methods control for trends, seasonality, and other forms of autocorrelation that could induce spurious associations.
   Results: Results support the hypothesis in that the fetal death sex ratio (i.e., the odds of a male fetal death) increased above its expected value in September 2001. Additional analysis of the secondary sex ratio indirectly supports that the terrorist attacks may have threatened the gestation of male more than female fetuses.
   Conclusions: Societal responses to events such as September 11, 2001 do not appear confined only to persons who have ever met the deceased. The fetal death sex ratio in the US population may serve as a sentinel indicator of the degree to which pregnant women react to population stressors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early menarcheal age is a risk factor for breast and ovarian cancers and is also associated with an increased spontaneous abortion rate. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a link between early menarcheal age and the offspring sex ratio.
   METHODS: We recorded the sex of 21 208 live born infants, all singletons, born to 10 847 premenopausal women (mean attending age: 37.5 +/- 7.2 years, range 22-54) who attended our clinics for obstetrical and gynaecological assessment. We calculated the sex ratio of newborn infants in relation to the mothers' age of menarche (from 9 to 18 years) and to the number of infants per woman (i.e. fertility index).
   RESULTS: A low offspring sex ratio (males/females) of 0.800 was observed in mothers who entered menarche at the age of 9 years; the odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence intervals) compared with those of control group with menarche at age 14 was 0.72 (0.29-1.79). The sex ratio remained low, until the group of mothers who entered menarche at 12 years of age [1.009; OR: 0.90 (0.85-0.95)]. The highest sex ratio was observed in mothers with a menarcheal age of 14 years (1.118; OR: 1.00 control) and it gradually decreased until the menarcheal age of 17 years [1.000; OR: 0.89 (0.15-5.26)]. The fertility index was also low in women with menarche at the age of 9 to 11 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Women entering menarche outside the normal range, especially those with earlier menarche, may have an increased chance of producing female offspring.

AB  - Therapeutic fetal surgical procedures are predicated upon the ability to make an accurate fetal diagnosis. The earliest open fetal surgical procedures were introduced in the 1960s to treat Rh isoimmunisation. They were introduced when it became possible to predict impending fetal demise. Open procedures were abandoned when percutaneous approaches proved superior. The introduction of fetal ultrasound allowed the diagnosis of other congenital anomalies, some being amenable to fetal interventions. Open fetal surgical procedures were initially utilised, with significant maternal morbidity. For some anomalies, percutaneous approaches became favoured. In general, all of these procedures involved significant risks to the mother, to save a baby that was likely to die before or shortly after birth without fetal intervention. Fetal repair for myelomeningocele was a "sea change" in approach. The same maternal risks were taken to improve the quality of life of the affected fetus, not save its life. The completion of the "MOMs Trial" has occasioned a "tsunami" of centres in North America applying this approach. Others are attempting percutaneous repairs, with mixed results. This paper reviews the history of fetal surgery, focusing on the themes of the tension between accurate diagnosis and prognosis and open versus "minimally invasive" approaches.

AB  - The secondary sex ratio (SSR) has been suggested to decrease with adverse physical and psychological environments. Previous studies have focused on reduced SSR under adverse conditions, such as war, terrorism attack and earthquake, but few studies have investigated fluctuations in SSR in moderately adverse environments. This study analysed municipality-level vital statistics records in Japan collected between 1998 and 2002 to identify high-SSR clusters and low-SSR clusters with spatial-scan statistics. In 999 runs of simulation, high-and low-SSR clusters were detected but fewer than 950 times, indicating that SSR was not geographically clustered in Japan if type I error of 5% was adopted. Explorative analyses comparing demographic attributes between high-SSR clusters and low-SSR clusters that were detected more than 500 times in 999 runs of simulation, showed that rate of spontaneous abortion, rate of artificial abortion and divorce rate were higher in low-SSR clusters, while male life expectancy, female life expectancy and total fertility rate were higher in a high-SSR cluster.

AB  - Objective To examine countries'engagement with the health impacts of climate change in their formal statements to intergovernmental organizations, and the factors driving engagement.
   Methods We obtained the texts of countries'annual statements in United Nations (UN) general debates from 2000 to 2019 and their nationally determined contributions at the Paris Agreement in 2016. To measure countries' engagement, we used a keyword-in-context text search with relevant search terms to count the total number of references to the relationship of health to climate change. We used a machine learning model (random forest predictions) to identify the most important country-level predictors of engagement. The predictors included political and economic factors, health outcomes, climate change-related variables and membership of political negotiating groups in the UN.
   Findings For both UN general debate statements and nationally determined contributions, low-and middle-income countries discussed the health impacts of climate change much more than did high-income countries. The most important predictors of engagement were health outcomes (infant mortality, maternal deaths, life expectancy), countries' income levels (gross domestic product per capita), and fossil fuel consumption. Membership of political negotiating groups (such as the Group of 77 and Small Island Developing States) was a less important predictor.
   Conclusion Our analysis indicated a higher engagement in countries that carry the heaviest climate-related health burdens, but lack necessary resources to address the impacts of climate change. These countries are shouldering responsibility for reminding the global community of the implications of climate change for people's health.
   Climate change is taking an increasing toll on people's health. The increase in heatwaves, drought, floods and other climate hazards is increasing the risk of climate-related illness and death as well as reversing gains made in reducing food insecurity and global hunger.1,2 Air pollution, primarily driven by fossil fuel emissions, is the major environmental risk factor for premature death and has impacts on child health and survival.3-5 Highlighting these human impacts is seen as a way of accelerating climate action,

AB  - Background Climate change represents a fundamental threat to human health, with pregnant women and newborns being more susceptible than other populations. In this review, we aimed to describe the current landscape of available epidemiological evidence on key climate risks on maternal and newborn health (MNH). Methods We sought to identify published systematic and scoping reviews investigating the impact of different climate hazards and air pollution on MNH outcomes. With this in mind, we developed a systematic search strategy based on the concepts of 'climate/air pollution hazards, 'maternal health,' and 'newborn health,' with restrictions to reviews published between 1 January 2010 and 6 February 2023, but without geographical or language restriction. Following full text screening and data extraction, we synthesised the results using narrative synthesis. Results We found 79 reviews investigating the effects of climate hazards on MNH, mainly focussing on outdoor air pollution (n = 47, 59%), heat (n = 24, 30%), and flood/ storm disasters (n = 7, 9%). Most were published after 2015 (n = 60, 76%). These reviews had consistent findings regarding the positive association of exposure to heat and to air pollution with adverse birth outcomes, particularly preterm birth. We found limited evidence for impacts of climate-related food and water security on MNH and did not identify any reviews on climate-sensitive infectious diseases and MNH. Conclusions Climate change could undermine recent improvements in maternal and newborn health. Our review provides an overview of key climate risks to MNH. It could therefore be useful to the MNH community to better understand the MNH needs for each climate hazard and to strengthen discussions on evidence and research gaps and potential actions. Despite the lack of comprehensive evidence for some climate hazards and for many maternal, perinatal, and newborn outcomes, we observed repeated findings of the impact of heat and air pollutants on birth outcomes, particularly preterm birth. It is time for policy dialogue to follow to specifically design climate policy and actions to protect the needs of MNH.

AB  - This study estimates the impact of weather shocks on educational outcomes in Colombian municipalities and explores the main transmission mechanisms. We employ a panel data set combining information on municipal weather shocks, educational results, and socioeconomic characteristics for 2010-2016. Linear regression models are estimated using fixed effects and robust standard errors at the municipal level, followed by mediation analyses. Results indicate that excess rainfall shocks increase school dropout and decrease coverage rates and academic performance while deficit rainfall shocks have the opposite effect on all outcomes. The main mechanisms explaining these results are income, as proxied by tax revenues, intergovernmental transfers, and agricultural income, and the infant mortality rate.

AB  - Background: In a post-war frontier area in north-western Nicaragua that was severely hit by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, local stakeholders embarked on and facilitated multi-dimensional development initiatives to break the cycles of poverty.
   Objective: The aim of this paper is to describe the process of priority-setting, and the strategies, guiding principles, activities, achievements, and lessons learned in these local development efforts from 1990 to 2014 in the Cuatro Santos area, Nicaragua. Methods: Data were derived from project records and a Health and Demographic Surveillance System that was initiated in 2004. The area had 25,893 inhabitants living in 5,966 households in 2014.
   Results: A participatory process with local stakeholders and community representatives resulted in a long-term strategic plan. Guiding principles were local ownership, political reconciliation, consensus decision-making, social and gender equity, an environmental and public health perspective, and sustainability. Local data were used in workshops with communities to re-prioritise and formulate new goals. The interventions included water and sanitation, house construction, microcredits, environmental protection, school breakfasts, technical training, university scholarships, home gardening, breastfeeding promotion, and maternity waiting homes. During the last decade, the proportion of individuals living in poverty was reduced from 79 to 47%. Primary school enrolment increased from 70 to 98% after the start of the school breakfast program. Under-five mortality was around 50 per 1,000 live births in 1990 and again peaked after Hurricane Mitch and was approaching 20 per 1,000 in 2014. Several of the interventions have been scaled up as national programs.
   Conclusions: The lessons learned from the Cuatro Santos initiative underline the importance of a bottom- up approach and local ownership of the development process, the value of local data for monitoring and evaluation, and the need for multi-dimensional local interventions to break the cycles of poverty and gain better health and welfare.

AB  - High fertility and population growth have been framed as villains in global health and development. Inspired by neo-Malthusian concerns around resource depletion, scholars have argued that fertility reduction through increased contraceptive use is necessary to protect maternal health, prevent environmental disaster, and promote economic prosperity throughout the Global South. Despite substantial critique from feminist and anticolonial scholars, the scientific evidence behind these arguments has often been treated as established fact. This ostensible scientific consensus on the instrumental benefits of contraceptive use has been marshalled by the global family planning establishment in the wake of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development to justify continued efforts to maximize contraceptive uptake in the Global South. Here, we critically examine the evidence linking high fertility to adverse maternal health, environmental, and economic outcomes and evaluate whether reducing fertility through increased contraceptive use offers an effective strategy to address these challenges. We find the state of the evidence weaker and more conflicted than commonly acknowledged, with many claims relying on small effect sizes and/or unjustified assumptions. While increasing contraceptive uptake and reducing fertility may offer limited, marginal advantages, we argue that family planning cannot effectively address the multidimensional challenges of global poverty, ill health, and environmental degradation. Instead, global health and development should address root causes of these phenomena, while family planning programs must radically refocus on reproductive autonomy.

AB  - The genetics and the epidemiology of Down syndrome (DS) was studied in the area which is covered by our registry of congenital malformations. For each of the 398 neu DS cases which were ascertained during the period 1979 to 1996 more than 50 factors were studied and compared to those from control infants. The prevalence of DS was 1.66 per 1000; 2.2% of the DS cases were stillbirths and 29.4% were induced abortions. Karyotypes were obtained in 391 cases of which all but 23 were 47,+21;9 were mosaics (2.3%), and 14 had translocations (3.6%). Interchromosomal effect was a question in 7 cases. The most common types of associated malformations were cardiac anomalies (46.2%) and intestinal atresias (6.0%). Seasonality or time/space clusters were not observed in spite of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. No paternal age effect was demonstrated; 5.3% of the mothers of DS had 2 previous spontaneous abortions (controls 3.7%, p < 0.05). At birth, the DS infants measured and weighted less and their head circumference was lower than in control infants, Weight of placenta was also lower than in control infants, In this material there were 4.5% of consanguineous marriages (P < 0.01). The pregnancies of the DS children were more often complicated by threatened abortions than in the controls, 3.2% of the mothers of the DS children were diabetic controls (1.7%), although the difference was not statistically significant. For all other factors studied no statistically significant difference with respect to controls could be demonstrated.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic's profound impacts on global health, driven by preparedness gaps and systemic risks, underscore the need to enhance societies' ability to manage both predictable risks and uncertainties inherent in disasters. While disaster research emphasises risk management for predictable threats and adaptive capacity for unexpected challenges, there is a lack of empirical examination of the impact of adaptive capacity on disaster resilience. This study addresses this gap by identifying three key adaptive capacities - quality of institutions, collaborative governance, and social capital - and examining their effects on COVID-19 resilience outcomes, measured by the ability to reduce excess mortality. Analysing secondary data from 129 nations using partial least squares structural equation modelling, the research finds significant positive effects of institutional quality and social capital on resilience outcomes. Conversely, collaborative governance shows a significant negative association, suggesting potentially intricate impacts beyond initial expectations. The findings highlight the need to enhance institutional quality and social capital to address preparedness gaps and unexpected challenges posed by biological hazards such as COVID-19. Future research should explore collaborative governance using a disaggregated approach that considers the roles of different stakeholders in various disaster phases. Contribution: This study advances disaster research by presenting practical methodologies for operationalising adaptive capacities and empirically examining their effects on disaster resilience. For practitioners and policymakers, it highlights the need to adopt a long-term perspective in building disaster resilience, focussing on improving institutional quality and social capital to manage the uncertainties and complexities inherent in disaster scenarios effectively.

AB  - The Chernobyl nuclear accident happened in the former Soviet Union oil 26 April 1986. The accident destroyed one of the RBMK-1000 type reactors and released significant radioactive contamination into the environment. At first the emissions were transported north-westwards over Poland, the Baltic States, Finland, Sweden and Norway. During 27 April 1986 emissions were spreading to eastern-central Europe, southern Germany, Italy and Yugoslavia. Radioactivity mapping over Finland between 29 April and 16 May 1986 showed that the ground deposition in Finland covered southern and central parts of the country but had an irregular distribution. The highest (over 100 mu R h(-1) [1 mu Sv h(-1)]) contamination disclosed by the mapping was around the city of Uusikaupunki in western Finland and the city of Kotka in southeastern Finland. The Uusikaupunki region was an area of heavy fallout associated with the air mass that was located in the Chernobyl area at the time of the accident. The fallout pattern of reftractory nuclides, e.g. plutonium isotopes, had their spatial maximum in this region. Medical consequences in Finland were luckily mild, the most important symptoms being psychological ones. No increase in thyroid cancer or birth defect occurrence has been observed. The Chernobyl accident boosted the radioecological research which had already been calming down after the last atmospheric nuclear test in China in October 1980. Important new results concerning e.g. hot particles have been achieved. The most important effects of the accident in Finland were, however, the increase of public awareness of environmental issues in general and especially of nuclear energy. In Finland, the nuclear energy programme was halted until 2002 when the Parliament of Finland granted a licence to build the fifth nuclear reactor in Finland.

AB  - Current accelerated tests of photovoltaic (PV) modules mostly prevent infant mortality but cannot duplicate changes occurring in the field nor can predict useful lifetime. Therefore, monitoring of field-deployed PV modules was undertaken at FSEC with goals to assess their performance in hot and humid climate under high voltage operation and to correlate the PV performance with the meteorological parameters. This paper presents performance analysis of U.S. Company manufactured thin film a-Si:H PV modules that are encapsulated using flexible front sheets and framed to be outdoor tested. Statistical data analysis of PV parameters along with meteorological parameters, monitored continuously, is carried out on regular basis with PVUSA type regression analysis. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of module arrays that are obtained periodically complement the continuous data monitoring. Moreover, effect of high voltage bias and ambient parameters on leakage current in PV modules on individual modules is studied. Any degradation occurring during initial 18 months could not be assessed due to data acquisition and hurricane problems. No significant degradation was observed in the performance of PV modules during the subsequent 30-months. It is planned to continue this study for a prolonged period so as to serve as basis for their long-term warranties.

AB  - Recordings from infants who died suddenly and unexpectedly demonstrate the occurrence of recurring apneas, ineffective gasping, and finally, failure to restore eupnea and arouse prior to death. Immunohistochemical and autoradiographic data demonstrate a constellation of serotonergic defects in the caudal raphe nuclei in infants who died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The purpose of this review is to synthesize what is known about adaptive responses of the infant to severely hypoxic conditions, which unleash a flood of neuromodulators that inhibit cardiorespiratory function, thermogenesis, and arousal and the emerging role of serotonin, which combats this cardiorespiratory inhibition to foster autoresuscitation, eupnea, and arousal to ensure survival following an hypoxic episode. The laryngeal and carotid body chemoreflexes are potent in newborns and infants, and both reflexes can induce apnea and bradycardia, which may be adaptive initially, but must be terminated if an infant is to survive. Serotonin has a unique ability to touch on each of the processes that may be required to recover from hypoxic reflex apnea: gasping, the restoration of heart rate and blood pressure, termination of apneas and, eventually, stimulation of eupnea and arousal. Recurrent apneic events, bradycardia, ineffective gasping and a failure to terminate apneas and restore eupnea are observed in animals harboring defects in the caudal serotonergic system models - all of these phenotypes are reminiscent of and compatible with the cardiorespiratory recordings made in infants who subsequently died of SIDS. The caudal serotonergic system provides an organized, multi-pronged defense against reflex cardiorespiratory inhibition and the hypoxia that accompanies prolonged apnea, bradycardia and hypotension, and any deficiency of caudal serotonergic function will increase the propensity for sudden unexplained infant death.

AB  - Transition metal and nitrogen co-decorated carbon materials are promising platforms for CO2 electroreduction. A hard-template 2-step pyrolysis method is proposed for the fabrication of highly dispersed Ni and Cu atomic active sites on a 3D macroporous carbon matrix. The pyrrolic N-type Ni-N-x sites serve as dominant active sites toward selective CO2 electroreduction to CO. The incorporation of Cu alters the distribution of N species and simultaneously optimizes the electronic state and geometric structure of the Ni-N-x moiety, thereby improving its adsorption and activation capacity for CO2. Moreover, the isolated Cu atomic sites enhance the resistance of corresponding gas-diffusion electrodes against electrolyte flooding. The optimal catalyst 3D NiCu-69 achieves nearly exclusive production of CO with a Faraday efficiency (FECO) of 98% at a current density of -700 mA cm(-2) in a CO2-gas-fed flow-through electrolyzer and delivers a CO production rate of 1363 mol(m(2)s)(-1), which is exceeding most reported electrocatalysts. The FECO remained as high as 94% after electrolyzing at a current density of -100 mA cm(-2) for 22 h. 3D NiCu-69 exhibits a favorable performance in both acidic and neutral conditions, with a high FECO of approximate to 90.2% within the current density range of -100 to -500 mA cm(-2).

Effects of continuity of care by a primary midwife (caseload midwifery) on caesarean section rates in women of low obstetric risk: the COSMOS randomised controlled trial. BJOG 2012;119:14831492. Objective To determine whether primary midwife care (caseload midwifery) decreases the caesarean section rate compared with standard maternity care. Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting Tertiary-care womens hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Population A total of 2314 low-risk pregnant women. Methods Women randomised to caseload received antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care from a primary midwife with some care by back-up midwives. Women randomised to standard care received either midwifery or obstetric-trainee care with varying levels of continuity, or community-based general practitioner care. Main outcome measures Primary outcome: caesarean birth. Secondary outcomes included instrumental vaginal births, analgesia, perineal trauma, induction of labour, infant admission to special/neonatal intensive care, gestational age, Apgar scores and birthweight. Results In total 2314 women were randomised1156 to caseload and 1158 to standard care. Women allocated to caseload were less likely to have a caesarean section (19.4% versus 24.9%; risk ratio [RR] 0.78; 95% CI 0.670.91; P = 0.001); more likely to have a spontaneous vaginal birth (63.0% versus 55.7%; RR 1.13; 95% CI 1.061.21; P < 0.001); less likely to have epidural analgesia (30.5% versus 34.6%; RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.790.996; P = 0.04) and less likely to have an episiotomy (23.1% versus 29.4%; RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.670.92; P = 0.003). Infants of women allocated to caseload were less likely to be admitted to special or neonatal intensive care (4.0% versus 6.4%; RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.440.90; P = 0.01). No infant outcomes favoured standard care. Conclusion In settings with a relatively high baseline caesarean section rate, caseload midwifery for women at low obstetric risk in early pregnancy shows promise for reducing caesarean births.

AB  - Prenatal maternal stress has been shown to impair functioning in nonhuman primate offspring. Little is known about the effects of prenatal stress on intellectual and language development in humans because it is difficult to identify sufficiently large samples of pregnant women who have been exposed to an independent stressor. We took advantage of a natural disaster (January 1998 ice storm in Quebec, Canada) to determine the effect of the objective severity of pregnant women's stress exposure on general intellectual and language development of their children. Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) scores and parent-reported language abilities of 58 toddlers of mothers who were exposed to varying levels of prenatal stress were obtained at 2 y of age. The hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that the toddlers' birth weight and age at testing accounted for 12.0% and 14.8% of the variance in the Bayley MDI scores and in productive language abilities, respectively. More importantly, the level of prenatal stress exposure accounted for an additional 11.4% and 12.1% of the variance in the toddlers' Bayley MDI and productive language abilities and uniquely accounted for 17.3% of the variance of their receptive language abilities. The more severe the level of prenatal stress exposure, the poorer the toddlers' abilities. The level of prenatal stress exposure accounted for a Significant proportion of the variance in the three dependent variables above and beyond that already accounted for by non-ice storm-related factors. We suspect that high levels of prenatal stress exposure, particularly early in the pregnancy, may negatively affect the brain development of the fetus, reflected in the lower general intellectual and language abilities in the toddlers.

AB  - Shallow groundwater is the main source for drinking water in Kabul. It comes from a multitude of shallow hand-pumped wells spread over the whole city area. The groundwater is characterised by slightly oxic redox conditions. Interactions with aquifer carbonates lead to high degrees of hardness and near-neutral pH. The mostly negative water budget of the Kabul basin results in strong evaporation which leads to an increase in salt content and some undesirable constituents, including borate. Several years of drought have aggravated this problem. The shallow groundwater in the city has received tremendous amounts of pollutants due to a lack of proper waste and wastewater disposal. Common indicators are elevated concentrations of nutrients such as nitrate and faecal bacteria. The high infant mortality can at least partially be attributed to insufficient water hygiene. Acid generated during the mineralization of the waste water is hidden due to the strong pH buffering capacity. Redox and pH conditions preclude significant mobilisation of trace metals and metalloids.

AB  - At the beginning of 2020, the Italian Lombardy region was hit by an "epidemic tsunami" which was, at that point in time, one of the worst pandemics ever. At that moment the effects of SARS-COV 2 were still unknown. To evaluate whether the pandemic has influenced ART (Assisted Reproduction Techniques) outcomes in an asymptomatic infertile population treated at one of the major COVID-19 epicentres during the weeks immediately preceding lockdown. All ART procedures performed during two time periods were compared: November 1st, 2018 to February 28th, 2019 (non-COVID-19 risk) and November 1st, 2019 to February 29th, 2020 (COVID-19 risk). In total 1749 fresh cycles (883 non-COVID-19 risk and 866 COVID-19 risk) and1166 embryos and 63 oocytes warming cycles (538 and 37 during non-COVID and 628 and 26 during COVID-19 risk, respectively) were analysed. Clinical pregnancies per cycle were not different: 370 (25.38%) in non-COVID versus 415 (27.30%) (p = 0.237) during COVID-19 risk. There were no differences in biochemical pregnancy rates 52 (3.57%) versus 38 (2.50%) (p = 0.089) nor in ectopic pregnancies 4 (1.08%) versus 3 (0.72%) (p = 0.594), spontaneous miscarriages 84 (22.70%) versus 103 (24.82%) p = 0.487, nor in intrauterine ongoing pregnancies 282 (76.22%) versus 309 (74.46%) p = 0.569. A multivariate analysis investigating differences in spontaneous miscarriage rate showed no differences between the two timeframes. Our results support no differences in asymptomatic infertile couples' ART outcomes between the pre COVID and COVID-19 periods in one of the earliest and most severe pandemic areas.

AB  - The Svalbard Archipelago represents the northernmost place on Earth where cryospheric hazards, such as thaw slumps (TSs) and thermo-erosion gullies (TEGs) could take place and rapidly develop under the influence of climatic variations. Svalbard permafrost is specifically sensitive to rapidly occurring warming, and therefore, a deeper understanding of TSs and TEGs is necessary to understand and foresee the dynamics behind local cryospheric hazards' occurrences and their global implications. We present the latest update of two polygonal inventories where the extent of TSs and TEGs is recorded across Nordenskiold Land (Svalbard Archipelago), over a surface of approximately 4000 km2. This area was chosen because it represents the most concentrated ice-free area of the Svalbard Archipelago and, at the same time, where most of the current human settlements are concentrated. The inventories were created through the visual interpretation of high-resolution aerial photographs as part of our ongoing effort toward creating a pan-Arctic repository of TSs and TEGs. Overall, we mapped 562 TSs and 908 TEGs, from which we separately generated two susceptibility maps using a generalised additive model (GAM) approach, under the assumption that TSs and TEGs manifest across Nordenskiold Land, according to a Bernoulli probability distribution. Once the modelling results were validated, the two susceptibility patterns were combined into the first multi-hazard cryospheric susceptibility map of the area. The two inventories are available at (Nicu et al., 2022a) and (Nicu et al., 2022b).

AB  - The health sector component of the first U.S. National Assessment, published in 2000, synthesized the anticipated health impacts of climate variability and change for five categories of health outcomes: impacts attributable to temperature, extreme weather events (e.g., storms and floods), air pollution, water- and food-borne diseases, and vector- and rodent-borne diseases. The Health Sector Assessment (HSA) concluded that climate variability and change are likely to increase morbidity and mortality risks for several climate-sensitive health outcomes, with the net impact uncertain. The objective of this study was to update the first HSA based on recent publications that address the potential impacts of climate variability and change in the United States for the five health outcome categories. The literature published since the first HSA supports the initial conclusions, with new data refining quantitative exposure-response relationships for several health end points, particularly for extreme heat events and air pollution. The United States continues to have a very high capacity to plan for and respond to climate change, although relatively little progress has been noted in the literature on implementing adaptive strategies and measures. Large knowledge gaps remain, resulting in a substantial need for additional research to improve our understanding of how weather and climate, both directly and indirectly, can influence human health. Filling these knowledge gaps will help better define the potential health impacts of climate change and identify specific public health adaptations to increase resilience.

AB  - Background The World Health Organization recommends that newborn infants be breastfed within the first hour of life, a practice that improves infant health and reduces neonatal mortality. The objectives of this study were to report the rate of breastfeeding initiation within 1hour of birth in Jiangyou, China, to determine its impact on full breastfeeding at discharge, and to investigate factors associated with early breastfeeding initiation. Methods A prospective cohort study of infant feeding practices was undertaken during 2010 and 2011 in Jiangyou, 2years after an earthquake caused extensive damage. A total of 695 mothers were recruited from hospitals and health centers and interviewed at discharge. Results In this study, 9.1 percent of women began breastfeeding within 1hour postpartum. Mothers who initiated breastfeeding early were more likely to be fully breastfeeding at discharge (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.23-3.60). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that giving birth at a health center was associated with delayed breastfeeding initiation (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.04-0.32), whereas attending antenatal classes (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.36-4.87) and receiving encouragement from hospital staff to initiate breastfeeding (OR 5.60, 95% CI 2.31-13.55) were correlated with putting the baby to the breast soon after delivery. Conclusions Early breastfeeding initiation rate was low and the use of prelacteal foods was widespread in Jiangyou. Early breastfeeding initiation was associated with higher full breastfeeding rates at discharge. It is important to educate doctors and nurses to assist mothers with early breastfeeding initiation and to discourage the use of non-breastmilk prelacteal feeds. (BIRTH 40:2 June 2013)

AB  - Although many studies have examined broad patterns of effects on pregnancy and infant outcomes after disasters, the causes of adverse outcomes are not always clear. Disasters cause interrelated exposure to environmental pollutants, psychological stressors, and lack of health care, and interacts with other social determinants of health. This topical review examines the short- and long-term effects of disasters on pregnancy and how they are mediated by social, behavioral, and environmental effects. In the short term, disasters are associated with physical trauma, adverse environmental exposures, and unstable housing. In the longer term, disasters may lead to relocation, changes in family functioning, and negative economic effects. These aspects of disaster exposure, in turn, lead to lack of access to health care, increased stress and negative mental health outcomes, and negative behavioral changes, including smoking and substance use, poor nutrition, physical overexertion and limited activity, and reduction in breastfeeding. All of these factors interact with social determinants of health to worsen effects on the most vulnerable women, infants, and communities. Few interventions after disasters have been tested. With the increase in disasters due to climate change and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the models of effects of disasters and their human health consequences need increasing refinement, and, more importantly, should be applied to interventions that improve disaster prevention, mitigation, and response.

AB  - Climate change poses unique challenges to maternal well-being and increases complications during pregnancy and childbirth globally. This evidence gap map (EGM) aims to identify gaps in existing knowledge and areas where further research related to climate change and its impact on maternal health is required. The following databases were searched individually from inception to present: Medline, EMBASE, and Global Health via OVID; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCOhost; Scopus; and organizational websites. In this EGM, we integrated 133 studies published in English, including qualitative, quantitative, reviews and grey literature that examined the impact of climate change on maternal health (women aged 15-45). We used Covidence to screen studies and Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (Eppi reviewer)/Eppi Mapper software to generate the EGM. Data extraction and qualitative appraisal of the studies was done using critical appraisal tools. The study protocol was registered in International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY) # INPLASY202370085. Out of 133 included studies, forty seven studies were of high quality, seventy nine moderate equality and seven low quality. This EGM found notable gaps in the literature regarding the distribution of research across regions. We found significant research in North America (51) and Asia (40 studies). However, Africa and the Caribbean had fewer studies, highlighting potential disparities in research attention and resources. Moreover, while the impact of extreme heat emerged as a prominent factor impacting maternal well-being, there is a need for further investigation into other climate-related factors such as drought. Additionally, while preterm stillbirth and maternal mortality have gained attention, there is an overlook of malnutrition and food insecurity indicators that require attention in future research. The EGM identifies existing research gaps in climate change and maternal health. It emphasizes the need for global collaboration and targeted interventions to address disparities and inform climate- responsive policies.

AB  - Introduction: Surmang, Qinghai Province is a rural nomadic Tibetan region in western China recently devastated by the 2010 Yushu earthquake; little information is available on access and coverage of maternal and child health services.
   Methods: A cross-sectional household survey was conducted in August 2004. 402 women of reproductive age (15-50) were interviewed regarding their pregnancy history, access to and utilization of health care, and infant and child health care practices.
   Results: Women's access to education was low at 15% for any formal schooling; adult female literacy was <20%. One third of women received any antenatal care during their last pregnancy. Institutional delivery and skilled birth attendance were <1%, and there were no reported cesarean deliveries. Birth was commonly attended by a female relative, and 8% of women delivered alone. Use of unsterilized instrument to cut the umbilical cord was nearly universal (94%), while coverage for tetanus toxoid immunization was only 14%. Traditional Tibetan healers were frequently sought for problems during pregnancy (70%), the postpartum period (87%), and for childhood illnesses (74%). Western medicine (61%) was preferred over Tibetan medicine (9%) for preventive antenatal care. The average time to reach a health facility was 4.3 hours. Postpartum infectious morbidity appeared to be high, but only 3% of women with postpartum problems received western medical care. 64% of recently pregnant women reported that they were very worried about dying in childbirth. The community reported 3 maternal deaths and 103 live births in the 19 months prior to the survey.
   Conclusions: While China is on track to achieve national Millennium Development Goal targets for maternal and child health, women and children in Surmang suffer from substantial health inequities in access to antenatal, skilled birth and postpartum care. Institutional delivery, skilled attendance and cesarean delivery are virtually inaccessible, and consequently maternal and infant morbidity and mortality are likely high. Urgent action is needed to improve access to maternal, neonatal and child health care in these marginalized populations. The reconstruction after the recent earthquake provides a unique opportunity to link this population with the health system.

AB  - Exposure to fire smoke has become a global health concern and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. There is a lack of understanding of the specific immune mechanisms involved in smoke exposure, with preventive and targeted interventions needed. After exposure to fire smoke, which includes PM2.5, toxic metals and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, epidemiology-based studies have demonstrated increases in respiratory (for example, asthma exacerbation), cardiac (for example, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias), neurological (for example, stroke) and pregnancy-related (for example, low birthweight, premature birth) outcomes. However, mechanistic studies exploring how smoke exposure disrupts cellular homeostasis are lacking. Therefore, we collected blood from smoke-exposed individuals (n = 31) and age-matched and sex-matched non-smoke-exposed controls (n = 29), and investigated these complex interactions using a single-cell exposomic approach based on both methylation and mass cytometry. Overall, our data demonstrated a strong association between smoke exposure and methylation at 133 disease-relevant gene loci, while immunophenotyping showed increased homing and activation biomarkers. We developed an application of mass cytometry to analyze single-cell/metal binding and found, for example, increased levels of mercury in dead cells and cadmium in the live and dead cell populations. Moreover, mercury levels were associated with years of smoke exposure. Several epigenetic sites across multiple chromosomes were associated with individual toxic metal isotopes in single immune cells. Our methods for detecting the effect of smoke exposure at the single-cell level and the study results may help to determine the timing of exposure and identify specific molecular targets that could be modified to prevent and manage exposure to smoke.

AB  - Author summaryAn Ebola outbreak has been likened to a natural disaster in its devastating impact on child health and nutritional status. The ease of transmission of a disease with a 50% mortality rate for those once infected raises particular challenges for breast-feeding women. This systematic review explored the attitudes and preferences of pregnant women, mothers, family members, health practitioners and policy makers concerning infant feeding during an Ebola epidemic as documented in qualitative studies. Participants reported confusion and inconsistent guidance regarding breast-feeding practice, together with difficulties in conveying recommendations to separate mothers infected with Ebola from their breast-feeding infants. Disruption impacted on access to supplementary and complementary feeds, health systems monitoring child growth and support to child health. Widespread distrust and suspicion of health professionals hindered health care provision. Wider family assumed roles in feeding and caring for young children, within the context of reduced access to nutritious foods and supplementary feeds. The work of humanitarian agencies, while valuable, lacked coordination. Planning for an Ebola outbreak requires advance preparation of health messaging for mothers and caregivers, coordinated provision of complementary feeds and support for families who assume caring responsibilities. Strategies to ensure linked up working between government and humanitarian agencies are essential.
   BackgroundBreast-feeding holds considerable potential to reduce infant mortality. Feeding choices, already complex, take on additional complexity against a backdrop of the risk of transmissible Ebola Virus. This review describes the factors that influence infant feeding and attitudes of pregnant women, mothers, family members and health practitioners, policy makers and providers (midwives) concerning infant feeding when there is a risk of Mother-to-Child (MTC) transmission of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). MethodologyA systematic review of qualitative studies identified through rigorous searches of thirteen online databases and additional citation searches of included studies was undertaken. Search terms included breast-feeding, breast-feeding, infant feeding; Ebola; and qualitative, interview(s) and findings. Independent extraction of data by two reviewers using predefined extraction forms. Studies were assessed using the CASP Qualitative checklist. Principal findings5219 references were screened. 38 references related specifically to Ebola, and five papers met the inclusion criteria with data gathered from two settings: Guinea and Sierra Leone. The EVD outbreak had a significant impact on beliefs, attitudes, and resources to support infant feeding practices negatively affecting the nutritional status of children. The evidence from these studies highlight the need for guidance and appropriate psychosocial support need to be available to mothers who display symptoms and become infected and to front-line staff who are giving advice. Communities need to be engaged because stigma and fear may hinder uptake of appropriate interventions. The EVD outbreak caused multi-level system disruption akin to that seen following a natural disaster, meaning that logistics and coordination are critical and need adequate resourcing. Food production and distribution, and malnutrition screening are also disrupted and thereby compounding compromised nutritional status. The limited number of relevant studies highlights the need for further primary research, particularly in translation of messages to local settings. ConclusionsAn EVD outbreak causes multi-level disruption that negatively impacts infant feeding and child care practices. Negative impacts have multiple causes and successful planning for Ebola outbreaks requires that nutrition of infants and young children is a priority. Lessons from the Ebola pandemic have wider applicability to other pandemic contexts including Covid-19.

AB  - Background The emerging global issue of climate change has large-scale effects on health and well-being, including communication disorders. The broad range of the speech and language therapy profession's scope of practice incorporates prevention, advocacy and equality in service delivery. These act as a springboard for involvement in climate change and health.
   Aims This is an appeal to speech and language therapists (SLTs) to focus and take action on this issue and its considerable effects on communication and swallowing disorders.
   Methods & Procedures This article discusses the importance of taking a public health position on prevention and equality of services to manage environmental determinants of communication and swallowing disorders. It also describes the extent to which climate change affects these disorders and exacerbates the inequality of healthcare services in low- and middle-income countries.
   Main Contribution Five strategies are provided for action on fulfilling therapists' roles in reducing the incidence, development and exacerbation of climate-related communication and swallowing disorders, as well as the role of SLTs in acting as advocates. The case is made for expanding the scope of services to focus on prevention and service equality so as to best meet the needs of the wider community.
   Conclusions & Implications Despite other challenges currently facing SLTs, climate change and its increasing effects on communication disorders and dysphagia is difficult to ignore. SLTs owe it to their clients, the wider community, low- and middle-income countries, the economy, and the future to take action.
   What this paper adds What this paper adds to existing knowledgeWhat is already known on the subject
   What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work?
   Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that climate change is extremely likely to be due to human activities. The global effects will be higher temperatures, changes in precipitation, more droughts and heatwaves, stronger and more intense hurricanes, and a rising sea level which directly threaten the health of entire populations. Other health professions are beginning to take climate change into account in training and practice.
   Many disorders of communication and swallowing are caused or exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Increasing temperatures, extremes of precipitation, population displacement and air pollution contribute to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, respiratory disease, malnutrition, premature birth, air- and water-borne diseases, and mental illness. These may affect the communication and swallowing abilities across the lifespan, but particularly those of children and older adults.
   SLTs' roles in prevention, advocacy and education act as a starting point for involvement in climate change and health. Three practical strategies for action include educating SLTs and other health professionals on climate change and its effects on communication and swallowing, promoting awareness with clients and their families, and gathering and disseminating reliable data.

AB  - Dams are essential for flood protection, water resources management, energy generation and storage and food production. However, the consequences of their failure can be catastrophic, as demonstrated by recent examples. Here this study revisits dam failures worldwide since 1900, analysing key factors driving the failure risk, profiling current dam safety and providing an outlook to the near future. Similar to previous analyses (1970s to 2010s), we observe a strong infant mortality, which remains especially important for the development of new embankment dams, while recent concrete dams have become more resilient. In contrast, hazard signals related to ageing remain yet less apparent, contrary to common belief. Nevertheless, given their abundance, we expect decades-old dams to be prevalent in future failure statistics-especially for embankment dams of height between 15 and 70 m built in the second half of the last century. This highlights the relevance of investments in monitoring, maintenance and uprating, which, if ignored, could become a substantial liability and a major vulnerability, especially in the context of increased flooding frequency. We uncover a trend of increased failure rates of newly constructed dams in low-income regions, which coincides with areas where a substantial hydropower potential remains untapped. This is especially intensified in monsoon-dominated climates, whereas the pattern of construction and failures is more homogeneous across other major climatic regions. Our statistical analysis suggests that 23 (95% confidence interval 14-33) large dam failures are to be expected worldwide in the near future (2023-2035), with currently similar to 4.4% of large dams having a probability of failure larger than 1/10,000. Contrarily, 85% of large dams are at least twice as safe as this threshold, commonly embraced in policy. These findings can support the targeted allocation of limited resources for the future-proofing of infrastructure, thereby contributing to water, food and energy security.

AB  - Identification of large-volume, short-duration mafic magmatic events of intraplate affinity in both continental and oceanic settings on the Earth and other planets provides invaluable clues for understanding several vital geological issues of current concern. Of particular importance is understanding the assembly and dispersal of supercontinents through Earth's history, dramatic climate change events including mass extinctions, and processes that have produced a wide range of large igneous province (LIP)-related resources such as NiCu-PGE, Au, U, base metals and petroleum. This current volume presents some of the latest developments and new information on the temporal and spatial distribution of LIPs in both the Precambrian and Phanerozoic, their origin, the plumbing system of mafic dyke swarms, sill provinces and layered intrusions, and links to mantle plume/superplume events, supercontinent reconstructions and associated metallogeny.

AB  - Background: Landscape fire smoke (LFS) has been associated with reduced birthweight, but evidence from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is rare. Methods: Here, we present a sibling-matched case-control study of 227,948 newborns to identify an association between fire-sourced fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and birthweight in 54 LMICs from 2000 to 2014. We selected mothers from the geocoded Demographic and Health Survey with at least two children and valid birthweight records. Newborns affiliated with the same mother were defined as a family group. Gestational exposure to LFS was assessed in each newborn using the concentration of fire-sourced PM2.5. We determined the associations of the within-group variations in LFS exposure with birthweight differences between matched siblings using a fixed-effects regression model. Additionally, we analyzed the binary outcomes of low birthweight (LBW) or very low birthweight (VLBW). Results: According to fully adjusted models, a 1 mu g/m(3) increase in the concentration of fire-sourced PM2.5 was significantly associated with a 2.17 g (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-3.77) reduction in birthweight, a 2.80% (95% CI 0.97-4.66) increase in LBW risk, and an 11.68% (95% CI 3.59-20.40) increase in VLBW risk. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that gestational exposure to LFS harms fetal health.

AB  - The Northeast of Brazil is a leading region for small ruminants. However, these herds are primarily located in the semi-arid region and face significant losses due to fetal and perinatal mortality, frequently linked to the consumption of teratogenic toxic plants during pregnancy. This study investigated the clinical and epidemiological aspects related to abortions and malformations in 80 small ruminant farms in the semi-arid region of Brazil. Necropsies were also performed on fetuses and neonates, along with histopathological, molecular, and serological analyses of the herds to differentiate other conditions. Malformations were identified on approximately 42 farms, with arthrogryposis being the most common abnormality. Toxic plants, including Mimosa tenuiflora and Cenostigma pyramidalis, were recorded on 95.23% of the properties with reported malformations. Additionally, necropsies confirmed the association between the occurrence of these plants and malformations, abortions, and mortality, excluding infectious causes. These results underscore the urgent need for prevention and control strategies to mitigate the impact of toxic plants on small ruminant production in the semi-arid region.

AB  - Over 15 field seasons (1987-2001), we collected census and life-history data on a population of individually identified ring-tailed lemurs at the Beza Mahafaly Reserve, Madagascar. No significant difference was found in population size over the study period, though a marked decline in the population occurred following a 2-year drought. The population rebounded rapidly after the immediate postdrought period. There was nearly a complete replacement of individuals over the study period. Average group size is 11.5 animals, and adult male to female sex ratio is 0.92. Most females reproduce annually, and the average fecundity rate is 84.3%. The greatest variability in fecundity is found among old females. We suggest that ring-tailed lemur females follow an "income breeding" strategy, i.e., females use maximum resources during reproduction rather than relying on fat stores, as do "capital breeders." Infant mortality to 1 year of age in a nondrought year is 52%, higher than infant mortality in small to medium-sized anthropoids. The oldest known female was 18 years old in 2001. We suggest that 18-20 years may represent the maximum life-span for wild ring-tailed lemurs. Because males regularly emigrate from the population, we have no data regarding male life-span; however, there is some indication that males do not survive as long as females. Group fission has occurred three times: twice from one parent group living in the driest area of the reserve, with the most dispersed food resources. We suggest that the reproductive strategy that has evolved in this species, wherein females reproduce early in life and annually until old age, is a response to the unusual climate and environmental conditions under which Lemur catta has evolved.

AB  - IntroductionMidwives for Haiti is an organization that focuses on the education and training of skilled birth attendants in Haiti, a country with a high rate of maternal and infant mortality and where only 26% of births are attended by skilled health workers. Following the 2010 earthquake, Midwives for Haiti received requests to expand services and numerous professional midwives answered the call to volunteer. This author was one of those volunteers. The purpose of the study was: 1) to develop a description of the program's strengths and its deficits in order to determine if there was a need to improve the preparation of volunteers prior to service and 2) to make recommendations aimed at strengthening the volunteers' contributions to the education of Haiti and auxiliary midwives.
   MethodsThree distinct but closely related questionnaires were developed to survey Haitian students, staff midwives, and volunteers who served with Midwives for Haiti. Questions were designed to elicit information about how well the volunteers were prepared for their experience, the effectiveness of translation services, and suggestions for improving the preparation of volunteers and strengthening the education program.
   ResultsAnalysis of the surveys of volunteers, staff, midwives, and the Haitian students generated several common themes. The 3 groups agreed that the volunteers made an effective contribution to the program of education and that the volunteer midwives need more preparation prior to serving in Haiti. The 3 groups also agreed on the need for better translators and recommended more structure to the education program.
   DiscussionThe results of this study are significant to international health care organizations that use volunteer health care professionals to provide services. The results support a growing body of knowledge that international health aid organizations may use to strengthen the preparation, support, and effectiveness of volunteer health providers.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate whether climate change is associated with male: female ratios (sex ratios) of fetal deaths and births in Japan.
   Design: A population-based cohort study. Setting: Not applicable.
   Patient(s): Newborn infants and fetuses spontaneously aborted after 12 weeks of gestation.
   Intervention(s): None.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Yearly sex ratios of fetal deaths and newborn infants and monthly fetal death rates and sex ratios of newborn infants.
   Result(s): A statistically significant positive association was found between yearly temperature differences and sex ratios of fetal deaths; a statistically significant negative association was found between temperature differences and sex ratios of newborn infants from 1968 to 2012, and between sex ratios of births and of fetal deaths. The sex ratios of fetal deaths have been increasing steadily along with temperature differences, whereas the sex ratios of newborn infants have been decreasing since the 1970s. Two climate extremes, a very hot summer in 2010 and a very cold winter in January 2011, showed not only statistically significant declines in sex ratios of newborn infants 9 months later in June 2011 and October 2011 but also statistically significant increases of fetal death rates immediately, in September 2010 and January 2011.
   Conclusion(s): The recent temperature fluctuations in Japan seem to be linked to a lower male: female sex ratio of newborn infants, partly via increased male fetal deaths. Male concepti seem to be especially vulnerable to external stress factors, including climate changes. (C) 2014 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

AB  - Outbreaks of chondrodysplasia in calves occur sporadically every 10-15 years, particularly following prolonged drought conditions, throughout Northeastern Victoria and the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. An outbreak spanning 2 calving seasons (2003-2004) involving numerous losses through stillbirth, perinatal loss, and poor growth was investigated. Investigations of 4 representative cases are presented here with a definition of the gross and histopathologic defects and an overview of epidemiologic data gathered from affected farms. Calves showed variable disproportionate dwarfism without arthrogryposis. Long bones were shortened and showed axial rotation. Articular surfaces were distorted with misshapen weight-bearing surfaces associated with variable thickness of articular cartilage. Physes were distorted and variable in thickness with occasional foci of complete closure. The major histologic abnormality in the physes was disorderly development of the zones of cartilage hypertrophy, with reduced number and irregular arrangement of hypertrophic chondrocytes; similar less severe changes were present in the zones of cartilage proliferation. Histochemical staining of the cartilage matrix was variable in intensity, and there was evidence of abnormal resorption of cartilage matrix at the level of the primary spongiosa. Osteoid formation and subsequent bone remodelling seemed unaffected, and diaphyseal cortical bone appeared normal at the gross and light microscopic level. No infectious agents were identified, and other known causes for chondrodysplasia in calves were excluded. The most likely cause for the syndrome was considered to be congenital manganese deficiency. Further surveys of tissue and blood manganese levels from cows and calves with and without clinical signs from the region are planned.

AB  - Climate change poses an existential threat to children's health. Divestment of ownership stakes in fossil fuel companies is one tool available to pediatricians to address climate change. Pediatricians are trusted messengers regarding children's health and therefore bear a unique responsibility to advocate for climate and health policies that affect children. Among the impacts of climate change on pediatric patients are allergic rhinitis and asthma; heat-related illnesses; premature birth; injuries from severe storms and fires; vector-borne diseases; and mental illnesses. Children are disproportionately affected as well by climate -related displacement of populations, drought, water shortages, and famine. The human-generated burning of fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause global warming. The US healthcare industry is responsible for 8.5% of the nation's entire greenhouse gases and toxic air pollutants. In this perspectives piece we review the principle of divestment as a strategy for improving childhood health. Healthcare professionals can help combat climate change by embracing divestment in their personal investment portfolios and by their universities, healthcare systems, and professional organizations. We encourage this collaborative organizational effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Background Extreme weather is a recognised risk factor for stillbirth and preterm birth, disrupts women's access to healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth, and negatively affects the care of newborns. Reliable and accessible heat and weather warning systems are key in alerting individuals to undertake protective measures. There is a notable gap in understanding how women and caregivers in rural East Africa perceive and utilize weather information. We investigated community members' heat and weather warning information-seeking behaviour, identified available sources, assessed their reliability and utility, and examined their influence on behaviour. Settings Our research was conducted in rural Kilifi County in Kenya's coastal region. The area experiences temperatures exceeding 23 degrees C throughout the year, with extended periods of extreme temperatures [> 40 degrees C] and long and severe droughts. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews [IDI] with pregnant and postpartum women [n = 21] and held six focus group discussions [FGDs] involving mothers-in-law and community health volunteers [CHVs]. The data were analysed in NVivo 12 using both inductive and deductive approaches. Results We found significant gaps concerning pregnant and post-partum women, and their caregivers, having timely access to weather forecasts and heat information from health or meteorological authorities. Information on heat and weather warnings is disseminated through various channels, including television, radio, mobile phones, and word of mouth, which are facilitated by community influencers such as CHVs and local chiefs. Indigenous methods of weather forecasting, such as cloud observation, consulting local "rainmakers", and studying the behavioural patterns of amphibians, are employed in conjunction with warnings from the Kenyan Meteorological Department (KMD). Barriers to accessing weather information include the cost of television and smartphones and a lack of segmented information in local languages. Conclusions National and county meteorological services need to enhance public participation, communication, and the delivery of heat and weather information to guide community-level response measures and individual behaviour change. They should also collaborate with health professionals to address heat risks for vulnerable groups. Further research is needed to empower indigenous weather predictors with modern weather information and revise national policies to deliver tailored messages to vulnerable populations like pregnant and postpartum women.

AB  - Nomadic and seminomadic pastoralists make optimal use of scarce water and pasture in the arid regions south of the Sahara desert, spreading from Mauretania in the west to Somalia in East Africa. We attempted to summarize the fragmentary evidence from the literature on the health status of these populations and to assess the best ways to provide them with modern health care, infant mortality is higher among nomadic than among neighbouring settled populations, but childhood malnutrition is less frequent. Nomads often avoid exposure to infectious agents by moving away from epidemics such as measles. Trachoma is highly prevalent due to flies attracted by cattle. The high prevalence of tuberculosis is ascribed to the presence of cattle, crowded sleeping quarters and lack of health care; treatment compliance is generally poor. Guinea worm disease is common due to unsafe water sources. Helminth infections are relatively rare as people leave their waste behind when they move. Malaria is usually epidemic, leading to high mortality. Sexually transmitted diseases spread easily due to lack of treatment. Leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis are encountered; brucellosis occurs but most often goes undetected. Drought forces nomads to concentrate near water sources or even into relief camps, with often disastrous consequences for their health. Existing health care systems are in the hands of settled populations and rarely have access to nomads due to cultural, political and economic obstacles. A primary health care system based on nomadic community health workers is outlined and an example of a successful tuberculosis control project is described. Nomadic populations are open to modern health care on the condition that this is not an instrument to control them but something they can control themselves.

AB  - Exposure to environmental stressors is highly prevalent and unequally distributed along socioeconomic lines and may have enduring negative consequences, even when experienced before birth. Yet, estimating the consequences of prenatal stress on children's outcomes is complicated by the issue of confounding (i.e., unobserved factors correlated with stress exposure and with children's outcomes). I combine a natural experiment-a strong earthquake in Chile-with a panel survey to capture the effect of prenatal exposure on acute stress and children's cognitive ability. I find that stress exposure in early pregnancy has no effect on children's cognition among middle-class families, but it has a strong negative influence among disadvantaged families. I then examine possible pathways accounting for the socioeconomic stratification in the effect of stress, including differential exposure across socioeconomic status, differential sensitivity, and parental responses. Findings suggest that the interaction between prenatal exposures and socioeconomic advantage provides a powerful mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage.

AB  - Due to climate change, bushfires are becoming a more frequent and more severe phenomenon which contributes to poor health effects associated with air pollution. In pregnancy, environmental exposures can have lifelong consequences for the fetus, but little is known about these consequences in the context of bushfire smoke exposure. In this review we summarise the current knowledge in this area, and propose a potential mechanism linking bushfire smoke exposure in utero to poor perinatal and respiratory outcomes in the offspring. Bushfire smoke exposure is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes including reduced birth weight and an increased risk of prematurity. Some publications have outlined the adverse health effects on young children, particularly in relation to emergency department presentations and hospital admissions for respiratory problems, but there are no studies in children who were exposed to bushfire smoke in utero. Prenatal stress is likely to occur as a result of catastrophic bushfire events, and stress is known to be associated with poor perinatal and respiratory outcomes. Changes to DNA methylation are potential epigenetic mechanisms linking both smoke particulate exposure and prenatal stress to poor childhood respiratory health outcomes. More research is needed in large pregnancy cohorts exposed to bushfire events to explore this further, and to design appropriate mitigation interventions, in this area of global public health importance.

AB  - Transporters are essential in homeostatic exchange of endogenous and exogenous substances at the systematic, organic, cellular, and subcellular levels. Gene mutations of transporters are often related to pharmacogenetics traits. Recent developments in high throughput technologies on genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics allow in depth studies of transporter genes in normal cellular processes and diverse disease conditions. The flood of high throughput data have resulted in urgent need for an updated knowledgebase with curated, organized, and annotated human transporters in an easily accessible way. Using a pipeline with the combination of automated keywords query, sequence similarity search and manual curation on transporters, we collected 1,555 human non-redundant transporter genes to develop the Human Transporter Database (HTD) (http://htd.cbi.pku.edu.cn). Based on the extensive annotations, global properties of the transporter genes were illustrated, such as expression patterns and polymorphisms in relationships with their ligands. We noted that the human transporters were enriched in many fundamental biological processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and cardiac muscle contraction, and significantly associated with Mendelian and complex diseases such as epilepsy and sudden infant death syndrome. Overall, HTD provides a well-organized interface to facilitate research communities to search detailed molecular and genetic information of transporters for development of personalized medicine.

KW  - rural
AB  - The Deep South has often been characterized as the poorest and most backward region in the United States. The Deep South is also unique in that it is the most racially diverse part of the United States and it has the powerful social history of chattel slavery. In this paper, we examine the relationship between race and poverty at the macro (rather than individual) level. Using county-level census data we examine the effects of social segregation on well-being. We find that indeed there is an extremely strong and significant relationship between the racial composition of a county and many measures of well-being (poverty, home ownership, educational attainment, infant mortality and so on). Second, our analysis tests for the effects of racial segregation for whites and African Americans separately. The poverty rate for whites varies little based on the racial composition of the county they live in whereas for African Americans, living in integrated or predominately white counties is significantly correlated with lower levels of poverty. Furthermore, the African American- white poverty gap is significantly lower in integrated and predominately white counties and significantly higher in counties that are racially segregated. Thus, our analysis demonstrates that racial segregation has a more negative and profound effect on the lives of African Americans than it does on whites. We conclude with a discussion of the illustration Hurricane Katrina provides of this general pattern and we offer a set of suggestions for addressing this kind of structural poverty.

AB  - Pulmonary hemosiderosis has been attributed to airborne fungi in water-damaged homes in studies of a cluster of cases in infants and children in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1997. We have searched for such emerging infectious agents in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, which is subject to intermittent flooding. Pulmonary tissue from 206 infants and young children whose deaths had been investigated from October 1978 to September 1996 was retained at East Carolina University School of Medicine. Ages ranged from premature newborns to 49-months. One hundred and ten deaths were attributed to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). New sections were cut and analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin, Prussian blue for iron. and Gomori methenamine silver for fungal organisms. Twenty-three infants and children had iron-containing macrophages. Sixteen of these had underlying illnesses, but 4 were originally diagnosed as SIDS. Only one of these had sufficient hemosiderosis to be considered as having pulmonary hemosiderosis and no fungi were present. One case without iron had fungi and was not originally diagnosed as SIDS. The single case of pulmonary hemosiderosis found in this rural area is not similar to the cluster in Cleveland. The study identifies no fungal organisms as emerging infectious diseases in this area.

AB  - Skills are an important predictor of labour, education, and wellbeing outcomes. Understanding the origins of skills formation is important for reducing future inequalities. This paper analyses the effect of shocks in-utero on human capital outcomes in childhood and adolescence in India. Combining historical rainfall data and longitudinal data from Young Lives, we estimate the effect of rainfall shocks in-utero on cognitive and non-cognitive skills development over the first 15 years of life. We find negative effects of rainfall shocks on receptive vocabulary at age 5, and on mathematics and non-cognitive skills at age 15. The negative effects on cognitive skills are driven by boys, while the effect for both cognitive and non-cognitive skills are driven by children of parents with lower education, suggesting that prenatal shocks might exacerbate pre-existing inequalities. Our findings support the implementation of policies aiming at reducing inequalities at very early stages in life.

AB  - Do aggregate income shocks, such as those caused by macroeconomic crises or droughts, reduce child human capital? The answer to this question has important implications for public policy. If shocks reduce investments in children, they may have a long-lasting impact on poverty and its intergenerational transmission. The authors develop a simple framework to analyze the effects of aggregate economic shocks on child schooling and health. They show that the expected effects are theoretically ambiguous because of a tension between income and substitution effects. They then review the recent empirical literature on the subject. In richer countries, like the United States, child health and education outcomes are counter-cyclical: they improve during recessions. In poorer countries, mostly in Africa and low-income Asia, the outcomes are procyclical: infant mortality rises and school enrollment and nutrition fall during recessions. In the middle-income countries of Latin America, the picture is more nuanced: health outcomes are generally procyclical and education outcomes counter-cyclical. Each of these findings is consistent with the simple conceptual framework. The authors discuss possible implications for expenditure allocation.

AB  - We examined intra- and inter-litter variation in larval life-history traits in relation to maternal weight and date of larval deposition in a population of fire salamanders Salamandra salamandra terrestris in northwestern Switzerland. We also examined whether the timing of larval deposition by female fire salamanders is an adaptive strategy to the changing conditions of a temporary brook. Litters differed in mean weight at birth, weight at metamorphosis, and duration of the larval period. Mean weight at birth tended to be larger in litters deposited later in the season than in those deposited earlier. Large neonates reached metamorphosis more rapidly than small ones. A short larval period resulted in a small size at metamorphosis, indicating a fitness trade-off between duration of the larval period and size at metamorphosis. Within litters, successively-born larvae tend to decrease in body size, especially in litters with a relatively large variation in weight at birth. The results suggest that environmental factors such as floods or drying out of the brook may influence the timing of larval deposition.

AB  - Nicobari pig is semi-feral, reared in free-range system with very low level of management. However, its population has been significantly reduced due to and after Tsunami in 2004. No systematic study has been conducted to explore the production potential of Nicobari pig. Therefore, a systematic comparison study was conducted between intensive and free-range system on growth and reproductive parameters in ICAR-CIARI. Port Blair. Reproductive parameters like age at first mating in male and age at first oestrus, oestrus cycle duration, oestrous duration, age at first mating, age at first farrowing, farrowing interval, litter size at farrowing and weaning, litter weight, still birth and mortality were recorded. Growth parameters like body weight at birth, at weaning and at months 3, 6 and 9 were recorded. Results revealed that significantly higher body weights at months 3. 6, 9 and 12 were recorded under intensive than in free-range system in male and female pigs and in male than in female. Non-significant differences was observed in the reproductive parameters in pigs between the two systems except parameters like oestrous cycle duration was higher and age at first mating, stillbirth and mortality were lower significantly in pigs under intensive system than in free range system. It was concluded that growth and reproductive performances of Nicobari pigs reared under intensive system has significantly higher beneficial than in free-range system.

AB  - Forests are vital life-preserving assets, essential for biodiversity, human health, climate change mitigation, and economic stability. Yet, they are increasingly threatened by forest fires, which undermine these benefits. In the first half of 2025, forest fires in the United States burned over 810,000 acres, Canada lost 7.3 million hectares, while the 2020 Australian mega-fires, which caused an estimated US $20 billion in economic losses, illustrate the scale and urgency of the problem. Despite such impacts, research integrating the diverse dimensions of forest fires, including suppression costs, health effects, tourism, economic impacts, technological advancements, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, remains limited. This study systematically reviews 142 peer-reviewed publications from 2000 to 2023, underscoring the importance of applying theoretical frameworks to practical fire management strategies, bridging the gap between academic insight and real-world application. The findings show that forest fires generate cascading effects on economic growth, ecological services, biodiversity, human health, and macroeconomic stability, all critical for achieving sustainable development goals. Persistent research gaps include the scarcity of region-specific long-term studies, limited integration of opportunity costs into economic assessments, insufficient attention to chronic health impacts, lack of socio-ecological evaluations, minimal empirical work on indigenous populations, and inadequate practical assessment of fire management technologies. Addressing these gaps require investigation into demographic outcomes such as infant mortality and female fertility rates, adoption of advanced valuation methods including the Replacement Cost Method and the Avoided Cost Method, and systematic study of climate-fire feedback loops to ensure theoretical models are effectively translated into actionable strategies for sustainable development and resilience.

AB  - Genetic improvement is a key to future increases in productivity in the Australian Mohair industry. Accurate identification of superior sires is part of this process. A progeny test was established to evaluate some prominent sires in use within the Australian Mohair industry. Angora does (n = 511) were mated to 11 Angora sires using artificial insemination in April, 2002. A total of 270 progeny was evaluated at their first shearing at 6 months of age and 246 were evaluated at the second shearing at 12 months of age. The project site experienced a severe drought for the 2002 season resulting in lower than expected kidding performance, average clean fleece weights (0.70 and 0.95 kg) and fibre diameters (20.3 and 21.2 mu m) at first and second shearings respectively. Progeny sex and birth type had effects on greasy fleece weight and clean fleece weight at both shearings, on mean fibre diameter at the first shearing, birth weight and live weight at 3, 5, 11 and 15 months of age. The effect of the age of dam was evident for greasy fleece weight, clean fleece weight and medullation at the first shearing; clean fleece weight and yield at the second shearing; birth weight and live weight at 3, 5, 11 and 15 months of age. Differences between sires were small but apparent for the majority of fibre quality traits as well as live weight at 15 months of age. The third shearing, and a genetic analysis utilising dam pedigree, will expand results further and is likely to reveal larger differences between sires.

AB  - Assess the amount of agreement between the classification of stress from the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Assessment of Stress portion of the Prenatal Psychosocial Profile (PPP) among pregnant women. A secondary data analysis on a cross-sectional study of 301 pregnant women from the New Orleans and Baton Rouge areas who were exposed to Hurricane Katrina was conducted. Women with complete data (219) were analyzed. Women scoring in the third tertile of each instrument were compared. The kappa statistic was used to assess agreement between instruments. Additional comparisons were made with three instruments that measure other important psychosocial constructs that could be related to stress: the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) and the Assessments of Support (partner and other support) and Self-Esteem from the PPP. No significant difference was found between the two tests. The PSS and the PPP were both statistically significantly correlated to each other (rho = 0.71, p < 0.01). Thirty-five women were classified discordantly resulting in a Kappa Coefficient of 0.61 (95 % CI 0.50-0.72, p < 0.01). No significant differences were found between these two instruments in correlation with the EDS (PPP, r = 0.76; PSS, r = 0.72; p < 0.01 for each), partner support (PPP, r = -0.47; PSS r = -0.46; p < 0.01 for each), other support (PPP, r = -0.31; PSS r = -0.32; p < 0.01 for each) and self-esteem (PPP, r = -0.41; PSS, r = -0.52; p < 0.01 for each), respectively. Given the similarities between the PSS and PPP, researchers are encouraged to choose and administer one instrument to participants, or to use the instruments in combination as an external reliability check.

AB  - BackgroundStressful large-scale events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters, impact birthing individuals' postpartum experiences and their mental health. Resultant changes in government assistance, housing, and employment may further exacerbate these impacts, with differences experienced by varying income levels and races. This study aimed to examine maternal depression and anxiety in postpartum individuals by income and race during a stressful large-scale event, and the mediating role of government assistance, housing, and employment.MethodsAn explanatory sequential mixed methods study was conducted (QUANT + QUAL). For aim 1 (quantitative), birthing individuals who delivered during peak pandemic (June 2020 - September 2021) completed questionnaires related to their perinatal experiences and mental health. Macrosystem factors (government assistance, housing, and employment changes) were assessed using the Psychosocial Recommended Measures. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7) assessed depression and anxiety, respectively. Serial linear regression models assessed the relationship between race and income with mental health and macrosystem factors. For aim 2 (qualitative), 40 individuals from the quantitative study balanced by income (low vs. high income) and race (Black vs. White) completed one-on-one semi-structured interviews which were analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsAmongst 1582 birthing individuals, Black individuals had a significantly higher EPDS score compared to White counterparts. Not receiving government assistance, unstable housing, and experiencing various employment changes were all related to worse mental health during stressful large-scale events. In semi-structured interviews, low-income individuals discussed that government assistance helped alleviate a financial and mental burden. Low- and high-income individuals reported varying job changes that impacted their mental health (low-income: job loss, high-income: increased hours).ConclusionsThis research spotlights the negative impact of large-scale events most affected both Black and low-income individuals' postpartum mental health, and the role of government assistance, stable housing, and secure employment in helping to alleviate these disparities between income levels.

AB  - Animal and human studies suggest that prenatal exposure to stress is associated with adverse health outcomes such as type 2 diabetes. Epigenetic modification, such as DNA methylation, is considered one possible underlying mechanism. The 1998 Quebec ice storm provides a unique opportunity to study an independent prenatal stressor on child outcomes. C-peptide is the best measure of endogenous insulin secretion and is widely used in the clinical management of patients with diabetes. The objectives of this study are to determine 1) the extent to which prenatal exposure to disaster-related stress (maternal objective hardship and maternal cognitive appraisal) influences children's C-peptide secretion, and 2) whether DNA methylation of diabetes-related genes mediates the effects of prenatal stress on C-peptide secretion. Children's (n = 30) C-peptide secretion in response to an oral glucose tolerance test were assessed in blood at 13 1/2 years. DNA methylation levels of selected type 1 and 2 diabetes-related genes were chosen based upon the genes associated with prenatal maternal objective hardship and/or cognitive appraisal levels. Bootstrapping analyses were performed to determine the mediation effect of DNA methylation. We found that children whose mothers experienced higher objective hardship exhibited higher C-peptide secretion. Cognitive appraisal was not directly associated with C-peptide secretion. DNA methylation of diabetes-related genes had a positive mediation effect of objective hardship on C-peptide secretion: higher objective hardship predicted higher C-peptide secretion through DNA methylation. Negative mediation effects of cognitive appraisal were observed: negative cognitive appraisal predicted higher C-peptide secretion through DNA methylation. However, only one gene, LTA, remained a significant mediator of cognitive appraisal on C-peptide secretion after the conservative Bonferroni multiple corrections. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation could act as an intervening variable between prenatal stress and metabolic outcomes, highlighting the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in response to environmental factors.

AB  - How reproductive output changes with age or size is a key life-history trait that can affect which demographic rates most influence population growth. Although many studies have investigated the reproductive ecology of gartersnakes, we know little about reproduction in the threatened Giant Gartersnake, Thamnophis gigas. We used X-radiography to determine reproductive status and estimated fecundity for 73 female T. gigas collected from several regions within the range of this species in the Sacramento Valley of California, USA, and synthesize these data with data from litters born in captivity to improve our understanding of reproduction in this species. Average total litter size determined from X-rays (15.9) and captive-born litters (15.5) are within the ranges reported from other gartersnakes, but captive-born litters had high rates of stillbirth. Only 154 of 202 neonates from captive snakes were born alive, and seven of 13 litters contained at least one stillborn neonate. We found that fecundity was positively related to maternal snout-vent length, and some evidence that larger litters contained smaller neonates. The proportion of X-rayed females that were gravid was 0.50 in 2014, 0.47 in and 2015, and 0.64 in 2016. Central California experienced an exceptional drought from 2012-2015, which may have affected the reproductive output and frequency of T. gigas. Our estimates of reproductive frequency and size-dependent fecundity in T. gigas provide valuable information that can be used in demographic models of this threatened species. Our results demonstrate that X-radiography is a useful, minimally invasive means to study fecundity in wild populations of snakes.

AB  - Weanling mammals (including infants) often experience intestinal dysfunction when fed a high-protein diet. Recent work with the piglet (an animal model for studying human infant nutrition) shows that reducing protein intake can improve gut function during weaning but compromises the provision of essential amino acids (EAA) for muscle growth. The present study was conducted with weaned pigs to test the hypothesis that supplementing deficient EAA (Lys, Met, Thr, Trp, Leu, Ile and Val) to a low-protein diet may maintain the activation of translation initiation factors and adequate protein synthesis in tissues. Pigs were weaned at 21 days of age and fed diets containing 20.7, 16.7 or 12.7% crude protein (CP), with the low-CP diets supplemented with EAA to achieve the levels in the high-CP diet. On Day 14 of the trial, tissue protein synthesis was determined using the phenylalanine flooding dose method. Reducing dietary CP levels decreased protein synthesis in pancreas, liver, kidney and longissimus muscle. A low-CP diet reduced the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1) in skeletal muscle and liver while increasing the formation of an inactive eIF4E.4E-BP1 complex in muscle. Dietary protein deficiency also decreased the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the formation of an active eIF4E.eIF4G complex in liver. These results demonstrate for the first time that chronic feeding of a low-CP diet suppresses protein synthesis in animals partly by inhibiting mTOR signaling. Additionally, our findings indicate that supplementing deficient EAA to low-protein diets is not highly effective in restoring protein synthesis or whole-body growth in piglets. We suggest that conditionally essential amino acids (e.g., glutamine and arginine) may be required to maintain the activation of translation initiation factors and optimal protein synthesis in neonates.

AB  - BackgroundA significant decrease in secondary sex ratio in December 2020 in Japan has been reported, suggesting the COVID-19 pandemic was a population-level stressor. However, few studies have investigated detailed trends in secondary sex ratio during the pandemic. This study aimed to describe the proportion of male births in Japan by month, mother's age and whether it was her first live birth, and suggest potential causes of anomalous variations during the COVID-19 pandemic, including variations in monthly spontaneous fetal deaths.MethodsJapanese national vital statistics data for 2006-2022 were used. Monthly proportion of male births by mother's age and whether it was her first live birth were analyzed. Spontaneous fetal death rates were also examined. Using a method similar to the \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\overline{\text{X} }$$\end{document}-R control chart, anomalous variations in each indicator during COVID-19 were identified and the excess proportion of male births and excess spontaneous fetal deaths were estimated.ResultsAbnormal increases in the proportion of male births occurred in March 2020, November 2021 and June 2022, and a decrease in December 2020 and the biggest decrease in September 2021. These abnormal variations did not occur among first live births for mother's 20-29 and 40 or over, but there was an increase in March 2022 among subsequent live births for mother's 20-29, and decreases in March or April 2022 among all first live birth groups except women 20-29. Decreases occurred in October-December 2022 among first live births for all mother's up to 39, and increases in at least one month each of June-August, or December 2022 among the same age groups for subsequent live births. Spontaneous fetal deaths increased abnormally only in August 2022.ConclusionsAbnormal increases in spontaneous fetal deaths could not explain male birth proportion decreases. Abnormal decreases in proportion of male births occurred approximately 8-10 months after Japan's state of emergency declarations, but not 8-10 months after stimulus payments among groups with targeted families. Financial support might therefore have prevented decreases in the proportion of male births during states of emergency, but analytical studies are needed to test this hypothesis.

AB  - In response to the 2010 earthquake and subsequent cholera epidemic, St Luke's Medical Center was established in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Here, we describe its inception and evolution to include an intensive care unit and two operating rooms, as well as the staffing, training and experiential learning activities, which helped St Luke's become a sustainable surgical resource. We describe a three-phase model for establishing a sustainable surgical centre in Haiti (build facility and acquire equipment; train staff and perform surgeries; provide continued education and expansion including regular specialist trips) and we report a progressive increase in the number and complexity of cases performed by all-Haitian staff from 2012 to 2022. The results are generalised in the context of the 'delay framework' to global health along with a discussion of the application of this three-phase model to resource-limited environments. We conclude with a brief description of the formation of a remote surgical centre in Port-Salut, an unforeseen benefit of local competence and independence. Establishing sustainable and collaborative surgery centres operated by local staff accelerates the ability of resource-limited countries to meet high surgical burdens.

AB  - Particular concern at the present stage is the health effects of wildfires' smoke. The aim of the study was to determine the impact of paternal biomass-smoke exposure on offspring's behavior and cognitive abilities. Male rats were exposed to biomass smoke for four hours/day, five days/week, for four weeks. Average concentration of carbon monoxide and particulate matter of 2.5 mu m PM2.5 in the chamber during exposure were 28.7 +/- 5.3 mg/m(3) and 1.9 +/- 0.5 mg/m(3), respectively. At the same time, high concentrations of furfural and acetaldehyde were detected in the air environment of the exposure chambers. Offspring was obtained by mating of experimental males with untreated females, immediately after the end of the exposure and after 60 days (long-term period). Offspring were tested by using the Morris water maze and open field at three months of age. Male and female offspring born by mating immediately after exposure demonstrated decreased exploratory behavior, locomotor activity, and spatial navigation, as well as increased anxiety levels. Locomotor and exploratory activity in rats of both sexes from progeny obtained after long-term exposure to smoke had no statistically significant differences when compared to the control; however, the females showed a high level of anxiety and impaired cognitive functions. The recovery period after biomass-smoke intoxication, comparable in duration of spermatogenesis in rats, was an important factor in reducing the risk of developing central nervous system (CNS) disorders in offspring.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a multipurpose tropical tree-legume that is highly resistant to many biotic and abiotic stresses. Leucaena is used primarily as an animal fodder owing to its protein-rich foliage. However, leucaena foliage also contains mimosine, a toxic non-protein amino acid that can cause alopecia, goiter and other thyroid problems, infertility and fetal death. Considering its toxicity and abundance in leucaena, it is important to quantify the mimosine concentrations in leucaena under different environmental conditions. Mimosine was extracted from various types of leucaena tissue exposed to a range of environmental conditions and then quantified by HPLC. The mimosine concentrations in leucaena treated with NaCl increased after 6 days of treatment and remained relatively high when treatment continued for 18 days. Interestingly, leucaena exposed to complete darkness for up to 5 days had a higher mimosine concentration than control plants exposed to normal light/dark photoperiods. On the other hand, drying leucaena leaflets or macerating them in an alkaline buffer significantly lowered their mimosine concentration. Mature leaflets that had fallen off the plant and dried out also contained significantly less mimosine than fresh leaflets. The results of this study indicate that mimosine concentrations in leucaena are affected by environmental conditions and this knowledge can assist in managing to prevent toxicity.

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between weather conditions and child nutrition in Ethiopia. We link data from four rounds of the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey to high-resolution climate data to measure exposure to rainfall and temperature in utero and during early life. We then estimate a set of multivariate regression models to understand how weather conditions impact child stunting, an indicator of sustained early life undernutrition. We find that greater rainfall during the rainy seasons in early life is associated with greater height for age. In addition, higher temperatures in utero, particularly during the first and third trimesters, and more rainfall during the third trimester, are positively associated with severe stunting, though stunting decreases with temperature in early life. We find potential evidence for a number of pathways underlying the weather-child nutrition relationship including agricultural livelihoods, heat stress, infectious disease transmission, and women's time use during pregnancy. These findings illuminate the complex pathways through which climate change may influence child health and should motivate additional research focused on identifying the causal mechanisms underlying these links.

AB  - Understanding the way prosimian primates age can be helpful in inferring what the 'basal primate mode' of senescence may have been. Even though prosimians are known to be long-lived in captivity, relatively little is known about their reproductive senescence, and even less is known about how prosimians age in their natural habitats. Twenty years of observational data in Madagascar for four Propithecus edwordsi sifaka groups were used to analyze reproductive and behavioral trends of aging in the wild. Techniques using tooth wear were developed to establish ages of wild sifakas and to estimate the onset of their 'dental senescence', a proxy for the onset of decline in the ability to obtain nutrition. Estimated maximum longevity was 32 years for female sifakas. Based on the loss of dental functional morphology, and changes in tooth wear patterns and in chewing efficiency, dental senescence was estimated to set in at approximately 18 years of age. Of the adult females in the study groups, the yearly average of the number of dentally senescent females was 24%. There was no indication of a decline in fertility in the dentally senescent females (aged > 18 years) compared to younger adult females (aged 4-18 years). The field data showed, however, that in years when rain was decreased during months of prime lactation, infants of dentally senescent mothers died before weaning. This may be because the nursing mother's worn teeth could not shear leaves and extract moisture, nor nutrition, both essential for successful lactation. Old females showed no clear signs of social disengagement, further suggesting that drought-induced stress plays a direct role in increased infant mortality. These data support earlier findings that prosimian females continue to cycle and give birth until death. The effect of environmental variation on infant survival, however, indicates an incipient age-linked decline in reproductive fitness. Therefore, whereas lemurs represent the condition of no menopause, changes in infant survival may uncover selective factors that have in part led to the evolution of menopause in other primates.

AB  - Background: Mozambique has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. The main influences on maternal health encompass social, economic, political, environmental and cultural determinants of health. To effectively address maternal mortality in the post-2015 agenda, interventions need to consider the determinants of health so that their delivery is not limited to the health sector. The objective of this exploratory qualitative study was to identify key community groups' perspectives on the perceived determinants of maternal health in rural areas of southern Mozambique.
   Methods: Eleven focus group discussions were conducted with women of reproductive age, pregnant women, matrons, male partners, community leaders and health workers. Participants were recruited using sampling techniques of convenience and snow balling. Focus groups had an average of nine participants each. The heads of 12 administrative posts were also interviewed to understand the local context. Data were coded and analysed thematically using NVivo software.
   Results: A broad range of political, economic, socio-cultural and environmental determinants of maternal health were identified by community representatives. It was perceived that the civil war has resulted in local unemployment and poverty that had a number of downstream effects including lack of funds for accessing medical care and transport, and influence on socio-cultural determinants, particularly gender relations that disadvantaged women. Socio-cultural determinants included intimate partner violence toward women, and strained relationships with in-laws and co-spouses. Social relationships were complex as there were both negative and positive impacts on maternal health. Environmental determinants included natural disasters and poor access to roads and transport exacerbated by the wet season and subsequent flooding.
   Conclusions: In rural southern Mozambique, community perceptions of the determinants of maternal health included political, economic, socio-cultural and environmental factors. These determinants were closely linked with one another and highlight the importance of including the local history, context, culture and geography in the design of maternal health programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The human secondary sex ratio reportedly falls in populations subjected to exogenous stressors such as earthquakes or political and social upheavals. Explanations of the association include reduced conception of males and increased fetal deaths among males. The latter explanation has been supported by research reporting that the sex ratio in California fell 3 months, but not 8, 9 or 10 months, after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. California's distance from the attacks raises the questions of whether the results arose from chance and would be found elsewhere. We contribute to the literature by testing the association between the secondary sex ratio and the events of September 11 in New York City. METHODS: We replicate the California tests by applying interrupted time-series methods, which control for secular trends, seasonality and other forms of autocorrelation, to 91 cohorts born in New York City during 28-day periods from January 1996 to June 2002. RESULTS: As hypothesized, the sex ratio in New York City in the period 1 January to 28 January 2002 fell to 1, which was the lowest observed value during the test period and significantly (i.e. P < 0.01, two-tailed test) below the value expected from history. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the male fetal loss explanation of the association between exogenous population shocks and the secondary sex ratio.

AB  - Introduction
   Leptospirosis is a leading zoonotic disease worldwide with more than 1 million cases in the general population per year. With leptospirosis being an emerging infectious disease and as the world's environment changes with more floods and environmental disasters, the burden of leptospirosis is expected to increase. The objectives of the systematic review were to explore how leptospirosis affects pregnancy, its burden in this population, its effects on maternal and fetal outcomes and the evidence base surrounding treatment options
   Methods
   We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished literature using automated and manual methods to screen nine electronic databases since inception, with no language restriction. Two reviewers independently screened articles, completed the data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. Due to significant heterogeneity and paucity of data, we were unable to carry out a meta-analysis, but we conducted a pooled analysis of individual patient data from the case reports and case series to examine the patient and disease characteristics, diagnostic methods, differential diagnoses, antibiotic treatments, and outcomes of leptospirosis in pregnancy. The protocol for this review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO: CRD42020151501.
   Results
   We identified 419 records, of which we included eight observational studies, 21 case reports, three case series and identified four relevant ongoing studies. Overall the studies were with moderate bias and of 'fair' quality. We estimated the incidence of leptospirosis in pregnancy to be 1.3 per 10,000 in women presenting with fever or with jaundice, but this is likely to be higher in endemic areas. Adverse fetal outcomes were found to be more common in pregnant patients who presented in the second trimester compared with patients who presented in the third trimester. There is overlap between how leptospirosis presents in pregnancy and in the general population. There is also overlap between the signs, symptoms and biochemical disturbances associated with leptospirosis in pregnancy and the presentation of pregnancy associated conditions, such as Pre-Eclampsia (PET), Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) and HELLP Syndrome (Haemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platelets). In 94% of identified cases with available data, there was an indicator in the patient history regarding exposure that could have helped include leptospirosis in the clinician's differential diagnosis. We also identified a range of suitable antibiotic therapies for treating leptospirosis in pregnancy, most commonly used were penicillins
   Conclusion
   This is the first systematic review of leptospirosis in pregnancy and it clearly shows the need to improve early diagnosis and treatment by asking early, treating early, and reporting well. Ask early-broaden differential diagnoses and ask early for potential leptospirosis exposures and risk factors. Treat early-increase index of suspicion in pregnant patients with fever in endemic areas and combine with rapid field diagnosis and early treatment. Report well-need for more good quality epidemiological studies on leptospirosis in pregnancy and better quality reporting of cases in literature

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dead space is the part of the airway where no gas exchange takes place. Any increase in dead space volume has a proportional effect on the required tidal volume and thus on the risk of ventilation-induced lung injury. Inserts that increase dead space are therefore not used in small preterm infants. This includes end-tidal CO2 measurement.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the end-tidal CO2 measurement adapter on ventilation.
   METHODS: In an experimental setup, an end-tidal CO2 measurement adapter, three different pneumotachographs (PNT-A, PNT-B, PNT-Neo), and a closed suction adapter were combined in varying set-ups. The time required for CO2 elimination by a CO 2-flooded preterm infant test lung was measured.
   RESULTS: PNT-A prolonged CO2 elimination time by 0.9 s (+3.3%), Neo-PNT by 3.2 s (+11.6%) and PNT-B by 9.0 s (+32.7%). The end-tidal CO2 measurement adapter prolonged the elimination time by an additional second without the pneumotachograph (+3.6%) and in combination with PNT-A (+3.1%) and PNT-Neo (+3.1%). In conjunction with PNT-B, the end-tidal CO2 measurement adapter reduced the elimination time by 0.3 seconds (1%). The use of a closed suction adaptor increased the CO2 elimination time by a further second with PNT-Neo (+3.1%) and by an additional two seconds with no flow sensor (+6.9%), with PNT-A (+6.4%) and with PNT-B (+5.5%).
   CONCLUSION: The flow sensor had the greatest influence on ventilatory effort, while end-tidal CO2 measurement had only a moderate effect. The increased ventilatory effort levied by the CO2 measurement was dependent on the flow sensor selected. The use of closed suctioning more negatively impacted ventilatory effort than did end-tidal CO2 measurement.

AB  - In the present developed world, all of us are flooded with electromagnetic radiations (EMR) emanating from generation and transmission of electricity, domestic appliances and industrial equipments, to telecommunications and broadcasting. We have been exposed to EMR for last many decades; however their recent steady increase from artificial sources has been reported as millions of antennas and satellites irradiate the global population round the clock, year round. Needless to say, these are so integral to modern life that interaction with them on a daily basis is seemingly inevitable; hence, the EMR exposure load has increased to a point where their health effects are becoming a major concern. Delicate and sensitive electrical system of human body is affected by consistent penetration of electromagnetic frequencies causing DNA breakages and chromosomal aberrations. Technological innovations came with Pandora's Box of hazardous consequences including neurodegenerative disorders, hearing disabilities, diabetes, congenital abnormalities, infertility, cardiovascular diseases and cancer to name few, all on a sharp rise. Electromagnetic non-ionizing radiations pose considerable health threat with prolonged exposure. Mobile phones are usually held near to the brain and manifest progressive structural or functional alterations in neurons leading to neurodegenerative diseases and neuronal death. This has provoked awareness among both the general public and scientific community and international bodies acknowledge that further systematic research is needed. The aim of the present review was to have an insight in whether and how cumulative electro-magnetic field exposure is a risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Migrants from Mexico to the U.S. tend to be healthier than non-migrants in their origin part of a pattern termed the "healthy migrant effect". With climate change altering livelihoods across the globe, we ask how the migration-health connection may be altered by environmental strain. On the one hand, positive health selectivity may be intensified if migration becomes more challenging and therefore increasingly likely to be undertaken by only the healthiest. On the other hand, positive health selectivity may decline if the "push" associated with environmental strain acts upon individuals regardless of health. We use Mexican Migration Project data to model Mexico-US migration by male household heads with consideration of migrant health as well as recent rainfall conditions in communities of origin. Results reveal intriguing interactions such that when moderately dry regions experience rainfall shortage, health selectivity is lower meaning that less healthy household heads also engage in international migration. We posit that social networks may underlie this association. We further argue that since environmental context may alter the relationship between migration and health, future research on the "healthy migrant effect" should consider environmental conditions. As to implications, if climate change yields pressure on less healthy individuals to migrate, the need for migrant-sensitive health systems and services may be intensified in destination regions.

AB  - Purpose: Pregnant women are vulnerable to stress. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) has caused a global pandemic and created significant stress for many people. Social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19 has also reduced social interactions, which has increased social isolation and loneliness. Loneliness is thought to increase perceived stress, cause psychological distress, and increase the risk of mental illness, such as depression. This study examined the association between serious psychological distress (SPD) and loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant Japanese women. Patients and Methods: An internet survey of 1022 pregnant women in Japan was conducted between June 1 and July 21, 2021. The 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, 3-item Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale were used as measurement tools. The prevalence of SPD was defined as a K6 score of >= 13. Results: The prevalence of SPD was 16.5%. Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk factors for SPD were younger age (odds ratio [OR] 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.10; p = 0.020), history of abortion or miscarriages (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.36; p = 0.034), unemployment (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.45; p = 0.008), fear of COVID-19 (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.17; p < 0.001), and loneliness (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.38 to 1.70; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Pregnant women in Japan showed a high prevalence of SPD. Younger age, unemployment, history of abortion or miscarriages, fear of COVID-19, and loneliness were independently associated with SPD. Clinicians and health officials should pay particular attention to the psychological health of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Japan: Universal Health Care at 50 years 5 Re-invigorating Japan's commitment to global health: challenges and opportunities
T2  - LANCET

KW  - DISEASES
KW  - G8
AB  - Over the past 50 years, Japan has successfully developed and maintained an increasingly equitable system of universal health coverage in addition to achieving the world's highest life expectancy and one of the lowest infant mortality rates. Against this backdrop, Japan is potentially in a position to become a leading advocate for and supporter of global health. Nevertheless, Japan's engagement with global health has not been outstanding relative to its substantial potential, in part because of government fragmentation, a weak civil society, and lack of transparency and assessment. Japan's development assistance for health, from both governmental and non-governmental sectors, has remained low and Japanese global health leadership has been weak. New challenges arising from changes in governance and global and domestic health needs, including the recent Great East Japan Earthquake, now provide Japan with an opportunity to review past approaches to health policy and develop a new strategy for addressing global and national health. The fragmented functioning of the government with regards to global health policy needs to be reconfigured and should be accompanied by further financial commitment to global health priorities, innovative non-governmental sector initiatives, increased research capacity, and investments in good leadership development as witnessed at the G8 Hokkaido Toyako Summit. Should this strategy development and commitment be achieved, Japan has the potential to make substantial contributions to the health of the world as many countries move toward universal coverage and as Japan itself faces the challenge of maintaining its own health system.

AB  - Heat exposure in pregnancy is associated with a range of adverse health and wellbeing outcomes, yet research on the lived experience of pregnancy in high temperatures is lacking. We conducted qualitative research in 2021 in two communities in rural Kilifi County, Kenya, a tropical savannah area currently experiencing severe drought. Pregnant and postpartum women, their male spouses and mothers-in-law, community health volunteers, and local health and environment stakeholders were interviewed or participated in focus group discussions. Pregnant women described symptoms that are classically regarded as heat exhaustion, including dizziness, fatigue, dehydration, insomnia, and irritability. They interpreted heat-related tachycardia as signalling hypertension and reported observing more miscarriages and preterm births in the heat. Pregnancy is conceptualised locally as a 'normal' state of being, and women continue to perform physically demanding household chores in the heat, even when pregnant. Women reported little support from family members to reduce their workload at this time, reflecting their relative lack of autonomy within the household, but also potentially the 'normalisation' of heat in these communities. Climate change risk reduction strategies for pregnant women in low-resource settings need to be cognisant of local household gender dynamics that constrain women's capacity to avoid heat exposures.

AB  - Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic viral disease affecting domestic and wild ruminants, camels and humans. The causative agent of RVF, the RVF virus (RVFV), has the capacity to cause large and severe outbreaks in animal and human populations and to cross significant natural geographic barriers. Rift Valley fever is usually inapparent in non-pregnant adult animals, but pregnant animals and newborns can be severely affected; outbreaks are characterised by a sudden onset of abortions and high neonatal mortality. The majority of human infections are subclinical or associated with moderate to severe, non-fatal, febrile illness, but some patients may develop a haemorrhagic syndrome and/or ocular and neurological lesions. In both animals and humans, the primary site of RVFV replication and tissue pathology is the liver. Outbreaks of RVF are associated with persistent high rainfalls leading to massive flooding and the emergence of large numbers of competent mosquito vectors that transmit the virus to a wide range of susceptible vertebrate species. Outbreaks of RVF have devastating economic effects on countries for which animal trade constitutes the main source of national revenue. The propensity of the virus to spread into new territories and re-emerge in traditionally endemic regions, where it causes large outbreaks in human and animal populations, presents a formidable challenge for public and veterinary health authorities. The presence of competent mosquito vectors in RVF-free countries, the wide range of mammals susceptible to the virus, altering land use, the global changes in climate, and increased animal trade and travel are some of the factors which might contribute to international spread of RVF.

AB  - There were 463,000 head of beef cows in New Mexico as of January 1, 2021 (NASS, 2020), down roughly 4% from 2020 (). Frequent drought often results in herd reduction and loss of valuable genetic progress. Bull selection is critical due to their influence on herd development. A survey was conducted to identify traits important to bull selection in New Mexico. Surveys were collected digitally (n = 83) and via the mail (n = 74). Responses were largely by cow/calf producers averaging 57 +/- 1 years old with 24 +/- 1 years' experience. Survey respondents represented 4,384,296 acres of private owned, private leased, and leased public rangeland and irrigated pasture meadow in New Mexico and surrounding states. Average cow/calf operation size was 294 +/- 39 head and average bull herd size was 21 +/- 3 head. Average price paid for a bull in the past 2 years was $3,981 +/- 213. Physical characteristics, individual bull performance information, and genetic information are all important traits to New Mexico bull buyers; however, most producers (56%) indicated that structural soundness was the most important factor influencing their selection decisions. Amongst expected progeny differences (EPDs), New Mexico producers consider the calving ease direct (CED) and birth weight (BW) EPDS to be most important (40% and 35%, respectively). Producers also indicated that multitrait selection indexes used by the American Angus Association were important to their selection decisions, with the beef value ($B) and weaned calf value ($W) indexes being cited most often (35% and 31%, respectively). Elements important to bull purchase include the bull's sale preview (87%), body condition score (86%), feed efficiency/average daily gain information (85%), and actual scrotal circumference (82%). Following purchase of a new bull, most (60%) keep the bull separate from the cow herd until the following breeding season, while the remaining 40% of producers turn newly purchased bulls out within 30 days of purchase. Sixty eight percent of producers evaluate semen quality annually or prior to the start of the breeding season. Interestingly, 39% of producers indicated they used reproductive technologies like artificial insemination and synchronization of estrus while most (80%) test for trichomoniasis. The primary factor influencing culling decisions is age, followed by soundness and fertility.

AB  - We studied survival of radiocollared elk (Cervus claphus) calves in Yellowstone National Park from 1987 to 1990, and survival of calves computed from population estimates from 1968 to 1992, We hypothesized that summer and winter survival of elk calves and mass of neonates were inversely related to population size, measures of environmental severity, and timing of births. Herd-wide survival estimates based on winter counts, reported harvests, and herd classifications, suggested that winter survival of elk calves was related inversely to estimated size of the elk population during winter (P = 0.0002), but we found no correlation with an index of winter severity (P = 0.51). Summer survival of elk calves also was correlated inversely with the estimated size of the elk population the previous winter (P = 0.03), Summer survival of radiocollared calves averaged 0.65 (n = 127 marked calves) from 1987 to 1990, the losses mostly due to predation (22%). Winter survival of calves averaged 0.72 (n = 88 marked calves entered the winter period), with losses due mostly to malnutrition (58%). Summer survival of radiocollared calves was positively correlated with estimated birth weight (P = 0.001). Survival of radiocollared calves during winters 1987-90 was correlated positively with early calving and mildness of the winter (in contrast to herd-wide survival estimates), and was inversely correlated with estimated elk population size that winter (P = 0.006). Winter survival of radiocollared calves was lower during 1988-89 following the drought and large fires than the other 3 winters (P < 0.001). Predation on elk calves during summer doubled after the drought and fires of 1968 (13% calf losses to predation before the fires vs. 29% after the fires). Potential compensation existed between components of calf mortality: predators killed more light (P = 0.041) and more late born calves (P = 0.146); calves were born later and lighter (P = 0.048) following severe weather conditions; and heavier born calves survived at a higher rate (P = 0.006). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that density-dependent mortality of calves during winter due to malnutrition, and summer mortality of calves due to predation were partially compensatory but severe environmental conditions produced largely additive components to both summer (increased predation) and winter (increased malnutrition) mortality.

AB  - Inspired by F. ULMER'S (1935/1942) studies of rural exodus, H. WOPFNER and H. KINZL (University of Innsbruck) started examining population problems in the Alpine mountainous areas using parish registers as a source for profound studies of some demographic-biological problems. Supervised by H. KINZL himself and his successors at the Geographical Institute, about 50 undergraduates wrote papers on this subject, having collected more than 1.3 million records of marriages, births and deaths in 180 communes in western Austria.
   H. KINZL (1898-1979) had intended to publish a summary of this research work, but did not realize his plan. Consequently only a small portion of his extensive life's work can be found in various publications, mainly in the ''Geographische Jahresberichte aus Osterreich'' and the ''Bergbauernbuch'' (H. WOPFNER 1951/ 1960). In 1973 H. BOBEK and in 1975 E. LICHTENBERGER praised the Innsbruck school of population geography but did not provide a synthesis. In the 1992-1994 period the present author published a few studies in the ''Tiroler Chronist'' that were later used by E. STEINICKE (1996) in his paper on teaching and research into population geography in Innsbruck.
   Whereas the early papers by undergraduates show a rather unreflected approach to the sources, later papers increasingly take a more critical view as to the value of the sources. Nevertheless, on the whole the papers convey a correct picture of the rural society from the 17th up to the 19th century. No first marriage in church was possible without the consent of the independent communes, and permission was only granted if sufficient means for keeping a family could be presumed. Therefore, marriage age was high (33 years for men, 30 for women - sometimes even 40 and 35) because normally couples had to wait until after the death of their parents before being able to marry. The average fertile period was 14 years with 5,5 births, the mortality rate of children up to the age of 5 was 24% and maternal mortality 1.5%. In spite of a surplus in the number of births during the past 300 years the population figure remained stable. A study of the balance of births and deaths suggests that one fourth of all children born emigrated later on, thus preventing overcrowding.
   There is no demographic difference between the western area with a division of properties (based on Roman law) and the eastern area with ''indivisible'' farms (based on German law). In the west only 5% of the children were illegitimate as illegitimacy was disapproved of not only by the community and the church but by the families living on small farms as well. In the east, the illegitimacy rate is at least 10%, regionally even 50%, as divorces were prohibited, a sort of insurance for possible infertility of the brides and the need for labour on large farms. Relief and traffic conditions limited the range of marriages. In the main valleys, marriages between persons related by blood at 2nd and 3rd degree amount to less than 1%, whereas in isolated valleys high up the proportion is almost 30%. In the 19th century, the avarage interval between births dropped from 26 to 17 months and infant mortality rose to 30% or more, probably caused by a worsening of the agricultural conditions, more work for women and the giving up of breastfeeding. In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries the number of deaths caused by diseases seems to be ten times greater than that caused by natural hazards (inundations, avalanches, landslides, debris-flows etc).

AB  - Pakistan has third highest burden of maternal and children mortality across the globe. This grim situation is further intensified by flaws of planning and implementation set forth in health sector. Natural calamities (earth quakes, floods), disease outbreaks and lack of awareness in different regions of country also further aggravate this situation. Despite of all these limitations, under the banner of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) a special focus and progress in addressing maternal health issue (set as goal 5) has been made over the last decade. In this review, improvement and short falls pertaining to Goal 5 Improve maternal health have been analyzed in relation to earlier years. A decline in maternal mortality ratio (MMR) (490 maternal deaths in 1990 to 260 maternal deaths per 100,000 women in 2010) is observed. Reduction in MMR by three quarters was not achieved but a decline from very high mortality to high mortality index was observed. Increase usage of contraceptives (with contraceptive prevalence rate of 11.8 in 1990 to 37 in 2013) also shed light on women awareness about their health and social issues. Based on progress level assessment (WHO guidelines),access of Pakistani women to universal reproductive health unit falls in moderate category in 2010 as compared to earlier low access in 1990. From the data it looks that still a lot of effort is required for achieving the said targets. However, keeping in view all challenges, Pakistan suffered in the said duration, like volatile peace, regional political instability, policy implementation constrains, population growth, this slow but progressive trend highlight a national resilience to address the havoc challenge of maternal health.These understandings and sustained efforts will significantly contribute a best possible accomplishment in Millennium Development Goal 5 by 2015.

AB  - In our current climate of rapid technological progress, it seems counterintuitive to think that modern science can learn anything of ethical value from the dark recesses of the nineteenth century or earlier. However, this happens to be quite true, with plenty of knowledge and wisdom to be gleaned by studying our scientific predecessors. Presently, our journals are flooded with original concepts and potential breakthroughs, a continuous stream of ideas pushing the frontiers of knowledge ever forward. Some ideas flourish while others flounder; but what sets the two apart? The distinguishing feature between success and failure within this context is the ability to discern the appropriate time to accept an innovation with open arms, versus when to take a more cautious approach. And the primary arbiters for whether an idea will catch on or not are the professional audience. I illustrate this concept by comparing the initial reception of two innovative ideas from Medicine's past: sterile technique, and prefrontal lobotomy. Sterile technique was first introduced by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis and was initially ridiculed and rejected, with Semmelweis eventually dying in exile. Conversely, lobotomy was accepted and lauded and its inventor, Dr. Egas Moniz, won the Nobel Prize for his "discovery". This begs the question: why was a technique with the potential to save millions of lives initially rejected, whereas paradoxically, one that compromised and sometimes destroyed lives, accepted? Here I explore and analyze the potential reasons why, suggest how we can learn from these mistakes of the past and apply new insight to some current ethical dilemmas.

AB  - The effects of natural and technological disasters on human, the environment, economy and social life can be prevented via scientific and technological developments. Especially, international scientific studies provide a better understanding of the nature, characteristics and effects of di-sasters. Therefore, a more resilient community can be built after disasters by reducing the damages of disasters at national and international level. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the disaster resilience of countries. In this study, by analyzing the data of 181 countries in 2018 and 2019, the rate of total population affected by disasters was employed as dependent variable and the factors indicating the development level of countries as independent variables. The data were analyzed with the help of ArcGIS 10.7 program using ordinary least squares regression analysis that reveals general relationships and geographical weighted regres-sion analysis that shows local relationships across study area. In conclusion, in the general model, compulsory education duration in 2018 was the only variable that positively and significantly predicted the rate of total population affected by disasters. While neonatal mortality rate and unemployment predicted positively and significantly the rate of total population affected by di-sasters in 2019, urban population rate predicted negatively and significantly. The effect of all the independent variables on the rate of total population affected by disasters differed depending on time and region. The result of this study is expected to contribute to the national and international organizations responsible for disaster risk reduction efforts to prepare more effective and efficient disaster plans. In addition, the method and approach of this study may give an idea to scientists investigating on disasters.

AB  - Once a humanitarian disaster receives coverage in the global media, the international community usually mobilises to reduce the most severe consequences. However people in Chad are experiencing endemic crises that are detached from specific triggers, and they are not receiving any international assistance to help relieve the hardships they face. This study involves 111 migrant households from central Chad that, as a result of war and drought, have lost everything and now have to live in squatter areas of N'Djamena and Mongo, facing uncertainty and threats while negotiating their livelihoods. Qualitative and quantitative methods have been combined in this study to reveal the intriguing story of their daily lives in the face of complex and endemic crises. Anthropometric and health data were generated to determine the nutritional status of mothers and their children under five. Life histories, in-depth interviews and participatory observation allowed the researchers to capture the negotiation strategies they use to access food and shelter, their experiences of food insecurity and sanitary vulnerability, and the consequences these have on daily life. Results indicate that 62% of households were female headed, there were high rates of acute (40-50%) and chronic (35-40%) malnutrition and 46% of the mothers were underweight and anaemic. Infant mortality rates were also high at 30%-42% and 97% of the children had had incomplete or no vaccinations. No households had access to clean water, sanitation or public-health services. Endemic corruption and abuse by the authorities were identified as major sources of day-to-day insecurity. These migrants were not expecting any improvement in their livelihoods in the foreseeable future and saw these miserable conditions as normal.

AB  - Maize is a potential crop for improving food and nutritional security for over 300 million people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is the most preferred cereal crop in SSA because of its diversified uses, taste and higher grain yield potential compared to other cereals. However, overdependence on maize-based diets without vitamin A supplementation is associated with the highest rates of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in SSA. Vitamin A deficiency mostly affects children under the age of 5 years, pregnant and lactating women, accounting for the worst disease burden, and infant mortality in SSA. To date provitamin A maize breeding programmes of HarvestPlus partnered with CIMMYT and IITA, private seed companies and national plant breeding programmes developed at least 70 elite varieties to curb VAD in SSA. This review summarizes the potential of provitamin A maize in SSA focusing on (1) reasons why maize is a good choice for provitamin A biofortification, (2) the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in SSA, (3) the Global Hunger Index (GHI) and extent of hidden hunger, (4) possible interventions to curb vitamin A deficiency in SSA and their applicability, (5) status of the provitamin A maize varieties released, (6) level of adoption and consumer perception of provitamin A maize-based food, (7) the impact of climate change in maize productivity in SSA and (8) the breeding methods for developing provitamin A maize-resilient genotypes to mitigate the effects of climate change in SSA.

AB  - Haiti's surgical capacity was significantly strained by the 2010 earthquake. As the government and its partners rebuild the health system, emergency and essential surgical care must be a priority.
   A validated, facility-based assessment tool developed by WHO was completed by 45 hospitals nationwide. The hospitals were assessed for (1) infrastructure, (2) human resources, (3) surgical interventions and emergency care, and (4) material resources for resuscitation. Fisher's exact test was used to compare hospitals by sectors: public compared to private and mixed (public-private partnerships).
   The 45 hospitals included first-referral level to the national referral hospital: 20 were public sector and 25 were private or mixed sector. Blood banks (33 % availability) and oxygen concentrators (58 %) were notable infrastructural deficits. For human resources, 69 % and 33 % of hospitals employed at least one full-time surgeon and anaesthesiologist, respectively. Ninety-eight percent of hospitals reported capacity to perform resuscitation. General and obstetrical surgical interventions were relatively more available, for example 93 % provided hernia repairs and 98 % provided cesarean sections. More specialized interventions were at a deficit: cataract surgery (27 %), cleft repairs (31 %), clubfoot (42 %), and open treatment of fractures (51 %).
   Deficiencies in infrastructure and material resources were widespread and should be urgently addressed. Physician providers were mal-distributed relative to non-physician providers. Formal task-sharing to midlevel and general physician providers should be considered. The parity between public and private or mixed sector hospitals in availability of Ob/Gyn surgical interventions is evidence of concerted efforts to reduce maternal mortality. This ought to provide a roadmap for strengthening of surgical care capacity.

AB  - Forest and vegetation fires are major sources of air pollution and have triggered air quality issues in many regions of Asia. Measures to reduce fires may be a significant yet under-recognized option for efficiently improving air quality and preventing related premature deaths. Here we isolate fire-specific fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from monitoring concentrations using an observation-driven approach in the region. Fire-specific PM2.5 concentrations average 2-15 mu g m-3 during the fire season, with higher values in Southeast Asia (SEA), Northeast Asia (NEA), and northern India. The total PM2.5 in the Asia Pacific region exhibits a rapid declining trend from 2014 to 2021, while fire-specific PM2.5 decreases in early years but begins to reverse in SEA and NEA. The proportions of fire-specific PM2.5 increase in NEA from 0.2 to 0.3 during the fire season and increase in SEA from 0.2 in 2018 to 0.4 in 2021. Fire-specific PM2.5 exposure caused 58 000 (95 % confidence interval (CI) of 32 600-82 600), 90 000 (95 % CI of 63 700-106 000), 157 000 (95 % CI of 110 000-186 000), and 29 300 (95 % CI of 18 000-39 700) premature deaths annually in SEA, East Asia (EA), Central Asia (CA), and NEA, respectively, accounting for 40.9 % (95 % CI of 22.8 %-57.7 %), 14.9 % (95 % CI of 10.5 %-17.6 %), 19.4 % (95 % CI of 13.5 %-24.5 %), and 24.1 % (95 % CI of 14.8 %-32.5 %) of the numbers caused by the total PM2.5. Analysis of infant mortality rate data and PM2.5 exposure indicates that the total PM2.5 exposure had a greater impact in richer areas, while fire-specific PM2.5 exposure affected more populations in poorer regions. Based on the positive correlation between vapor pressure deficit and fire-specific PM2.5, this study suggests that, without further regulation and policy intervention, the emerging growth trend of fire-specific PM2.5 in the Asia Pacific region is likely to continue under the influence of future climate change.

Problems that have plagued the process of referral include poor service quality, low availability of trained personnel, inadequate supplies of drugs and medical diagnostic equipment and inadequate communication infrastructure. In this paper, the authors analyse the role of transport costs in the utilization of referral and how community health insurance schemes can help reduce the economic burden of transport costs, thereby improving referral utilization and health outcomes. Following the introduction, the authors provide a conceptual framework of the individual; household- and community-level factors that affect referral in the rural African context, with particular emphasis on the role of the time and monetary costs of transport and the potential role of community risk-sharing schemes. The paper then presents a detailed case study from Kenya where a community has been experimenting with a health insurance scheme which provides emergency transport for emergency referral. Data from the past eight years of experience in northern Kenya suggests that support for the insurance scheme has depended on the reliability of the health system, as well as the seasons and Various external problems, such as political interference, drought and insecurity. Conclusions drawn support the idea of community financing schemes for transport, not merely as a lifesaving strategy in remote and resource-poor health infrastructures, but also as a means to help build trust in the health system itself and thus improve sustainability through local institutional support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The periods of fetal and child development arguably represent the stages of greatest vulnerability to the dual impacts of fossil fuel combustion: the multiple toxic effects of emitted pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particles, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, metals) and the broad health impacts of global climate change attributable in large part to carbon dioxide released by fossil fuel burning.
   OBJECTIVES: In this commentary I highlight current scientific evidence indicating that the fetus and young child are at heightened risk of developmental impairment, asthma, and cancer from fossil fuel pollutants and from the predicted effects of climate disruption such as heat waves, flooding, infectious disease, malnutrition, and trauma. Increased risk during early development derives from the inherently greater biologic vulnerability of the developing fetus and child and from their long future lifetime, during which early insults can potentially manifest as adult as well as childhood disease. I cite recent reports concluding that reducing dependence on fossil fuel and promoting clean and sustainable energy is economically feasible.
   DISCUSSION: Although much has been written separately about the toxicity of fossil fuel burning emissions and the effects of climate change on health, these two faces of the problem have not been viewed together with a focus on the developing fetus and child. Adolescence and old age are also periods of vulnerability, but the potential for both immediate and long-term adverse effects is greatest when exposure occurs prenatally or in the early years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Consideration of the full spectrum of health risks to children from fossil fuel combustion underscores the urgent need for environmental and energy policies to reduce fossil fuel dependence and maximize the health benefits to this susceptible population. We do not have to leave our children a double legacy of ill health and ecologic disaster.

AB  - The elemental halogens include chlorine, bromine, and phosgene. Halogen gas can be directly weaponized and employed in warfare or terrorism. Industrial stockpiles or halogen transport can provide targets for terrorist attack as well as an origin for accidental release creating a risk for potential mass-casualty incidents. Pregnant and post-partum women represent a substantial and vulnerable subset of the population who may be at particular risk during an attack or accidental exposure. We review the effects of halogen exposure on the parturient with a focus on bromine toxicity. Bromine is the most extensively studied agent in the context of pregnancy and to-date murine models form the basis for the majority of current knowledge. Pregnancy potentiates the acute lung injury after halogen exposure. In addition, halogen exposure precipitates a preeclamptic-like syndrome in mice. This phenotype is characterized by systemic and pulmonary hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, decreased cardiac output, placental injury and fetal growth restriction. This constellation contributes to increased maternal and fetal mortality observed after bromine exposure. Angiogenic imbalance is noted with overexpression of the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) form of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 reminiscent of human preeclampsia. Additional research is needed to further explore the effect of halogen gas exposure in pregnancy and to develop therapeutic interventions to mitigate risk to this unique population.

AB  - Stocking rate is generally considered to be the most important management factor in sustainable grazing of Great Plains grasslands over management periods of 10 to 20 years or longer. Most studies to determine optimum stocking rates have compared only 2 or 3 discrete stocking rates. Our objective was to determine cow, calf, and economic performance on sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia Torr.) rangeland as a continuous function of stocking rate. Replicated stocking rates of 0.11, 0.15, and 0.22 head ha(-1) were studied over an 8-year period. Cow weight declined as stocking rate increased in drought years but was not affected by stocking rate in wetter years. Weaning percentage was not affected by stocking rate but variation within treatment groups was high. Calf birth weight and weaning weight both declined as stocking rate increased. Comparing 0.11 and 0.22 head ha(-1), calf production cow(-1) declined from 206 to 144 kg cow(-1) as stocking rate increased but calf production ha(-1) increased from 22.6 to 31.7 kg calf ha(-1). Net returns were maximized at $7.87 ha(-1) year(-1) at a stocking rate of 0.172 head ha(-1), well within the range of experimental treatments. Net returns were within 5% of maximum between stocking rates of 0.156 and 0.183 head ha(-1). The variability of all responses increased as stocking rate increased. Simulation indicated-that improved livestock prices and increased animal productivity shifted the economic optimum stocking rate to higher levels, which would put more pressure on the conservation ethic of land managers.

AB  - The effects of feeding lucerne hay (Medicago sativa) and or barley grain to grazing reproducing Angora does on birth weight, live weight, body condition, quality and production of milk and mohair and gastrointestinal parasitism were investigated in does and kids. The design was supplementation for the last 8 weeks prepartum to 8 weeks postpartum with 5 levels of whole barley grain (GL: 0, 115, 230, 345, 460 g/d/doe) x 2 levels of hay supplementation (HL, 380 g/d/doe 8 weeks prepartum, 0 g/d postpartum; HH, 830 g/d/doe 8 weeks prepartum, 800 g/d/doe 8 weeks postpartum) x 2 randomised blocks. This provided 20 experimental plots, 10 for each level of hay and 4 for each GL. Each plot contained one dry doe, three single litter does, and one twin litter doe. Pastoral conditions were poor with low availability of green pasture until late spring. Does kidded in early August. Important results were: GL affected kid live weight, milk production, composition and secretion of milk solids, total mohair production and some mohair quality measures but GL increased fibre diameter and incidence of medullated fibres in kid mohair; optimum performance at day 40 of lactation was GL 345 which produced 2325 g/d milk corrected to 4% fat. HH increased secretion of milk protein and total solids compared with HL. Twin litters had greater persistence in lactation to day 100 of lactation compared with single litters. There was evidence that high levels of barley feeding reduced faecal egg count. Dry does gained more live weight, grew 26 % more mohair which was 1.7 mu m coarser compared with does with single litter. The results indicate that feeding lucerne hay even under adverse seasonal conditions was of little value. The lactation performance of these grazing Angora does was substantially less than their potential. Optimum barley feeding was GL 345 g/d/doe. There was evidence of substitution of pasture for hay. The results quantified the production responses and penalties of Angora does when litter size was increased from non-pregnant status (zero) to 2.

AB  - Purpose: Maternal mortality in Malawi is high, with low coverage of maternity care being a contributing factor. To improve maternal health coverage, an Android-based, integrated mobile health (mHealth) app called YendaNafe was introduced to community health workers (CHWs) in the Neno district, rural Malawi. This study evaluates the impact of this app on the uptake of antenatal care (ANC), facility-based births, and postnatal care (PNC), compared to a reference period where CHWs provided the same services without mHealth, using the interrupted time series analysis. Patients and Methods: Using aggregated monthly data and segmented quasi-Poisson regression models, we compared the effects of mHealth on selected maternal health outcomes. The models were adjusted for the COVID-19 pandemic, the occurrence of cyclones, and a cholera epidemic. We analyzed data from six eligible health facilities and their respective catchment areas in which CHWs were using YendaNafe, and compared 12 months before and 12 months after its introduction. Results: The use of YendaNafe was associated with a 22% immediate increase in facility-based births (aIRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12-1.33, p<0.001) but not an immediate increase in new ANC visits (aIRR 1.02,95% CI 0.90-1.14, p=0.77), ANC in the first trimester (aIRR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95-1.45 p=0.13), or PNC visits (aIRR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79-1.36, p=0.81). For long-term effect, YendaNafe was associated with an increase in new ANC visits (aIRR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, p <0.01) and ANC in the first trimester (aIRR 1.03,95% CI 1.00-1.07 p=0.046), but not facility-based births (aIRR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99-1.03, p=0.46) or PNC (aIRR 0.97 95% CI 0.93-1.01, p=0.14). Conclusion: mHealth shows potential of increasing utilization of new ANC visits, ANC in the first trimester and facility-based births. Further research is needed to understand why mHealth did not have an effect on PNC.

AB  - In recent years, investigators have noted a trend toward a declining proportion of male births in many industrialized nations. While men bear the sex-determining chromosome, the role of the female partner as it pertains to fertilization or miscarriage may also alter the gender ratio. We attempted to determine a man's secondary sex ratio (F1 generation) by directly examining the sex chromosomes of his sperm. We examined our male infertility clinic database for all men who had undergone a semen fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Patient demographic and semen parameters were recorded. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare gender ratios (Y chromosomes/total chromosomes). Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict the odds of possessing a Y-bearing sperm after accounting for demographic and semen parameters. A total of 185 men underwent sperm FISH. For the entire cohort, the proportion of Y chromosome-bearing sperm was 51.5%. Men with less than five million motile sperm had a significantly lower proportion of Y chromosome-bearing sperm (50.8%) compared to men with higher sperm counts (51.6%; P=0.02). After multivariable adjustment, a higher sperm concentration, total motile sperm count and semen volume significantly increased the odds of having a Y chromosome-bearing sperm (P<0.01). As a man's sperm production declines, so does the proportion of Y chromosome-bearing sperm. Thus, a man's reproductive potential may predict his ability to sire male offspring.

AB  - Many nations now export military health as a proactive arm of the nation's contribution to the maintenance of international peace in troubled regions of the world; and all nations are called upon from time to time in emergency and disaster situations to help out in their regions of interest. Children and young teenagers constitute some 50% of war-stricken populations. This paper explores this increasingly important role of military medicine from the point of view of a practicing pediatrician and career doctor-soldier. Many international operational deployments undertaken in the last 5 years have required the insertion of pediatric clinical and preventive health resources. Deployments to Rwanda, the countries of the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Bougainville (in Papua New Guinea), Irian Jaya (in Indonesia), and the Aitape tsunami disaster response (the Sepik region of Papua New Guinea) have all necessitated major pediatric interventions. In some operational deployments, in excess of one-third of patient and clinical contacts have involved the care of children, including clinical treatments ranging from life-saving resuscitation to the care of children with both tropical and subtropical illnesses. They have also involved mass immunization campaigns (e.g., in Rwanda) to prevent measles and meningococcal septicemia. In developing countries, at any time approximately 1 in 4 teenage and adult women is pregnant; and of these, 1 in 15 is suffering a miscarriage during any 2-week period. The implications of this audit are that service members must be multiskilled not only in the traditional aspects of military medicine and nursing but also in (a) the developmental aspects of childhood; (b) the prevention of infectious childhood diseases by immunization and other means; (c) the recognition and management of diseases of childhood; and (d) the management of the normal neonate and infant, especially those orphaned in refugee, disaster, and other emergency situations. Doctor-soldiers hold special credentials to be advocates for the protection of children caught up in armed conflict and its aftermath. In this context, advocacy to ban antipersonnel land mines is topical, because unfortunately the more than 2,000 deaths and injuries each month involve children and their families, often injured long after the cessation of hostilities. Pediatric issues are now the business of all who serve in the health disciplines in the broader profession of arms.

AB  - Background: Several non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are promoting the use of Artemisia annua teas as a home-based treatment for malaria in situations where conventional treatments are not available. There has been controversy about the effectiveness and safety of this approach, but no pharmacovigilance studies or evaluations have been published to date.
   Method: A questionnaire about the cultivation of A. annua, treatment of patients, and side-effects observed, was sent to partners of the NGO Anamed in Kenya and Uganda. Some of the respondents were then selected purposively for more in-depth semi-structured interviews.
   Results: Eighteen partners in Kenya and 21 in Uganda responded. 49% reported difficulties in growing the plant, mainly due to drought. Overall about 3,000 cases of presumed malaria had been treated with A. annua teas in the previous year, of which about 250 were in children and 54 were in women in the first trimester of pregnancy. The commonest problem observed in children was poor compliance due to the bitter taste, which was improved by the addition of sugar or honey. Two miscarriages were reported in pregnant patients. Only four respondents reported side-effects in other patients, the commonest of which was vomiting. 51% of respondents had started using A. annua tea to treat illnesses other than malaria.
   Conclusions: Local cultivation and preparation of A. annua are feasible where growing conditions are appropriate. Few adverse events were reported even in children and pregnant women. Where ACT is in short supply, it would make sense to save it for young children, while using A. annua infusions to treat older patients who are at lower risk. An ongoing pharmacovigilance system is needed to facilitate reporting of any adverse events.

AB  - The climate crisis poses major challenges to reproductive justice. Climate-related events and natural disasters are severely impacting sexual and reproductive rights as well as the ability of individuals to become parents and care for their children. Through a systematic review conducted using the PRISMA method, this article addresses the impact of the climate crisis on the three core principles of reproductive justice: (1) the right not to have a child; (2) the right to have a child; and (3) the right to parent children in safe and healthy environments. While the review found no empirical studies addressing how the climate crisis impacts the right not to have children, the findings suggest that hurricanes, floods, heatwaves, droughts, and coastal erosion are associated with greater intentions of remaining childless and having fewer children, increasing fetal mortality and preterm births, decreasing new-born sex ratios and birth weight, rising birth risks, declining birth rates, and increasing challenges to parenting and childcare. We argue that the climate crisis fundamentally undermines reproductive justice by preventing individuals from fully and equitably exercising their reproductive rights to have children and to parent in safe and sustainable environments. In doing so, we stress that the climate crisis should be considered when addressing the challenges of reproductive justice and that addressing these challenges requires implementing policies that not only seek to mitigate the effects of climate disruptions but also strengthen the capacity of individuals and communities to adapt to changing environmental conditions, ensuring more sustainable reproductive futures.
   La crise climatique pose des d & eacute;fis majeurs & agrave; la justice reproductive. Les catastrophes naturelles et les & eacute;v & eacute;nements li & eacute;s au climat ont de graves cons & eacute;quences sur les droits sexuels et reproductifs ainsi que sur la capacit & eacute; des individus & agrave; devenir parents et & agrave; s'occuper de leurs enfants. Avec un examen syst & eacute;matique men & eacute; selon la m & eacute;thode PRISMA, cet article & eacute;tudie l'impact de la crise climatique sur les trois principes fondamentaux de la justice reproductive: (1) le droit de ne pas avoir d'enfant; (2) le droit d'avoir des enfants; et (3) le droit d'& eacute;lever ses enfants dans un environnement s & ucirc;r et sain. Bien que l'examen n'ait trouv & eacute; aucune & eacute;tude empirique portant sur l'influence de la crise climatique sur le droit de ne pas avoir d'enfant, les r & eacute;sultats sugg & egrave;rent que les ouragans, les inondations, les vagues de chaleur, les s & eacute;cheresses et l'& eacute;rosion c & ocirc;ti & egrave;re sont associ & eacute;s & agrave; une intention plus marqu & eacute;e de ne pas avoir d'enfant et d'en avoir moins, & agrave; une augmentation de la mortalit & eacute; f oe tale et des naissances pr & eacute;matur & eacute;es, & agrave; une diminution du rapport de masculinit & eacute; et du poids des nouveau-n & eacute;s & agrave; la naissance, & agrave; une augmentation des risques & agrave; l'accouchement, & agrave; une baisse des taux de natalit & eacute; et & agrave; une multiplication des difficult & eacute;s en mati & egrave;re de parentalit & eacute; et d'& eacute;ducation des enfants. Nous estimons que la crise climatique sape fondamentalement la justice reproductive en emp & ecirc;chant les individus d'exercer pleinement et & eacute;quitablement leurs droits reproductifs d'avoir des enfants et de les & eacute;lever dans un environnement s & ucirc;r et durable. Ce faisant, nous soulignons que la crise climatique doit & ecirc;tre prise en compte dans la r & eacute;solution des probl & egrave;mes li & eacute;s & agrave; la justice reproductive, et que s'attaquer & agrave; ces d & eacute;fis suppose la mise en oe uvre de politiques cherchant non seulement & agrave; att & eacute;nuer les effets des d & eacute;r & egrave;glements climatiques, mais aussi & agrave; renforcer la capacit & eacute; des individus et des communaut & eacute;s & agrave; s'adapter aux changements environnementaux, garantissant ainsi un avenir reproductif plus durable.
   La crisis clim & aacute;tica presenta grandes retos a la justicia reproductiva. Los fen & oacute;menos meteorol & oacute;gicos y los desastres naturales tienen un impacto grave en los derechos sexuales y reproductivos, as & iacute; como en la capacidad de las personas para ser padres y cuidar a sus hijos. Por medio de una revisi & oacute;n sistem & aacute;tica que realizamos utilizando el m & eacute;todo PRISMA, este art & iacute;culo aborda el impacto de la crisis clim & aacute;tica en los tres principios fundamentales de la justicia reproductiva: (1) el derecho a no tener hijos; (2) el derecho a tener hijos; y (3) el derecho a criar los hijos en entornos seguros y sanos. Aunque la revisi & oacute;n no encontr & oacute; ning & uacute;n estudio emp & iacute;rico que aborde c & oacute;mo la crisis clim & aacute;tica afecta el derecho de no tener hijos, los hallazgos indican que los huracanes, las inundaciones, las olas de calor, las sequ & iacute;as y la erosi & oacute;n costera est & aacute;n asociados con mayores intenciones de no tener hijos o de tener menos hijos, mayores tasas de mortalidad fetal y nacimientos prematuros, menores tasas de masculinidad de reci & eacute;n nacidos, bajo peso al nacer, crecientes riesgos en el parto, tasas de natalidad en descenso y crecientes retos para criar y cuidar a los hijos. Argumentamos que la crisis clim & aacute;tica socava fundamentalmente la justicia reproductiva al impedir que las personas ejerzan plena y equitativamente sus derechos reproductivos a tener hijos y criarlos en entornos seguros y sostenibles. Hacemos hincapi & eacute; en que se debe tomar en consideraci & oacute;n la crisis clim & aacute;tica al afrontar los retos de la justicia reproductiva, y que para abordar estos retos es necesario aplicar pol & iacute;ticas que no solo busquen mitigar los efectos de las perturbaciones clim & aacute;ticas, sino que tambi & eacute;n refuercen la capacidad de las personas y las comunidades para adaptarse a las condiciones ambientales cambiantes y as & iacute; garantizar futuros reproductivos m & aacute;s sostenibles.

AB  - Objectives To examine increases in several health outcomes after the July 22, 2011 terrorist attacks in Norway.
   Methods Retrospective analysis of nationwide registers (n = 4,953,000) where incidences of schizophrenia/psychosis hospitalizations, suicides, acute myocardial infarctions, and preterm births after the terrorist attacks were compared with corresponding periods the previous 3 years.
   Results Compared with the same period the preceding 3 years, the observed number of hospitalizations from schizophrenia/psychosis was 14% higher during the first 4 weeks after the terrorist attack (incidence ratio [IR] = 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-1.21). The corresponding IRs for the first 3 days and the first week were 1.26 (95% CI = 0.99-1.58) and 1.10 (95% CI = 0.96-1.24). The observed number of suicides was increased by 45% the first 4 weeks (IR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.12-1.86), 163% the first 3 days (IR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.15-5.20), and 105% the first week (IR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.14-3.42). For acute myocardial infarction, there was an increase of 5% the first 4 weeks. There were also more births the 4 weeks (IR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01-1.07, but this increase was not seen in preterm births of less than 37 weeks of gestation (IR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.83-1.04).
   Conclusions We observed a general nationwide increase of health outcomes investigated in this study the first 4 weeks after the terrorist attacks. These results may contribute to the growing body of evidence on the adverse health outcomes that may accompany national stressors.

AB  - In this work occurs the relationship between some productive parameters and classification of bovine carcasses of Venezuela and the European Union, for Brahman males castrated to birth, their own environment in intensive system in the Llano Venezuelan, depending on your time of birth (dry or wet), as well as the relationship between the two systems. It was controlled weight at birth, weight and age at weaning, weight and age to slaughter, weight during the fattening and the performance gain carcass, 1478 castrated to the birth of Brahman, 750 males born between the months of June and July (rainy season) and 728 born between the months of January and February (time of drought). All the carcasses were classified according to the Venezuelan system and the European Union for bovine animals. The effect of the time of birth influenced significantly the growth of animals, although there was no difference in the weight at birth, if there was at weaning weight (194.14 vs. 177.55) and the slaughter (503.17 vs. 493.01), for those born in dry season. The time of birth did not influence the classification of carcasses, finding AA-optimal class according to the Venezuelan system, E-excellent and U-very well for the EU to the conformation and good fat content (3-covered) according to the system of the EU system carcass. Regardless of the time of birth, it was found for both, the Venezuelan and EU classification, greater slaughter weight as well as higher gain weight and killing out percentage involved positively with superior carcasses ratings. Found a high correlation between the Venezuelan system and the EU (0.92 for conformation and 0.94 for fat content), in both times of birth, so that better classified carcasses as Venezuela system they are also best classifications according to the EU system.

AB  - For almost five decades, the US Supreme Court had protected the right to abortion care in the United States. However, the Court's decision in 'Dobbs versus Jackson Women's Health Organization' in 2022 established that the US Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, effectively overturning the Court's own previous judgment in 'Roe versus Wade' from 1973. How could a decision that overturns the precedent for nationwide access to abortion affect women, children, and physicians? How will state laws impact healthcare equity regarding reproductive rights going forward? How will geography affect who can access care financially, and how will this shape the conditions that unwanted children are born into? This work is a systematic analysis of the impact of overturning 'Roe versus Wade' considering the scientific and medical evidence as well as the conflicting political and moral viewpoints regarding abortion. Furthermore, we make constructive recommendations with a view to detoxifying the inflammatory rhetoric surrounding this topic and protecting key stakeholders such as patients seeking abortion and their physicians.The moment 'Roe v. Wade' was overturned, several US states began to enact laws, both protecting and restricting abortion. California and New York, for example, have since enacted laws that extend protection to both patients seeking abortion and the physicians who provide it. Oklahoma and Texas, on the other hand, have enacted laws that make it more difficult for patients to have abortion access, even after fetal death or when the birthing individual's life is in danger. These differences are likely to exacerbate the healthcare access divide across the country and increase the financial burden for those who can become pregnant. As differences in healthcare access and quality of care increase across the nation, an unmatched demand for maternity care, especially in the most restrictive states, could precipitate increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality while physician shortages are expected to worsen. It will be up to the US Congress to address these differences while weighing competing stakeholder interests. Currently, the nation is at the center of a seismic shift surrounding health policy with laws changing rapidly. This systematic health policy analysis paper will explore what the long-term consequences of this recent Supreme Court decision might look like while considering some of the most recently reported short-term consequences after the landslide decision.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared, in a prospective, randomized clinical trial, the subjective and objective outcomes after primary anal sphincter overlap or approximation repair of third-degree obstetric tears.
   STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective, randomized clinical trial at our university teaching hospital, we studied 112 primiparous women who sustained a third-degree tear during a 1-year period (July 1998-June 1999); they were randomly selected, at diagnosis, to receive either an overlap or an approximation repair. Obstetric personnel, trained in both methods, carried out the repairs immediately after delivery. Fifty-five women under went an overlap procedure, and 57 women underwent an approximation repair. Outcome measures assessed were symptoms of fecal incontinence, abnormal findings on anal manometry, and abnormal findings on endoanal ultrasonography at 3 months post partum.
   RESULTS: Obstetric factors, including mode of delivery, birth weight, duration of labor, and episiotomy incidence, did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Experience of the operator, analgesia used, and place of repair were similar in both groups, The median incontinence scores were 0/20 after overlap repair and 2/20 after approximation repair (difference not significant). Eleven women (20%) complained of fecal urgency after overlap repair, in comparison with 17 (30%) after approximation repair (difference not significant). There were no significant differences in either anal manometry or endoanal ultrasonographic results between the 2 groups. Six women (11%) had a significant (>1 quadrant) anal sphincter defect after primary overlap repair, compared with 3 (5%) after approximation repair (difference not significant). Overall, 66% of women had ultrasonographic evidence of a residual full-thickness defect in the external anal sphincter after primary repair.
   CONCLUSION: The outcome after primary repair of third-degree obstetric tear was similar whether an approximation or an overlap technique was used. Overall symptomatic outcome was flood, although two thirds of women had ultrasonographic evidence of residual anal sphincter damage irrespective of the method of repair.

AB  - A large persistent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in a symptomatic premature or newborn infant is to be regarded as an expression of the premature birth, which must per se be primarily treated. The PDA may persist, however, despite optimal neonatological therapy and specific pharmacological intervention, as a hemodynamically relevant connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery stem. In this case the clinical symptoms depend on the extent of the shunt and pulmonary flooding or pulmonary pressure elevation and other concomitant phenomena may result. When preterm and newborn infants are clinically compromised by a large PDA, surgical closure is so far the only alternative to pharmacological treatment.
   This study investigated whether interventional PDA closure is as effective and safe in preterm infants, full term infants and children weighing < 6 kg as in children with greater body weight.
   In a retrospective analysis the experiences of two centers which performed interventional PDA closure in preterm and full-term infants and in children with body weight of < 6 kg in the years 2004-2013 were studied.
   A total of 68 children weighing < 6 kg and with a hemodynamically relevant PDA were included in the analysis: 10 patients were preterm infants, 33 ex-preterm and 25 term. In all preterm and ex-preterm infants attempts to induce PDA closure by pharmacological means had been unsuccessful and in 62 out of 68 (91.2 %) of the infants interventional PDA closure was possible. The smallest patient weighed 2.2 kg, the median weight of the cohort was 3.7 kg (range 2.2-5.93 kg), preterm infants 2.4 kg (range 2.21-2.81 kg) and ex-preterm infants 3.3 kg (range 2.3-5.7 kg). The devices implanted most frequently (22 times) were the ADO II additional size (ADO II AS) and the AVP II (20 times). The most effective procedure was closure with an ADO II AS device, for which the initial closure rate was > 95 %. Device-associated complications were low at 3 % and there were no mortalities.
   Interventional PDA closure in children (preterm and full term infants) with a hemodynamically relevant PDA and associated clinical symptoms represents a safe and efficient therapy option after the conservative options have been exhausted. The procedure can be applied safely and successfully in children weighing less than 6 kg and as little as 2 kg.

AB  - Climate change, some claim, is this century's most important environmental challenge. Mortality estimates for the year 2000 from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate, however, that a dozen other risk factors contribute more to global mortality and global burden of disease. Moreover, the state-of-the-art British-sponsored fast track assessments (FTAs) of the global impacts of climate change show that through 2085-2100, climate change would contribute less to human health and environmental threats than other risk factors. Climate change is, therefore, unlikely to be the 21(st) century's most important environmental problem. Combining the FTA results with WHO's mortality estimates indicates that halting climate change would reduce cumulative mortality from hunger, malaria, and coastal flooding, by 4-10 percent in 2085 while the Kyoto Protocol would lower it by 0.4-1 percent. FTA results also show that reducing climate change will increase populations-at-risk from water stress and, possibly, threats to biodiversity. But adaptive measures focused specifically on reducing vulnerability to climate sensitive threats would reduce cumulative mortality by 50-75 percent at a fraction of the Kyoto Protocol's cost without adding to risks from water stress or to biodiversity. Such "focused adaptation" would, moreover, reduce major hurdles to the developing world's sustainable economic development, lack of which is the major reason for its vulnerability to climate change (and any other form of adversity). Thus, focused adaptation can combat climate change and advance global well-being, particularly of the world's most vulnerable populations, more effectively than aggressive GHG reductions. Alternatively, these benefits and more - reductions in poverty, and infant and maternal mortality by 50-75%; increased access to safe water and sanitation; and universal literacy - can be obtained by broadly advancing sustainable economic development through policies, institutions and measures (such as those that would meet the UN Millennium Development Goals) at a cost approximating that of the Kyoto Protocol. However, in order to deal with climate change beyond the 20852100 timeframe, the paper also recommends expanding research and development of mitigation options, reducing barriers to implementing such options, and active science and monitoring programs to provide early warning of any "dangerous" climate change impacts.

AB  - Normal birth is a eustress reaction, a beneficial hedonic stress with extremely high catecholamines that protects us from intrauterine hypoxia and assists in the rapid shift to extrauterine life. Occasionally the cellular O-2 requirement becomes critical and an O-2 deficit in blood (hypoxemia) may evolve to a tissue deficit (hypoxia) and finally a risk of organ damage (asphyxia). An increase in Hthorn concentration is reflected in a decrease in pH, which together with increased base deficit is a proxy for the level of fetal O-2 deficit. Base deficit (or its negative value, base excess) was introduced to reflect the metabolic component of a low pH and to distinguish from the respiratory cause of a low pH, which is a high CO2 concentration. Base deficit is a theoretical estimate and not a measured parameter, calculated by the blood gas analyzer from values of pH, the partial pressure of CO2, and hemoglobin. Different brands of analyzers use different calculation equations, and base deficit values can thus differ by multiples. This could influence the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis, which is commonly defined as a pH <7.00 combined with a base deficit >= 12.0 mmol/L in umbilical cord arterial blood. Base deficit can be calculated as base deficit in blood (or actual base deficit) or base deficit in extracellular fluid (or standard base deficit). The extracellular fluid compartment represents the blood volume diluted with the interstitial fluid. Base deficit in extracellular fluid is advocated for fetal blood because a high partial pressure of CO2 (hypercapnia) is common in newborns without concomitant hypoxia, and hypercapnia has a strong influence on the pH value, then termed respiratory acidosis. An increase in partial pressure of CO2 causes less increase in base deficit in extracellular fluid than in base deficit in blood, thus base deficit in extracellular fluid better represents the metabolic component of acidosis. The different types of base deficit for defining metabolic acidosis in cord blood have unfortunately not been noticed by many obstetrical experts and organizations. In addition to an increase in Hthorn concentration, the lactate production is accelerated during hypoxia and anaerobic metabolism. There is no global consensus on definitions of normal cord blood gases and lactate, and different cutoff values for abnormality are used. At a pH <7.20, 7% to 9% of newborns are deemed academic; at <7.10, 1% to 3%; and at <7.00, 0.26% to 1.3%. From numerous studies of different eras and sizes, it can firmly be concluded that in the cord artery, the statistically defined lower pH limit (mean -2 standard deviations) is 7.10. Given that the pH for optimal enzyme activity differs between different cell types and organs, it seems difficult to establish a general biologically critical pH limit. The blood gases and lactate in cord blood change with the progression of pregnancy toward a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidemia because of increased metabolism and CO2 production in the growing fetus. Gestational age-adjusted normal reference values have accordingly been published for pH and lactate, and they associate with Apgar score slightly better than stationary cutoffs, but they are not widely used in clinical practice. On the basis of good-quality data, it is reasonable to set a cord artery lactate cutoff (mean thorn2 standard deviations) at 10 mmol/L at 39 to 40 weeks' gestation.
   For base deficit, it is not possible to establish statistically defined reference values because base deficit is calculated with different equations, and there is no consensus on which to use. Arterial cord blood represents the fetus better than venous blood, and samples from both vessels are needed to validate the arterial origin. A venoarterial pH gradient of<0.02 is commonly used to differentiate arterial from venous samples. Reference values for pH in cord venous blood have been determined, but venous blood comes from the placenta after clearance of a surplus of arterial CO2, and base deficit in venous blood then overestimates the metabolic component of fetal acidosis. The ambition to increase neonatal hemoglobin and iron depots by delaying cord clamping after birth results in falsely acidic blood gas and lactate values if the blood sampling is also delayed. Within seconds after birth, sour metabolites accumulated in peripheral tissues and organs will flood into the central circulation and further to the cord arteries when the newborn starts to breathe, move, and cry. This influence of "hidden acidosis" can be avoided by needle puncture of unclamped cord vessels and blood collection immediately after birth. Because of a continuing anaerobic glycolysis in the collected blood, it should be analyzed within 5 minutes to not result in a falsely high lactate value. If the syringe is placed in ice slurry, the time limit is 20 minutes. For pH, it is reasonable to wait no longer than 15 minutes if not in ice. Routine analyses of cord blood gases enable perinatal audits to gain the wisdom of hindsight, to maintain quality assurance at a maternity unit over years by following the rate of neonatal acidosis, to compare results between hospitals on regional or national bases, and to obtain an objective outcome measure in clinical research. Given that the intrapartum cardiotocogram is an uncertain proxy for fetal hypoxia, and there is no strong correlation between pathologic cardiotocograms and fetal acidosis, a cord artery pH may help rather than hurt a staff person subjected to a malpractice suit based on undesirable cardiotocogram patterns. Contrary to common beliefs and assumptions, up to 90% of cases of cerebral palsy do not originate from intrapartum events. Future research will elucidate whether cell injury markers with point-of-care analysis will become valuable in improving the dating of perinatal injuries and differentiating hypoxic from nonhypoxic injuries.

AB  - The interment of infants in ceramic receptacles was a fairly widespread funerary practice in southern Africa during the Iron Age. Using the rich source of ethnographic data on child-death and mortuary practices among Southeast Bantu speakers, we explore the cultural significance and symbolic meaning of an infant pot burial uncovered on Melora Saddle, an early nineteenth-century African farmer settlement on the Waterberg Plateau, Limpopo Province. The skeletal remains belong to a perinatal individual, aged between 34 weeks gestation and newborn. The short-necked jar was interred in an upright position either inside, or close to, a house. Ethnographic data show that a conceptual link was made between a woman's reproductive capacity and the land's fertility, as well as between potting and procreation. A close symbolic link existed between pots, wombs, mothers and their houses. Child-birth and child-death were fraught with ritual danger that had to be averted to ensure the well-being of the family and the community. Any deviations from the natural order of things generated pollution (heat or dirt), which threatened a woman's fertility and a lineage's continuation. Such ritual impurity not only destabilised the social order, but also disturbed the natural order, as a result of which the rains, the ultimate sign of a community's well-being, might stay away. To counter the ritual danger, and thereby to restore a woman's fertility and avoid a drought, foetuses and infants were buried in jars, either in a cool, wet place in the bank of a river, or inside a house or in the shade under its eaves. As in the case of the Melora Saddle jar, the bases of such burial vessels were often deliberately perforated, evidently a symbolic act to ensure that a woman would become pregnant again. Ash, representing an extinguished fire, served as an important cooling agent in such burials, which would account for the location of several midden burials uncovered in Iron Age sites.

AB  - Two forms of roe deer, the European (Capreolus capreolus) and the Siberian (Capreolus pygargus), are widely recognised. Some authors consider these two forms as separate species, while others classify them as merely subspecies or races which are closely related. In this study, we compare the geographic distribution, morphological characteristics, karyotypes, biochemical variability, and potential for hybridisation of European and Siberian roe deer, addressing the question of their phylogenetic status. For most of historical times, the ranges of these two forms have been independent due to physical barriers such as glaciers or flooding. Overlap occurred for a time in the Middle Ages and again more recently, for the Last few decades, but even then, the potential hybrid zone was small and hybrids are not thought to have persisted. The Siberian roe deer is substantially Larger than its European counterpart in all body measurements, with only the very smallest Siberian individuals and the very largest European deer of approximately equivalent size. Furthermore, the two forms can be reliably distinguished on the basis of cranial shape, due to differential rates of growth of the skull, illustrating the hiatus in morphology between the two forms. All European roe have a karyotype of 2n = 70, while Siberian roe possess between 1 and 14 additional accessory B-chromosomes, increasing clinally from west to east. Changes in karyotype seem to occur at physical boundaries, suggesting the differences are due to partial or total absence of gene flow. On the basis of polymorphism of several enzymes as well as blood and muscle proteins, the genetic distance between the two forms is characteristic of fairly reliable species.
   A series of hybridisation experiments have illustrated that, although successful crosses can be achieved, they more often result in stillbirths or birth complications Leading to the death of both mother and kid, and reduced or complete infertility among F1 hybrid bucks. It is Likely therefore that hybridisation in the wild would be rare or absent, and that hybrids would not persist in the face of immigration of either pure form. We conclude that by all the criteria of classical systematics, the European and Siberian roe deer are separate, good, species, albeit phylogenetically closely related.

AB  - Hundreds of native heirloom varieties of potatoes of unknown origin are still utilized by subsistence farmers in the highlands of Peru, maintaining high levels of genetic diversity; yet these pockets of diversity paradoxically coincide with the highest levels of poverty and malnutrition. At the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000, 189 member States adopted a declaration that synthesized the priorities of the international agenda and reflected the commitments that had been painstakingly negotiated. The Millennium Declaration and the eight goals it identified have become a road map for tackling poverty, instability, HIV/AIDS, gender inequality, and violence in virtually all parts of the world. The International Potato Center (CIP)'s vision is to contribute to the fulfillment of the Millennium Development Goals, in particular those that relate to reducing poverty, hunger, child and maternal mortality, and sustainable development in rural and urban systems. New research with this valuable genetic resource targeting micronutrient levels, production, stress tolerance, and value adding for new markets is invigorating farming communities in the Andean center of origin and diversity of potato. Fe content (on a dry weight basis) is comparable to levels found in some cereals (rice, maize and wheat), but with better bio-availability due to lower phytate and higher ascorbic acid contents. A food intake study was carried out in six locations in Huancavelica to gain understanding of the role of the potato in the Andean diet, with an emphasis on women and children as the most vulnerable to malnutrition. Resulting information is being used to identify varieties with higher levels of Fe and Zn to improve micronutrient intake and simultaneously to assess the potential for enhancing Fe and Zn concentration through breeding and selection. An impressive range of 17-33% dry matter was found in a large number of native varieties, significantly higher than a control group of improved varieties, which contained 22-27% (Amoros et al., 2006). The outstanding organoleptic properties of many of the diploid and tetraploid native potatoes, as well as the relatively high contents identified for Fe and Zn (Burgos et al., 2007) and the antioxidant properties of those with high contents of anthocyanins (Culley et al., 2003.) are aimed at strengthening traditional Andean farming systems and benefiting potato farmers and consumers across the globe.

AB  - Background: Changes in climate and anthropogenic activities have made water salinization a significant threat worldwide, affecting biodiversity, crop productivity and contributing to water insecurity. The Horn of Africa, which includes eastern Ethiopia, northeast Kenya, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Somalia, has natural characteristics that favor high groundwater salinity. Excess salinity has been linked to infrastructure and health problems, including increased infant mortality. This region has suffered successive droughts that have limited the availability of safe drinking water resources, leading to a humanitarian crisis for which little spatially explicit information about groundwater salinity is available.
   Methods: Machine learning (random forest) is used to make spatial predictions of salinity levels at three electrical conductivity (EC) thresholds using data from 8646 boreholes and wells along with environmental predictor variables. Attention is paid to understanding the input data, balancing classes, performing many iterations, specifying cut-off values, employing spatial cross-validation, and identifying spatial uncertainties.
   Results: Estimates are made for this transboundary region of the population potentially exposed to hazardous salinity levels. The findings indicate that about 11.6 million people (similar to 7% of the total population), including 400,000 infants and half a million pregnant women, rely on groundwater for drinking and live in areas of high groundwater salinity (EC > 1500 mu S/cm). Somalia is the most affected and has the largest number of people potentially exposed. Around 50% of the Somali population (5 million people) may be exposed to unsafe salinity levels in their drinking water. In only five of Somalia's 18 regions are less than 50% of infants potentially exposed to unsafe salinity levels. The main drivers of high salinity include precipitation, groundwater recharge, evapo-ration, ocean proximity, and fractured rocks. The combined overall accuracy and area under the curve of multiple runs is similar to 82%.
   Conclusions: The modelled groundwater salinity maps for three different salinity thresholds in the Horn of Africa highlight the uneven spatial distribution of salinity in the studied countries and the large area affected, which is mainly arid flat lowlands. The results of this study provide the first detailed mapping of groundwater salinity in the region, providing essential information for water and health scientists along with decision-makers to identify and prioritize areas and populations in need of assistance.

AB  - Agricultural manures are the source of several pathogenic microorganisms in surface and groundwater that could cause diseases and adversely affect human health. Some strains of E. coli, an indicator microorganism, when transported over and/or through the soils reaching the water resources, cause urinary tract infections, diarrheal diseases, and contribute to infant mortality, fatal renal or neurological complications. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no information about the bacterial transport through natural/intact calcareous and gypsiferous soils. In this study, we selected four soil types to investigate the influence of lime and gypsum content on transport and filtration of E. coli released from cow manure during saturated and unsaturated flows. Intact soil columns from Hamadan and Isfahan provinces in Iran were transported to the laboratory. Cow manure was applied to the surface of each column at a rate of 10 Mg ha(-1) dry basis. Soil columns were leached up to four pore volumes (PVs) at 20 degrees C. E. coli influent (C-o) and effluent (C) concentrations were measured by the plate-count method and C-o/C values were drawn vs. PV as breakthrough curves (BTCs). Filtration coefficient (lambda(f)), relative adsorption index (S-R), and maximum depth of potential contamination (Z(max)) were calculated as indices of filtration and transport processes. Our results illustrated that contamination of water is possible where flooding irrigation systems occur in the low-lime soil due to low ionic strength and salinity, and greater structural stability. The BTCs showed that preferential pathways are greater in the low-lime soils than in the other studied soils. The presence of the natural lime and gypsum affected solution chemistry, macro and microporosity of the studied soils, which resulted in more bacterial filtration. The soils high in lime and gypsum also had maximum values for lambda(f) and S-R, respectively. Minimum Z(max) was observed in the high-lime soil and its mean was significantly lower than in the three other soils. The Z(max) was greater in saturated flow conditions than in unsaturated flow conditions. Overall, when a source of E. coli (e.g. cow manure) is applied on a low-lime or gypsum soil, subsurface water contamination would be expected while high-lime and gypsum soils could filter more bacteria. This study showed the effect of natural lime and gypsum on bacterial transportation through intact soils. It is suggested to use techniques such as scanning electron microscope (SEM) and image analysis to present pore-scale information for bacterial movement through calcareous and gypsiferous soils.

AB  - Background: Cattle are susceptible to chronic leptospirosis infection, that results in reduced milk production and reproductive disorders such as abortions, stillbirths, fetal malformation, and mummified fetuses, causing significant economic losses. Commercially available vaccines against leptospirosis offer limited protection to cattle because they contain only the most prevalent serovars worldwide, even though they are not prevalent in the specific region. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of specific antibodies against Leptospira serogroups, reproductive disorders and the risk factors in dairy herds from different mesoregions of Rio Grande do Sul State, Southern Brazil.
   Materials, Methods & Results: An epidemiological survey was conducted, and serum samples from the bovine population representative of three mesoregions (MR 1, MR2, and MR3) were studied; the samples were collected and tested for leptospirosis using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for 12 serogroups checking for the presence of agglutination. A total of 442 blood samples were collected from dairy cattle from November to December 2019 (MR1, 187; MR2, 88; and MR3, 167), including cows vaccinated with different commercial vaccines during the three months before sample collection (n = 295) and non-vaccinated against leptospirosis (n = 147). At the time of collection, an interview was conducted with the owners with questions about the health of the animals, management, habitat, feeding and reproduction. Chi-square tests univariate analysis with the SPSS (R) version 20.0 were performed to estimate the association of serogroup Djasiman seroreactivity with the occurrence of reproductive problems and related risk factors. The mean prevalence of antibodies against leptospires was 78.7% (MR1, 74.9 %; MR2, 84.1 %; and MR3, 80.2 %). Serogroup prevalence was different in each mesoregion evaluated and varied with vaccination status tested of the animals. The most prevalent serogroups in MR1 were Djasiman and Icterohaemorrhagiae. In MR2 and MR3, Djasiman was the most prevalent serogroup, regardless of vaccination status. Other prevalent serogroups in vaccinated animals were Icterohaemorrhagiae (MR1), Sejroe (MR2), Pomona, Sejroe, and Icterohaemorrhagiae (MR3). The other serovars tested had a prevalence of less or equal than 2%. The occurrence of reproductive problems with abortions and estrus repetition, was associated with reactivity to the serogroup Djasiman (P > 0.05). The results showed that the access of animals to flooded areas and the presence of rodents were significant risk factors, according to the literature.
   Discussion: The prevalence of antibodies against Leptospira in the studied areas was higher than expected, with a high prevalence of Djasiman serogroup. It is important to note that this serogroup is not present in current vaccine formulations. The presence of wetlands and rodents as risk factors in association with Djasiman is consistent with the scientific literature, since wild rodents are natural hosts, and swampy areas may allow Leptospira to survive for up to 180 days in the environment. Due to the presence and high prevalence found of the serogroup Djasiman in the experiment, new studies are being carried out to improve our knowledge about this serogroup and its possible inclusion in a commercial vaccine. Prophylaxis and control measures were recommended to rural producers in the analyzed properties.

AB  - Background: Congenital malformations are anomalies, structural or functional, that occur during the embryonic or fetal phase. There are several causes, one of which is the ingestion of toxic plants. Considering the importance of native toxic plants in the Central Backlands of Ceara state - Brazil, this paper reports cases of congenital malformations in sheep due to ingestion of Mimosa tenuiflora.
   Cases: Cases of abortion and malformations in sheep, were monitored in a rural property in the municipality of Piquet Cameiro with 20 ruminants (15 sheep and 5 cows) raised on a semi-intensive regime. The animals grazed during the day and were supplemented with corn, having unrestricted access to dam water. On its margins, there was a large amount of jurema preta (Mimosa tenuiflora), which the owner reported that the sheep consumed daily. The owner was unaware of the toxicity of M. tenuiflora but reported that cases of malformations had already occurred on his property some time ago. In an interval of approximately 12 days, 3 sheep miscarriage fetuses with multiple malformations. Malformed fetuses were referred for anatomopathological examination at the Animal Pathology Laboratory of the Veterinary Hospital of Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), Campus Patos, Paraiba, Brazil. The fetuses were necropsied and tissue samples of the nervous system and organs from the thoracic and abdominal cavities were collected, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, routinely processed for histopathology, included in paraffin, cut into 3 mu m sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). At necropsies were observed permanent contracture of the thoracic limb joints (arthrogryposis), particularly at the radio-carpal joints; incomplete medial fusion of the palatal bone, with communication between the oral and nasal cavities (palatoschisis); hypoplasia of the mandibular bone (micrognathia); unilateral hypoplasia of the incisive bone with discontinuity of the upper lip (cheiloschisis); unilateral hypoplasia of the eyeball (microphthahnia); lateral curvature of the cervical spine (scoliosis); and chest deformity characterized by ventral protrusion of the sternum and ribs (Pectus carinatum). At the histopathological evaluation of the tissues, no alterations were observed.
   Discussion: The diagnosis was based on the epidemiological, clinical, and anatomopathological findings. The semi-intensive management system applied on the property predisposed the sheep to ingestion of M. tenuiflora, which grows abundantly on the property and throughout the Central Backlands of Ceara, Brazil, with a high rate of geographical coverage. Despite that, most rural producers, especially subsistence farmers, are unaware of the toxic and teratogenic properties of the plant. In the northeastern, where there are long periods of drought coupled with forage shortages, poisoning by M. tenuiflora is a common cause of malformation and mortality in lambs. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt preventive measures in herds, such as raising awareness among producers about the toxic potential of some native plants and the practice of producing and supplying silage to animals, so that native toxic plants are not the only food source during the scarcity period.

AB  - This paper discusses two important issues: one is the Malaysian government decision to go nuclear to meet the future energy demands and the other is Lynas Rare-earth project to boost up the economy of the country. It should be noted that Malaysia is not new to such experiences as the Asian rare-earth project in the 1980s proved very costly causing rash of birth defects, painful miscarriages, and leukemia cases because of radioactive waste. This paper highlights the needs that future energy needs and economic targets can be overcome through other sources probably investing in renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydropower.
   Should Malaysia go nuclear to meet its future energy demands? Is Lynas Rare-earth Project environment friendly? These questions have been the focus of heated political debate in Malaysia for the last eight years. Mahathir Mohamad, who served as prime minister from 1981 to 2003, was firmly committed to a non-nuclear Malaysia. But since his departure, his successors have made some moves toward nuclear energy production. For example, in December 2010 Malaysia's energy minister Peter Chin announced plans to build two 1,000-megawatt nuclear power plants by 2022. A month later, Prime Minister Najib Razak announced the establishment of the Malaysian Nuclear Power Corporation, which will lead the planning process.
   The Fukushima nuclear accident, however, has raised new doubts about whether Malaysia is ready for nuclear power. Malaysian experts disagree over the need for nuclear power plants, and their potential impacts on public safety and the environment. There is little doubt that Malaysia must develop new energy sources to meet its future energy demands without relying on costly foreign imports. But we believe that these demands can be met with renewable energy instead.
   Hence, the Bukit Merah incident is still fresh in the minds of the public and recent nuclear incident in Japan has further fueled controversy on the issue. The residents were particularly concerned over the effects of the emission from the plant and its radioactive waste on the health and safety of their families.
   In addition, the construction of Lynas Rare-earth project is also an issue of concern in Malaysia. Rare-earth can be defined as a group of metal elements comprises 15 types of lanthanides and also Scandium and Yattrium. In fact, all these 17 elements are profuse in the environment. Nevertheless, these elements cannot easily be browbeaten as they likely to be discrete and not rigorous at a meticulous area. These elements are highly obsessive for manufacturing high tech goods like electric car, smart-phones and fiber optic cables. So far, China has been the monopoly of rare-earth that produces more than 90 % of the rare earth supplies throughout the world. Recently, Malaysian government has given approval to an Australian listed Lynas Corp Ltd to install plants in Malaysia to transport processed raw material in Pahang. Lynas Corp Ltd owns a huge deposit of such elements at Mount Weld Australia in order to generate a steadfast and incorporated resource of Rare Earths supply to patrons in the global Rare Earths industry. The company's new plan is to process raw material in Mount Weld and transport it to Advanced Materials Plant in Malaysia. The capital cost for both these plants, concentration plant in Australia and advanced material plant in Malaysia is estimated at A$339.19 million.
   An important question that pinches our minds is that why Malaysia was chosen for this purpose? According to Lynas, it initially planned to install the plant solely in Australia but several factors did not favor this plan, for example, shortage of water, location that could be suitable for all infrastructure needs, short supply of engineering and construction skills and additionally industrial and port capacity. The plan was also under consideration in China that produces more than 90 % of the rare earth supplies throughout the world. But because of the Chinese government decision to impose export limits on products and also applied import and export taxes up to 25% on final products specially on rare earth. Alternatively, Lynas has picked Malaysia as the favorite location mainly because of its immediacy to market, access to high quality chemicals, utilities and engineering skills and also its transparent regulatory framework.
   The Lynas Rare Earth project is comprised of two plants: Concentration plant at Mount Weld and an advanced material plant in Malaysia. The phase 1 is expected to produce 11000t REO annually and the phase 2 is likely to increase this capacity up to 22,000t REO by the year 2013. Both phases aim at the construction of the Concentration plant at Mount Weld and also an advanced material plant to process the concentrate through to final Rare Earths oxides in the Gebeng Industrial Estate, Pahang, Malaysia. Lynas has received all required approvals to construct both plants. The estimated capital cost to complete Phase 1 of both the Concentration Plant in Western Australia and the Advanced Materials Plant in Malaysia is A$339.19 million and as a whole it is estimated at $407.32 million. Lynas says that it has got approval for the construction of both plants.
   The Malaysian interest in the project remains in two main areas: first, it will enable generate revenues amounting up to one per cent of the Malaysian GDP and secondly, it will create hundreds of jobs for the people in connection with the plant.

TI  - Status of Desertification in the Mediterranean Region

AB  - Assessment of the status of Mediterranean desertification requires a robust and agreed upon definition of desertification, which is still lacking, partly due to the widespread use of "desertification" either interchangeably or in conjunction with "land degradation". By definition desertification is a subset of land degradation confined to drylands, thus adding "land degradation" to "desertification" implies relevance of the UNCCD to land degradation in both drylands and non-drylands, globally and in the Mediterranean. Another interpretation for pairing "desertification" and "land degradation" is that desertification is not a globally spatial but a dryland temporal subset of land degradation; namely "desertification" represents culmination of the process of land degradation in the drylands. The UNCCD usage of "desertification" (to be combated) in conjunction with drought (to be mitigated) and climatic variations (a desertification driver) also confounds understanding and assessment of desertification and its status. Qualifying desertification its a persistent reduction of biological productivity in the drylands may resolve difficulties in addressing desertification, though no agreement exists as to what degree of degradation and its reversibility properties would qualify as desertification.
   Desertification is habitually believed to be driven by human impact proportional to Population size and growth rate, which are higher than the global average and relative to all other ecosystems, respectively. Global scale data demonstrating that desertification is highest at the intermediate section of the aridity gradient suggest that desertification is driven by an interaction of ecosystem sensitivity (expressed by natural biological productivity) and the pressure exerted on land resources (expressed by population density). Yet, though GDP and infant mortality rates are lower and higher in drylands, relatively to other ecosystems and to global averages, respectively, it is not known if the drylands' low human well-being is driven by desertification, or by the inherently low productivity of drylands impacted by growing populations, or both. Thus desertification constitutes a paradigm, one of a downward spiral of degradation leading to human misery, through self-reinforcing positive feedback loops. This paradigm is reinforced by an environmental security narrative, in which migrations and conflicts driven by the desertification-associated demand and supply-induced environmental scarcities, reduce overall environmental security in the drylands. A "counter paradigm" based on some evidence suggests that drylands' adversities trigger "induced innovations" in rural communities that lead to development tracks which circumvent desertification. Yet, if dryland population continues to increase the "induced ingenuity" will eventually be exhausted, unless dryland livelihoods independent of land productivity are gradually adopted.
   Mediterranean climates, of wet winters but dry summers, prevail in five seaboard semiarid and dry-subhumid regions on the globe, one of which is the Mediterranean Basin, with a long history of intensive use by man resulting in biological adaptations providing high ecosystem resilience to human impact. The southern, African lands of the Mediterranean Basin are drier than the northern, European lands, the latter being mainly semiarid drylands, with high desertification extent, yet more people are affected by desertification in the southern than in the northern sections of the Basin. All over the Mediterranean Basin the most extensively used land is also the most intensively used and becoming most degraded, irrespective of type of use. Thus in the northern Mediterranean desertification is driven by irrigation developments, themselves driven by markets and regional agricultural policies, whereas in the Southern Mediterranean desertification is driven by encroachment of cultivation on rangelands, which are driven by population growth and national policies. Yet, the Mediterranean ecosystems are fairly resilient to mounting external pressures, due to a balance in the interaction of soil state with soil vegetation cover, up to a point in which a threshold is crossed.
   A way to avoid desertification in grazed Mediterranean shrublands is to encourage the historical prevalence of a spatio-temporal mosaic of distinct patches of annual and perennial vegetation through controlling grazing and fire at moderate levels, and moving these controls adaptively and dynamically between patches. Yet, when degradation did take over, rehabilitation through afforestation have taken place on a large scale in the Mediterranean Basin. This afforestation, mainly with Aleppo Pine, reduced soil erosion and flooding but compromised water resources and poorly performed in restoring the indigenous vegetation cover, but seemed to be more successful and water-efficient in drier areas, where the objective was soil conservation rather than the vegetation restoration.
   Global climate change is projected to exert an additional pressure on the Mediterranean drylands, through an overall decrease in water resources, such that even a relatively small climatic change would suffice to initiate a spatio-temporal transformation of the Mediterranean semiarid to arid drylands, and also an overall transformation of non-drylands into drylands, in both their climate and their biological productivity. Given the projected combined impacts of global climate change, dryland population growth and the pressure on drylands brought about by global decline in good cultivable land, it may be effective to address Mediterranean desertification as an environmental security issue, which encompasses risking food security, health security, livelihood security, national and transboundary security. However, the direct links between desertification and migration within the Mediterranean Basin have not yet been demonstrated.
   Even though means to promote land productivity improve, an eventual widespread desertification leading to reduced human well-being, land desertion and migration can emerge in the Mediterranean Basin. A way out is to explore means of diversifying dryland livelihoods, such that the pressure on land resources is reduced yet dryland people opt to stay on their land. Paradoxically, with all its drawbacks, global climate change provides opportunities to people of the Mediterranean drylands, encouraging them to diversify their livelihoods, e.g. afforestation in the non-desert Mediterranean drylands for carbon trading, and solar energy development in the desert drylands for exporting electricity. These and other livelihoods of advantage in drylands yet not depending on dryland land resources can be mixed with improvements of traditional dryland livelihoods. Thus the flows between the southern and northern Mediterranean may dramatically transform - rather than development aid cash, payments for purchases of clean energy would flow from the North to the South, and the South-North flow of migrants would be replaced by North-South flow of tourists. These changes would promote the sustainability of dryland livelihoods especially in the South, and would bring abut environmental security and Subsequent political stability throughout the Mediterranean Basin.

AB  - This study was conducted to predict the genetic (co)variance components of growth curve parameters of Moghani sheep breed using the following information: birth weight (N = 7278), 3-mo-old weight (N = 5881), 6-mo-old weight (N = 5013), 9-mo-old weigh (N = 2819], and 12-mo-old weight (N = 2883). The growth parameters (A: maturity weight, B: growth rate, and K: maturity rate) were calculated using Gompertz, Logistic, Brody, and Von Bertalanffy nonlinear models via NLIN procedure of SAS software. The aforementioned models were compared using Akaike information criterion, root mean square error, adjusted co-efficient of determination. Also, both Bayesian (using MTGSAM) and RMEL (using WOMBAT) paradigms were adapted to predict the genetic (co)variance components of growth parameters (A, B, K) due to the best fitted growth models. It was turned out that Von Bertalanffy best fitted to the data in this study. The year of birth and lamb gender had a significant effect on maturity rate (P < 0.01). Also it turned out that within the growth parameter, with increasing (co)variance matrix complexity, the Bayesian paradigm fitted well to the data than the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) one. However, for simple animal model and across all growth parameters, REML outperformed Bayesian. In this way, the h(a)(2) predicted (0.15 & PLUSMN; 0.05), (0.11 & PLUSMN;.05), and (0.04 & PLUSMN; 0.03) for A, B, and K parameters, respectively. Practically, in terms of breeding plan, we could see that genetic improvement of growth parameters in this study is not a tractable strategy to follow up and improvement of the management and environment should be thoroughly considered. In terms of paradigm comparison, REML's bias correction bears up an advantageous approach as far as we are concerned with small sample size. To this end, REML predictions are fairly accurate but the mode of posterior distributions could be overestimated. Finally, the differences between REML and Bayesian estimates were found for all parameter data in this study. We conclude that simulation studies are necessary in order to trade off these parading in the complex random effects scenarios of genetic individual model.
   Lay Summary The Iran plateau is known to be the origin of many sheep species nowadays. In Iran, different production systems are operated ranging from intensive to lower-input/extensive ones. However, the majority of these sheep breeds are extensively managed, where lambs are born outside and with little intervention and generally they experience frequent drought and shortage of nutritional value of forages. Meanwhile, the weight of lambs as a whole play a major decision role in rearing or culling them. However, investigations involving the possible genetic improvement of lamb weights over different periods of time have found low genetic variations. This study serves to be comprehensive in addressing this issue in Moghani sheep breed. Fitting many different genetics models over both restricted maximum likelihood and Bayesian paradigms indicated that heritability of weight spanned 0.03 to 0.23. The low genetic variation would lead to recommendations that the improvement of Moghani lamb weights should rather be based upon modification of the environment to create conditions suitable for weight of lambs. This reflects that breeders of Moghani sheep breed have less options to tackle Iran harsh conditions using Moghani sheep genetic potentials.
   One of the main challenges in estimation of genetic variance components, a cornerstone of breeding schemes, is choosing the right paradigm for estimation of aforementioned components. In this study, we showed that by increasing the number and complexity of variance components, Bayesian paradigm overtakes restricted maximum likelihood in terms of explaining much better the data.

AB  - When the sick, injured, or dying arrive in a hospital - often along with family members - they find themselves on an alien landscape. Elderly people enter unfamiliar territory as they move from home or hospital into a long-term care setting, which may be the first in a series of placements for their final years. African Americans have been subjected for decades to oppressive urban planning policies, including 'serial displacement', which have systematically uprooted and dispersed them, their homes, and their places of business and worship. Around the world currently, 65 million people are displaced, most trying to escape uninhabitable environs involving war, persecution, drought, and famine. Some of these migrants and asylum-seekers reside in and around refugee camps but many are in urban enclaves or isolated outside them in desperately inhospitable conditions. Some are trying to integrate and make homes in new countries. Still more people are coming in perilous flight from the unfurling effects of climate change. 'We are place-lings,' according to Ed Casey, 'never without emplaced experiences'. Lorraine Code, explaining our social and geographical embeddedness and interdependence, describes us as 'ecological subjects'. By recognizing place, we can deepen our appreciation for the ways in which we are radically relational, that is, interdependent with people, non-human others, and particular locations. This robust and realistic conception of our relational nature and its implications for health and ethics deserves more attention. Elsewhere I have argued for 'ethical place-making' as morally obligatory for supporting the capability to be healthy, or health justice, for ecological subjects. Drawing on this conception of persons as creatures situated in specific social relations, geographic locations, and atmospheric and material environments, here I emphasize the importance of place and argue for an ideal and practice of 'ethical place-making' as an essential and, indeed, ethically required way of demonstrating and forging future solidarity and advancing justice, particularly health justice. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I explain what I mean by place and examine the relationships, revealed by contemporary research in social epidemiology, between place and health. In Section 3, I build on the conception of persons as ecological subjects to ground what Carol Gould has called 'solidaristic recognition', which, as I will interpret it, requires us to reckon with the significance of place in our relational nature. I then link solidaristic recognition to the ideal and practice of ethical place-making and, in turn, the capability to be healthy, that is, health justice. I argue that place-based interventions should be principal and prioritized ways of showing solidarity and promoting justice - especially health justice - for ecological subjects, above all those who are displaced and/or insecurely placed. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, ethical place-making has the potential to catalyze and nurture them and, over time, to advance justice.
   A full discussion of the complex and contested relationship between solidarity and global justice is beyond the scope of what I can expound on here; I follow - and present concrete manifestations of - the views of Iris Marion Young and Carol Gould in seeing solidarity as having, as Gould puts it, a crucial 'role not only in motivating people's commitment to the realization of global justice but [also] contribut[ing] to its construction or constitution.' In Section 4, I present examples of ethical place-making inspired by solidaristic recognition in a range of domains significant for bioethics - clinical and long-term care and urban planning in the United States and Netherlands, and refugee care and resettlement in Lebanon and Germany. In the cases presented, I describe how the particular elements of ethical place-making, emerging from solidaristic recognition, are realized, and so support the conditions for the capability to healthy, or health justice. Following this discussion, I move on to the conclusion. Place 'is no fixed thing'. The accounts of geographers, philosophers, and some architects emphasize our embodied experience in or around place(s), place's significance for the development of our subjectivity and identity, and, finally, the complex social processes that help to create, maintain, and transform places (and, in turn, bodies and subjectivities). The understanding I follow here defines 'place' in terms of the material environment, and how we, as embodied beings, move in, absorb, shape and are shaped by it, and how we, as social agents, interact with and within it, gather and attach particular meanings, and forge relationships and identities. A growing body of research in social epidemiology using realist methods explains in increasingly rich, if grim, detail the ways in which social conditions and features of the external environment, including place-related factors, affect health and longevity, and contribute to preventable health inequities. We are talking about components of the built environment, like land use, housing design, materials and quality, street layout and transportation, exposure to toxins, and violence, access to food and activity options; and urban design or decline. Air and water quality, and access to green space are other place-related factors. We should also include climate and the potential in specific locations for climate-related disasters in our scope of concern. So-called 'determinants' such as these operate independently and interactively at various levels and in different contexts to generate harms to health and health inequities. On terrain more typical for bioethics, clinical and other care settings, as currently configured, are notoriously disorienting, anxiety-inducing, and in some ways dangerous for physical, psychological, and existential health. Researchers have detailed a range of effects of institutional design, including the effects of noise and light on recovery times, and the ways architecture can shape interactions and experiences. Long-term care settings are infamous for poor conditions. A lack of light, private space, and access to the outdoors, for example, and isolation from broader social surroundings, adversely affect the health of elderly people. People fleeing war, persecution, and famine endure desperate conditions that threaten health. Many reside in camps (in the form of transit camps and official refugee camps, detention centers, etc.
   ) while others dwell in slums or other settlements - primarily in urban areas - segregated from the majority population. These people suffer from a range of complex physical and mental health conditions. Before or during transit and in camps and other settings, they face food insecurity, risk of communicable disease, fear, violence, loss, and other experiences. If there is access to health services it is often restricted to acute medical care, and not equipped to adequately address chronic or mental health conditions or the social determinants of health needs. Migrants and asylum-seeking people thus lack crucial capabilities to be healthy. It is not that a relationship between place and health is a modern epiphany. Hippocrates' Airs, waters, and places, the epidemiological work of Louis-Rene Villerme and Rudolph Virchow in the 19th century, and the histories of public health and urban planning, all recognized the importance of environmental conditions. The asylums for the mentally ill in the late 19th century reveal an attention, if not yet evidence-based, for place in care and healing. Inspired by the Moral Treatment movement, New Enlightenment intellectuals, and health advocates like Dorthea Dix, Thomas Kirkbride established professional guidelines on institutional layout and room design for patients. Realist methods in social epidemiology, more recently, have deepened our appreciation and understanding of the processes at work on our corporeal nature, and our entanglement with the world around us. We are situated socially, materially, and geographically, and vulnerable as creatures who need care and who also need to 'fit' with the places in which we dwell and through which we navigate. We are, in short, ecological subjects, beings for whom social interdependence and geographic locatedness are vital. As I will argue below, health justice, or the capability to be healthy, therefore demands thoughtful attention to place and the conditions that create and sustain places. In the next section, I explain the relationship between recognizing people as ecological subjects and the ideal and practice of solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it, refers to reaching out through engaging our moral imaginations across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to recognize and assist others who are vulnerable, in some cases, acutely, and, over time, advance justice. As a practice, solidarity involves two core 'enacted commitments'. The first commitment is to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need, or what I will describe below as solidaristic recognition. The second commitment is to responsive action. This hybrid definition draws upon the inspirational work of Iris Marion Young, Carol Gould, Fuyuki Kurasawa, and Prainsack and Buyx, all of whom build upon a long and rich history of interpretations of solidarity. Recognizing the suffering of the displaced and others who are 'implaced' in conditions unable to sustain them follows from the most minimal appreciation of people as ecological subjects, relational creatures who are densely enmeshed in social relations as well as spatial locations. While my analysis differs substantially, to describe this here I use Carol Gould's term, 'solidaristic recognition'. Gould distinguishes between what she calls 'rigorous recognition' and 'generous recognition'.
   Rigorous recognition appreciates the equality of all people through an essentially cognitive process involving an acknowledgment of our fellow humanity. The generous genre, which she recasts as 'solidaristic recognition', involves empathy, or an affective link with others, and focuses on our 'mutual interdependence and common needs'. Solidaristic recognition conceives of others as 'equal in their difference', that is, their distinctive social group membership and individual particularity. On my own interpretation, solidaristic recognition has two varieties, neither of which relies on empathy: basic and relational, responsible recognition. If we conceive of people in ecological terms, basic recognition (similar to Gould's 'rigorous recognition') might be expanded beyond its appreciation of everyone's equal moral worth to take account of the significance of place for the equitable flourishing of all ecological subjects. This most basic form of recognition acknowledges that we are equal in part because we all share a need to be 'in place' in settings that can sustain us and support our capacities. A second, more ethically responsible, form of recognition I will call relational solidaristic recognition emerges from reckoning more thoroughly with our radically relational nature as ecological subjects. This reckoning demands that we conceive of ourselves and others as embedded but also that we understand that we are constitutive of one another and our environs. Geographers have described this in terms of the intersubjectivity of identity and place. In her philosophical account of ecological subjectivity, Lorraine Code underscores the idea that we are 'made by and making [our] relations in [asymmetrical] reciprocity with other subjects and with horizontal ellipsis multiple, diverse locations'. Seeing not just identities, but also, critically, place in relational terms, highlights 'the variety of interactions between people who are located differently that go into making places'. As Iris Young puts it, we 'dwell together' in 'complex, causal' relations of interdependence and in specific atmospheric and material conditions on earth in geographic regions and neighborhoods, in homes, and institutions of care and employment. We ecological subjects, then, contribute to the construction of place - often unintentionally - through actions and interactions within a larger context of social structures and processes. These structures and processes serve to enable some people in the realization of their capacities, yet constrain others, creating and/or sustaining structural injustice. This is evidenced, for example, in urban planning policies that spawn residential segregation or global economic and trade policies that compel health care workers to migrate and deepen health inequities in source countries. While basic solidaristic recognition can allow for or has the potential to generate ethical place-making, relational recognition understands the ways that our own subjectivities, identities, and places of dwelling as ecological subjects are formed in relation to other identities in other places and, crucially, that this generates responsibilities for justice. It is in this sense that relational solidaristic recognition is a more responsible form: it appreciates better-situated ecological subjects' contributions to the injustice suffered by the displaced or precariously placed, and aspires to respond and work toward promoting justice.
   Responsiveness , an important epistemic and, in turn, ethical capacity, is a crucial element for enactments of solidarity in the view I want to develop. Both Joan Tronto and Elise Springer assign 'responsiveness' a prominent place in their work. Springer situates 'responsiveness' within virtue ethics. On her view, it involves a kind of adaptability, particularly in unfamiliar moral terrain, or in the face of concerns that 'resist clear representation'. Springer posits responsiveness as also involving a commitment to 'extend a temporally continuous thread of attention' or giving one's moral attention over time, not episodically or reactively. Tronto identifies responsiveness as one of four ethical elements of care, casting it as a moral capacity that involves vigilance 'to the possibilities for abuse that arise with vulnerability'. I would add another element as integral to responsiveness, drawn specifically from ecological epistemology: an ability to show finely tuned sensitivity to context, that is, the particularity of people and circumstance, and give attention and action that is fitting. Solidarity, enacted, should emerge from a disposition committed to responsiveness understood in terms of these capacities, if it is to meet the mark. In the next section I turn to responsive action that arises from solidaristic recognition, in particular, efforts at place-making for the displaced. Innovation, inspired by ecological thinking and increasingly evidence-based, is underway. 'Place-making' is a set of intentional practices spanning different disciplines that targets neighborhoods, parks and paths, features of landscape, housing developments, streetscapes, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. With and without attention to health, it is either referenced explicitly or somehow central to key international documents and declarations including the Sustainable Development Goals and UN Habitat's New Urban Agenda. It is on the agendas of the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), even the World Bank, some think tanks and foundations, and a major US corporation. Public health leaders point to place-based interventions as 'the new frontier'. In other work I have interpreted ethical place-making, a notion that first surfaced in the geography literature, as a core component of an enabling, capabilities-oriented conception of justice. Grounded in ecological thinking and an ecological conception of persons, ethical place-making understands all people as embedded socially and spatially, and often enmeshed in relationships of structural injustice that threaten health. Key elements of ethical place-making include: nurturing relations of care and interdependence; protecting bodily integrity; supporting autonomy, not interpreted in terms of individual self-reliance, but in the relational sense that sees us as originating, persisting, and flourishing within relations of care and interdependence, given ongoing opportunities for self-directed thought and action; promoting stability and a sense of rootedness and, at the same time, supporting generative movement; and finally, where necessary, responding to inequities. Below I offer selected examples of place-making drawn from a range of domains pertinent to bioethics.
   After describing them, I explain why they count as instances of ethical place-making inspired by (and potentially generating more) solidaristic recognition and how they stand to promote - especially health - justice and in some cases address health inequities. I start at the level of community and public health with an urban planning example, and from there, turn to a clinical and then a long-term care setting. These three case studies come from the global north. The final examples explore (mostly health-centered) place-making efforts in refugee reception and resettlement, sketching innovations in Germany and also Lebanon, a country that borders the war in Syria and ranks fourth worldwide as a host to refugees. Further research will yield additional instances of solidarity and place-making, particularly for health, in other parts of the world.
   In [a] system of the city as weaving, [creating] crosswise threads enables solidarity, and fundamental to solidarity is the free system of movement horizontal ellipsis 'Intentional shrinkage', 'sorting', and 'serial displacement' are terms given to the urban land use and 'development' policies that systematically shredded the social and material fabric in and around African American neighborhoods in New York City. Public health researchers have linked these policies and the consequent displacement of families, businesses, churches and more, to the AIDS epidemic, addiction, asthma, post-traumatic stress, and obesity. Working together, citizens, planners, and researchers responded with the Giraffe Path (GP), a 6-mile trail from Central Park to the Cloisters. The walking and biking path is a project emerging explicitly from the kind of solidarity described above: the recognition of the city and its people as ecologically embedded, with enduring health inequities as a result of displacements, and responsive action in the form of (re)creating place with and for ecological subjects. The GP is based on a conception of the city and its neighborhoods and residents as interdependent - and is designed to restore connections between formerly fractured communities around and across the Harlem River and, at the same time, to support outdoor physical activity. The closure of the bridge, that had long linked neighbors, as a 'crime-prevention' measure for gentrifying neighborhoods, severed (in a pattern repeated in cities everywhere) relationships between people according to categories of class and race. By (re)connecting places and people and mending - as its designers say, 'weaving', 're-stitching' - the GP helps restore these and cultivate new relations. At the same time, as part of the City Life Is Moving Bodies (CLIMB) Project, the GP's creation of flow and unimpeded movement is being celebrated as 'a victory for the city's entire circulatory system'. The attention paid to (solidaristic recognition of) the importance of place for health and most significantly, health inequities, in this instance of ethical place-making is an exception and not the norm. Urban renewal policies and planning tend to prioritize physical, economic, and social issues, yet few focus explicitly on health or show concern for health equity. Another essential dimension for future solidarity is the potential for political engagement generated by the GP.
   As Iris Young argues (and the inset quote implies), segregation obscures from the affluent an appreciation of their privilege, and, by limiting interaction, constrains political communication. This erodes the potential for solidarity and perpetuates social injustice. The GP designers aspire to promote solidaristic recognition through facilitating new interactions, forging new relations, and evolving as ecological subjects.
   We must pay attention to the lived spatial significance of patients' experience of health and illness if we are going to treat them fully and well. Doing so is one step of paying attention to a person horizontal ellipsis The terrain and overall ambience of the clinical setting is famously hostile to non-medical people, notably the ones it exists to serve. Place-centered innovation in hospitals and other centers of care is a growing niche, recognizing the harms done to ecological subjects - here patients and their families - in the 'care' of institutions built as medical assembly lines organized around time until discharge or demise. One neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, U.K., recognizes the importance of place for the health and well-being of vulnerable ecological subjects and puts into practice a concept known as 'secure base', which wraps around patients and families 'like a hug'. The unit's design also demonstrates solidarity with them in recognizing the effects of typical clinical settings and, in contrast, boasts lots of natural light, greatly reduced noise, private nooks, and a horseshoe-shape design that reflects the progression a newborn will take from intensive care to a neonatal room. In this case of ethical place-making, innovators aim to create a habitat that nurtures overlapping relations of care wherein babies sleep longer, and parents are perhaps a little less distressed, and more able to participate in care and interact with clinical care providers. As noted above, the structure of this temporary dwelling enables families to better understand, through their embodied experience, the clinical pathway the infants will follow until discharge, which in turn likely gives a boost to their sense of agency and empowerment and helps to level the playing field with clinicians. Designed by a long-term care nurse in response to her observations and experience of existing institutions, Hogeway Village accommodates elderly people with dementia in a setting meant to resemble a real European neighborhood. It has a market, cafe, salon, theater, sidewalks, and ample green space. Different models, tailored to appeal to specific social and cultural groups, are available. Staff engage with residents without clinical garb and simultaneously provide skilled care. Family members are integrally involved in care plans. Hogeway is built to protect yet not restrict, allowing residents a wide range of movement and access to the outdoors. The availability of palliative care ensures that residents do not have to relocate at the end of life, which allows for continuity of care and relationships. Another benefit is that family members need not navigate new terrains, or settings, of care or transportation as elders' needs evolve. Emerging research on long-term care settings designed more like homes and communities suggests that residents are more socially engaged and active, and experience better overall 'well-being'.
   Preliminary evidence also suggests that integrating families in care can improve relations with care workers, as well as resident care and health.
   European cities and regions have demonstrated their horizontal ellipsis willingness to express solidarity with horizontal ellipsis the world's refugees via participation in resettlement. Solidarity is at the moral center of humanitarian action, and place-making by other names has long been integral to humanitarian operations. From an emphasis on emergency and temporary assistance, humanitarians have expanded the scope and practice of 'solidarity' given the nature of current conflicts and the creation of dependencies that may lead to more sustained commitments. Their work now increasingly overlaps with development efforts to bolster host countries' capacities to receive, resettle, and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long term. Solidarity, indeed, is the basis of commitments to refugee resettlement in international humanitarian law. In 2004, the Mexico Plan of Action to Strengthen International Protection of Refugees in Latin America (MPA), which encompassed regional responsibility sharing, the expansion of resettlement space, reception capacity, and long-term integration, highlighted solidarity as a guiding principle for support of refugees from Columbia and their host countries. Northern Europe has been the preferred destination for refugees from Syria and other places where war has driven people from their homes. Germany, especially its cities, hosts more recent asylum-seekers than any other EU nation. Urban areas have absorbed two-thirds of the world's refugees and now face the work of integration. The region offers myriad examples of efforts in ethical place-making spawned by solidaristic recognition. In both Hamburg and Berlin, organizing around place has been a key strategy in welcoming and helping to integrate new arrivals. In Berlin, city planners have employed a strategy of creating container villages to help refugees feel secure and foster a sense of embeddedness-in-community. While formalized, state-administered efforts have unfolded, citizen volunteers have designed innovative responses to link refugees with needed services, helping to integrate them and provide a sense of place. The coordinated state and civil society effort, in particular, is an inspiring example of politically and socially constructed solidarity, supported and advanced by what Christine Straehle calls a 'cosmopolitan avant-garde' of citizens. Hamburg is also innovative in linking services across sectors like food, shelter, education, work skills, and legal advice, appreciating the importance of integrating services for those who have endured profound dispersion and fragmentation. The city addressed housing needs by redesigning existing buildings and engaged local communities in deciding on locations in order to help ensure a welcoming, safe environment and avoid the possibility of local neighborhood resistance. The countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey that serve as the principal hosts to refugees fleeing Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, are organizing around so-called 'resilience' strategies, which aim at bolstering host countries' capacities to accept and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long-term. This management philosophy deserves more sustained discussion. I highlight here another civil society initiative involving ethical place-making.
   In Lebanon during the war (1975-1990) public spaces were among the most dangerous places. Now they serve as temporary shelter areas for migrants and refugees displaced from neighboring conflict who face fear, discrimination, and violence in their new environs. In this context, one architect saw an opportunity: 'I thought by promoting place-making in Lebanon we can join the efforts of local [civil society] actors, since horizontal ellipsis place-making is based on networking and bringing people together.' With his guidance, youth in Beirut participated in identifying and recreating public spaces with the aims of reducing violence, promoting inclusion, interaction, and community-building. Along with place-making for the sake of social integration, place-based interventions in healthcare services are surfacing in response to contemporary migration patterns. Adapting to the mobility of many displaced people who are, not accessing services in camps, for instance, humanitarian and local actors have reorganized healthcare delivery. The Blue Dot Hubs developed by UNHCR and partners to provide care and services to people en route are a specific example of a response - a place-making intervention to 'changing therapeutic geographies' in modern crises. In the context of resettlement, interventions focused on the creation of 'therapeutic landscapes' aim specifically at displaced children as they resettle in new countries. Through recultivating cultural traditions, building social networks, and creating safe places, young people can create new homes. These examples depict different modes of displacement and distinct populations situated in specific kinds of settings and in particular - yet in all cases asymmetrical - relations of power. In each case, responsive action, keenly sensitive to context, emerges from solidaristic recognition, either basic or relational. In some cases it aims explicitly at justice. We can see specific elements of solidarity-sparked ethical place-making across cases. Support for relations of care is at the heart of the efforts made in the Bath NICU and Hogeway Village designs, and also in the GP and initiatives for refugees. Attention to the need for rootedness and movement is manifested in these civil society efforts to welcome and create material, social, economic, and political space for refugees; it is also an organizing principle for the GP, Hogeway, and Bath's NICU. Transformative autonomy is evident in the GP, the therapeutic landscape projects, Hogeway, and the NICU. Attention to inequities, especially health inequities, motivates the GP and Blue Dot Hubs. In all, the creators - architects, designers, planners, carers, and citizens - recognize the 'users', let us say 'dwellers', as ecological subjects and respond with concerned attention to their distinctive needs, in real time and over time with the aim of supporting their capabilities, chiefly to be healthy, and in some cases to remedy injustice. I have argued that recognizing all people as ecological subjects enables us, indeed compels us, to forge relations of solidarity and promote justice through ethical place-making with those who are vulnerable through their insecure relationship to place.
   On the moral landscape(s) of bioethics, an ethic of place-making expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity along with advancing health, social, and global justice with patients and families, elderly people transitioning to long-term care, urban populations confronting health inequities, asylum-seekers dwelling in precarious conditions, and perhaps others.

INTRODUCTION PLACE AND HEALTH: ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTS ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTIVITY AND SOLIDARITY Solidaristic recognition Responsiveness SOLIDARITY (AND HEALTH JUSTICE) ENACTED: ETHICAL PLACE-MAKING Community and public health Care settings Refugee assistance and integration The elements of ethical place-making CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes Drawing on a conception of people as 'ecological subjects', creatures situated in specific social relations, locations, and material environments, I want to emphasize the importance of place and place-making for basing, demonstrating, and forging future solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it here, involves reaching out through moral imagination and responsive action across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to assist other people who are vulnerable, and to advance justice. Contained in the practice of solidarity are two core 'enacted commitments', first, to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need and, second, to responsive action.
   Recognizing the suffering of displacement and responding through place-making should follow from even the most simplistic understanding of people as 'implaced'. Recognition, furthermore, that places are created and sustained, transformed, or neglected in ways that foster or perpetuate inequities, including health inequities, generates responsibilities concerning place-making. Place-based interventions, on either count, should be principal and, indeed, prioritized ways of showing solidarity for the vulnerable and promoting justice. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, place-making can catalyze and nurture them, and over time advance justice. On the moral landscapes of bioethics, the terrain where care and health are or should be at the center of attention, an ethic of place and place-making for those who have been displaced - patients, the elderly, urban populations, and asylum-seekers, for instance - expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity.
